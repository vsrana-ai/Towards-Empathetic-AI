3;high;diet and weight loss management;0;client;Well, see, my wife’s been getting on me a lot lately about improving my health habits. I don’t really see what the big problem is, though. I mean, I’ve been working really hard. Sometimes I can’t make it home for dinner, so I end up eating out at places like Applebee’s. But she seems to think it’s a bigger deal than it is.;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;1;therapist;It sounds like your wife is coming from a place of care, but you’re feeling like her concerns might not fully align with how you see things right now. Is that right?;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;2;client;Yeah, exactly. I mean, I feel fine. I don’t see why she’s so worried.;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;3;therapist;Got it. So, from your perspective, you’re feeling okay, and her concerns feel a bit over the top. Can you tell me more about how you’re feeling physically? Like, how’s your energy level or how you’re keeping up with your work?;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;4;client;Oh, I feel good. My job is pretty physically demanding—I’m out in the hot sun most of the day, doing a lot of manual labor. I’m always sweating, so I figure I’m burning off anything unhealthy I might eat.;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;5;therapist;That makes sense. It sounds like your job keeps you active, and you feel like that balances things out. Have you noticed any changes in how your body feels, though? Like, maybe your weight or how your clothes fit?;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;6;client;Well, I’ve put on a little weight, but it’s nothing crazy. I don’t feel bloated or anything like that.;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;7;therapist;Okay. And have you had a chance to check in with a doctor recently, just to see how things are going health-wise?;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;8;client;Yeah, I had a physical last year. Everything came back normal, so I haven’t really thought much about it since then.;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;9;therapist;That’s good to hear. So, overall, you’re feeling pretty good, and the doctor didn’t raise any concerns. But it sounds like your wife’s worries are still on your mind. How do you feel about her bringing this up so often?;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;10;client;I mean, I know she’s coming from a good place. She loves me and wants me to be healthy and live a long life. But sometimes, after a long day at work, going out to eat feels like a little reward, you know? It helps me unwind.;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;11;therapist;Absolutely. It sounds like those meals out are more than just food—they’re a way to take care of yourself emotionally after a tough day. At the same time, it seems like you’re open to understanding why your wife might be concerned. Would it be okay if we explored that a bit? Maybe talk about how small changes could fit into your routine without taking away those moments that help you feel good?;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;12;client;Yeah, I’m open to that. I mean, I do want to make sure I’m healthy for her and for myself.;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;13;therapist;That’s a great mindset. Let’s start with some small, manageable steps. For example, have you ever thought about how small tweaks to your meals—whether at home or eating out—could make a difference over time? It doesn’t have to be all or nothing.;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;14;client;Yeah, I guess I could try that. I don’t want to give up eating out entirely, but maybe I could make better choices when I do.;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;15;therapist;That’s a really practical approach. Small changes can add up, and they don’t have to take away from the enjoyment you get from those meals. How does that sound to you?;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;16;client;It sounds good. I’m willing to give it a try.;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;17;therapist;That’s great to hear. Let’s take it one step at a time and see how it goes. And remember, I’m here to support you through this process.;;;
4;high;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Emily. It’s good to see you again. How have you been?;;;
4;high;managing life;1;client;Hi. Yeah, I’ve been okay. It’s been a while, huh?;;;
4;high;managing life;2;therapist;It has. I noticed something new about you today—your lip piercing. It looks great! How long have you had it?;;;.,
4;high;managing life;3;client;Thanks! I got it about a month ago.;;;
4;high;managing life;4;therapist;A month ago? What inspired you to get it?;;;
4;high;managing life;5;client;I don’t know, really. I just wanted to try something different. I was feeling kind of stuck, and I thought it might be fun to stand out a little.;;;
4;high;managing life;6;therapist;That makes sense. Sometimes a change can feel refreshing. How has it been for you so far?;;;
4;high;managing life;7;client;It’s been good. I like how it looks, and it’s been a fun little change.;;;
4;high;managing life;8;therapist;That’s great to hear. You know, as your dentist, I do have some concerns about how oral piercings can affect teeth and gums. Have you heard much about that?;;;
4;high;managing life;9;client;Not really. I mean, I guess it could push on my gums or teeth, but I’m not sure how much of an issue it would actually be. My teeth are pretty strong, so I haven’t worried too much.;;;
4;high;managing life;10;therapist;That’s true—you do have strong, healthy teeth, which is something we’ve always worked to maintain. But I’ve seen some patients with oral piercings develop gum erosion or even chipped teeth from the jewelry. What are your thoughts on that?;;;
4;high;managing life;11;client;Oh, I didn’t realize it could chip teeth. I definitely don’t want to mess up my teeth. I know you’ve mentioned my gums are already a bit low, and I’m supposed to be flossing more… which, uh, I’m still working on.;;;
4;high;managing life;12;therapist;[chuckles] Yes, flossing is always a work in progress for most of us. But it’s good you’re aware of your gum health. If you noticed any changes, like gum recession or tooth damage, how would you feel about the piercing then?;;;
4;high;managing life;13;client;I guess if I saw it was causing problems, I’d probably take it out. I mean, I like it, but my teeth are more important. I just got it, though, so I haven’t noticed anything yet.;;;
4;high;managing life;14;therapist;That’s fair. It’s still pretty new, and you’re paying attention to how it feels. What would help you stay aware of any potential issues as time goes on?;;;
4;high;managing life;15;client;I guess I’d just keep an eye on it. If I noticed my gums looking different or my teeth feeling weird, I’d probably rethink it. But for now, it’s just kind of a fun thing.;;;
4;high;managing life;16;therapist;That sounds like a balanced approach. You’re enjoying it while also being mindful of your health. You mentioned earlier that your teeth are more important—that’s a really thoughtful perspective. How do you feel about balancing self-expression, like the piercing, with taking care of your teeth?;;;
4;high;managing life;17;client;I mean, I want both, but if I had to choose, I’d pick my teeth. They’re kind of permanent, you know? The piercing might not last forever, but I’m hoping my teeth will.;;;
4;high;managing life;18;therapist;You said that so well, Emily. The piercing is temporary, but your teeth are for life. It’s clear you’ve thought this through. Thanks for sharing your perspective with me. Before we move on to the exam, let’s talk about flossing—how’s that going for you lately?;;;
4;high;managing life;19;client;[laughs] Oh, flossing… yeah, I’m still trying to get better at that. I know I need to do it more.;;;
4;high;managing life;20;therapist;It’s a process, and I’m here to help. Let’s brainstorm some ways to make it easier for you. What’s been the biggest challenge with flossing regularly?;;;
4;high;managing life;21;client;I think I just forget to do it. I’m not in the habit yet.;;;
4;high;managing life;22;therapist;That’s a common hurdle. What if we tried tying it to something you already do every day, like brushing your teeth? Could that help you remember?;;;
4;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah, that might work. I’ll give it a try.;;;
4;high;managing life;24;therapist;Great! Small steps can make a big difference. Let’s check in on that next time. Ready for your exam?;;;
4;high;managing life;25;client;Sure, let’s do it.;;;
6;high;asthma management;0;therapist;Hi, Sal. Thanks for coming in today. I know it’s not always easy to make time for these appointments, so I really appreciate you being here.;;;
6;high;asthma management;1;client;Yeah, no problem. I mean, it’s a bit of a hassle, but I’m here.;;;
6;high;asthma management;2;therapist;I saw that your doctor referred you, and I’m curious—what’s your understanding of why she thought it might be helpful for us to talk?;;;
6;high;asthma management;3;client;I don’t know, honestly. She’s been on me about making more changes—quit smoking, cut back on drinking, even getting rid of my dog. It’s like, what else does she want from me?;;;
6;high;asthma management;4;therapist;It sounds like there’s a lot on your plate right now. Not just the asthma, but other things too.;;;
6;high;asthma management;5;client;Yeah, it’s a lot. My wife’s still on maternity leave, so she’s not getting paid, and I’m the only one working right now. Plus, all these changes I’m supposed to make—it’s just… a lot.;;;
6;high;asthma management;6;therapist;It sounds overwhelming, like you’re juggling so much at once.;;;
6;high;asthma management;7;client;Yeah, it really is. It’s like everything’s piling up, and I don’t even know where to start.;;;
6;high;asthma management;8;therapist;I hear that. It’s tough when it feels like everything’s coming at you all at once. We’ve got about 20 minutes today, and I wonder if it would be helpful to take a step back and look at everything that’s going on. Maybe we can figure out what feels most important to focus on right now. How does that sound?;;;
6;high;asthma management;9;client;Yeah, I guess that makes sense. It’s all over the place, but we’ve got to start somewhere, right?;;;
6;high;asthma management;10;therapist;Exactly. Sometimes it helps to just lay everything out and see what’s most pressing. I’ve got a kind of worksheet here—it’s just a way to list out the things that are on your mind or that others are suggesting you work on. And just to be clear, Sal, listing them doesn’t mean you have to do anything about them right now. This is about you deciding what feels most important to you.;;;
6;high;asthma management;11;client;Okay, that sounds good. As long as it’s not like, “You have to fix all this right now.”;;;
6;high;asthma management;12;therapist;Not at all. You’re in the driver’s seat here. So, what’s one thing that comes to mind?;;;
6;high;asthma management;13;client;Well, my asthma’s been acting up a lot lately.;;;
6;high;asthma management;14;therapist;Okay, so asthma is one. What else?;;;
6;high;asthma management;15;client;Um, the whole thing about my dog, Oscar. The doctor says he’s making my asthma worse and that I should get rid of him.;;;
6;high;asthma management;16;therapist;That’s a big one. It sounds like that’s really hitting hard for you.;;;
6;high;asthma management;17;client;Yeah, it’s… it’s a lot. I’ve had Oscar longer than I’ve known my wife. He’s like my best friend. I can’t just get rid of him like that.;;;
6;high;asthma management;18;therapist;It’s not just a pet—it’s a relationship. That’s a huge thing to be asked to give up.;;;
6;high;asthma management;19;client;Exactly. It’s really stressing me out.;;;
6;high;asthma management;20;therapist;I can imagine. What else is on your mind?;;;
6;high;asthma management;21;client;Well, I’ve been trying to cut down on smoking, but it’s hard. And finances are a mess right now—my wife’s not working, and I’m taking time off for all these appointments, which isn’t helping.;;;
6;high;asthma management;22;therapist;So smoking, finances, and the time these appointments take—those are all connected, it sounds like.;;;
6;high;asthma management;23;client;Yeah, and there’s the drinking too. I’m supposed to cut back on that as well.;;;
6;high;asthma management;24;therapist;Wow, Sal, that’s a lot to manage. It’s no wonder you’re feeling overwhelmed. If you had to pick one or two things to focus on today, what would feel most important to you?;;;
6;high;asthma management;25;client;I think the dog situation is really bothering me. And my asthma—it’s been out of control lately.;;;
6;high;asthma management;26;therapist;Okay, so Oscar and your asthma. Those seem pretty connected, don’t they?;;;
6;high;asthma management;27;client;Yeah, they are. I just don’t know what to do about it.;;;
6;high;asthma management;28;therapist;It’s a tough spot to be in. How about we spend some time exploring that? Maybe we can look at what’s most important to you about Oscar and how that fits with managing your asthma. Does that sound okay?;;;
6;high;asthma management;29;client;Yeah, that sounds good.;;;
6;high;asthma management;30;therapist;Great. Let’s start there.;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist So, I understand you sprained your ankle yesterday. Can you tell me a little more about how that happened?;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client Ugh, it’s so embarrassing. I was at a 90s-themed pub crawl last night, and, well, you know how those go—lots of drinks, lots of fun. I was trying to catch up with my friends who were ahead of me, and I thought it’d be a great idea to jump off the bus stairs… in stilettos. Yeah, not my brightest moment. I landed wrong and twisted my ankle. It was so awkward.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist Ouch. That sounds like quite the night! How are you feeling about it now?;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client Honestly? A little frustrated with myself. I mean, it was fun until that moment, but now I’m stuck with this ankle and a killer hangover.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist It sounds like you’re reflecting on the consequences of last night. I’m curious—how does this fit into your usual routine? Do nights like this happen often?;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client I mean, not every night, but weekends are usually when I let loose. I’m a university student, so it’s pretty normal to go out with friends and have a few drinks.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist Got it. So, weekends are your time to unwind and socialize. When you say “a few drinks,” what does that look like for you?;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client Well, if we’re going out, it’s more than a few. I’d say… seven or eight drinks, maybe? And sometimes I’ll have a beer or two during the week if I’ve had a long day studying.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist I see. So, it sounds like alcohol plays a role in both your social life and your downtime. How do you feel about that balance right now?;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client I don’t know. I guess I haven’t really thought about it. It just feels normal, you know? Everyone around me is doing the same thing.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist That makes sense. It can be hard to step back and evaluate something when it feels like the norm. I’m wondering—have you ever thought about how your drinking might be affecting you, physically or otherwise?;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client I mean, I definitely feel it today. My ankle hurts, I’m exhausted, and I know I’m not as productive when I’m hungover. So, yeah, there’s that.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist It sounds like you’re noticing some downsides. Do you think there could be benefits to cutting back a little, even just to see how it feels?;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client Maybe. I do like the idea of feeling better and getting more done. But I don’t know—it’s such a big part of my social life.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist That’s a really valid point. Balancing social connections with personal well-being can be tricky. What if we took a moment to look at some guidelines for low-risk drinking? It might help give you a clearer picture of what’s considered safe.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client Sure, I guess that could be interesting.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist Great. For women, the low-risk guideline is about 10 drinks per week, with no more than 2 drinks a day. How does that compare to what you’re currently drinking?;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client Oh, wow. I’m definitely over that. Especially during midterms—I feel like I drink more to deal with the stress.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist It sounds like stress plays a big role in your drinking habits. Do you think there are other ways you could manage that stress, or is alcohol the go-to for now?;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client I mean, I know there are other ways, but drinking is just… easier, I guess.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist That’s understandable. It’s hard to change habits, especially when they feel like a quick fix. But it sounds like you’re already noticing some benefits to cutting back—like feeling more productive and avoiding hangovers.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client Yeah, that’s true. I do like the idea of feeling better overall.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist That’s a great insight. It sounds like you’re open to exploring this further. Would you be interested in coming back to talk more about this when you’re feeling a bit better? Maybe we could brainstorm some strategies to help you balance socializing and well-being.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client Yeah, I think that could be helpful. Maybe not right now, though—I’m still recovering from last night.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist Of course. How about we schedule something for later this week or early next week? That way, you’ll have some time to reflect and we can dive deeper when you’re ready.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client That works for me. Just not on a Saturday morning—I’ll probably be recovering again. [laughs];;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist [chuckles] Fair enough. Let’s find a time that works for you. Thanks for being so open today—it’s not easy to reflect on these things, and I really appreciate your honesty.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client Thanks. I think it’s good to talk about it, even if it’s a little uncomfortable.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist Absolutely. I’ll see you soon, and take care of that ankle in the meantime.;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client Will do. Thanks!;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;0;interlocutor;utterance_text;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;1;therapist;So, Bob, what brings you in today? What’s on your mind, and how can I help?;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;2;client;Honestly, I’m only here because my wife thinks I have a problem with smoking. I’ve been smoking most of my life, and it’s never been an issue—until six months ago. She got into this health kick, and now she’s on this mission to get me to quit. I’m here to make her happy, but honestly, I don’t see the big deal.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;3;therapist;It sounds like this isn’t something you’d choose to do on your own. You’re here more for her than for yourself.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;4;client;Exactly. I mean, I’m supposed to be at work right now. This is costing me time and money, and I’m only here because she’s been nagging me nonstop for months. She quit smoking, and now she expects me to do the same.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;5;therapist;That must feel frustrating—like you’re being pushed into something you’re not ready for. What’s it been like for you, having her and maybe others pressuring you to quit?;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;6;client;It’s been awful. She’s cut out all these articles about smoking and makes me read them over breakfast. We used to smoke together, and now I have to go outside in the cold while she acts like she’s better than me. And now she’s got the kids on her side too—it’s like they’re all ganging up on me.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;7;therapist;So, it’s not just about the smoking anymore—it’s about feeling isolated, like everyone’s turned against you. That must be really tough.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;8;client;Yeah, it is. I mean, I love my family, and I don’t want to lose them over this. But it feels like they’re asking me to change everything overnight, and I don’t know if I can do that.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;9;therapist;It sounds like your family means a lot to you, and you’re worried this could drive a wedge between you. At the same time, quitting smoking feels like a huge, overwhelming task. Is that right?;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;10;client;Yeah, that’s it exactly. I’ve thought about quitting before, but it’s not easy. My dad’s 85, and he still smokes. I don’t know if I can just stop like my wife did.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;11;therapist;It sounds like you’re caught between two things: wanting to keep your family happy and feeling like quitting smoking is this massive, almost impossible challenge. What if there were a way to approach this that didn’t feel so all-or-nothing?;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;12;client;What do you mean?;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;13;therapist;Well, quitting smoking doesn’t have to happen overnight. It’s a process, and there are ways to make it more manageable—like cutting back gradually or using tools to help you along the way. How does that sound to you?;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;14;client;That actually sounds better. I mean, I’ve been feeling like it’s either keep smoking and lose my family or quit completely and feel miserable. But if there’s a middle ground, I’d be willing to try.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;15;therapist;That’s a great perspective. It’s about finding what works for you, at your own pace. Would it help if your wife understood that too? Maybe she could join us for a session so we can all be on the same page.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;16;client;Yeah, that might help. She’s convinced I need to quit cold turkey, but if she heard from you that it’s okay to take it step by step, it might take some of the pressure off.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;17;therapist;Absolutely. If you’d like to bring her along, we can work together to create a plan that feels doable for you and reassures her that you’re taking steps toward change.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;18;client;Okay, I’ll talk to her about it. Her schedule’s pretty unpredictable, but I’ll call you tomorrow to set something up.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;19;therapist;That sounds like a good plan. I appreciate you being open to this, Bob. It’s not easy to take these steps, especially when you’re feeling pressured.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;20;client;Thanks. I guess I just needed to hear that there’s another way to do this.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;21;therapist;You’re welcome. I’m here to support you, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Thanks for coming in today.;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;22;client;Thanks. I’ll be in touch.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;0;Therapist;Hi there! How are you doing today?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;1;Client;I’m okay, I guess. Just a bit overwhelmed.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;2;Therapist;I can understand that. It sounds like you’ve got a lot on your mind. What’s been going on?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;3;Client;Well, I just got diagnosed with diabetes. My doctor said my blood sugar is really high, and I need to make a lot of changes.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;4;Therapist;That’s a big piece of news to take in. How are you feeling about the diagnosis?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;5;Client;Honestly, I’m scared. My doctor was really serious about it—she mentioned things like losing my eyesight or even my feet if I don’t manage it. It’s a lot to process.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;6;Therapist;That sounds really overwhelming. It’s not easy to hear something like that, especially when it feels like there’s so much at stake. What stood out to you the most from what your doctor said?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;7;Client;I think just how serious it is. I didn’t realize how much damage it could do if I don’t take care of myself. But it feels like there’s so much to do—medication, diet, exercise… I don’t even know where to start.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;8;Therapist;It’s completely normal to feel that way. It sounds like you’re aware of the importance of managing this, but it also feels like a huge mountain to climb. What do you think would be the smallest step you could take to start moving in the right direction?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;9;Client;I guess… maybe looking at my diet? I know I don’t eat the best, and that’s something I could try to change. But it’s hard—I’m so used to eating the way I do.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;10;Therapist;That’s a great starting point. Changing habits can be challenging, especially when they’ve been part of your life for a long time. What do you think might help you make those changes?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;11;Client;I’m not sure. Maybe finding some healthier recipes or something? I don’t know if I can do it all at once, though.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;12;Therapist;That’s a really practical idea. Taking it one step at a time can make it feel less overwhelming. What’s one small change you could make this week to your diet that feels manageable?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;13;Client;Maybe cutting back on soda? I drink a lot of it, and I know it’s not good for me.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;14;Therapist;That’s a great first step. Small changes like that can add up over time. How do you think cutting back on soda might help you feel more in control of your health?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;15;Client;I think it would make me feel like I’m doing something, you know? Like I’m not just sitting here waiting for things to get worse.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;16;Therapist;That’s a really powerful insight. Taking action, even in small ways, can help you feel more empowered. How do you think you’ll feel if you’re able to make that change this week?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;17;Client;I think I’d feel proud of myself. Like I’m finally taking steps to take care of myself.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;18;Therapist;That’s wonderful. It sounds like you’re ready to start making some changes, and that’s a big deal. Let’s work together to figure out how to support you in this process. What else do you think might help you stay on track?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;19;Client;Maybe having someone to check in with? Like, someone who can help me stay accountable.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;20;Therapist;That’s a great idea. Having support can make a big difference. Would you like us to schedule regular check-ins to see how you’re doing with these changes?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;21;Client;Yeah, that would help. I think knowing I have someone to talk to about it would make it easier.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;22;Therapist;Absolutely. We’re in this together, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Let’s start with cutting back on soda this week and see how that goes. How does that sound?;;;
10;low;diabetes management;23;Client;That sounds good. I think I can do that. Thanks for helping me break it down—it feels a little less overwhelming now.;;;
10;low;diabetes management;24;Therapist;You’re very welcome. Remember, change is a process, and it’s okay to take it one step at a time. You’re already taking a big step by being here and being willing to make changes. I’m looking forward to seeing your progress.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;0;Therapist;What else has brought you here today?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;1;Client;They found a little bag of weed on me.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;2;Therapist;I see. How are you feeling about that?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;3;Client;I mean, it’s not a big deal. It’s just a little bit.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;4;Therapist;So, it’s not a lot, and it sounds like it’s something you don’t see as a huge issue?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;5;Client;Yeah, exactly. It’s not like I was gonna sell it or anything. It’s just for me.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;6;Therapist;Got it. So, it’s more for personal use, and you don’t feel like it’s a major concern?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;7;Client;Yeah, I mean, it’s California. Everyone does it. No one really cares.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;8;Therapist;That’s true—it’s legal here. But I’m curious, how do you feel about being here today?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;9;Client;I just wanna get this over with, you know?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;10;Therapist;It sounds like you’re focused on moving forward and putting this behind you. Is that right?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;11;Client;Yeah, exactly. I just wanna do what I need to do and move on.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;12;Therapist;That makes sense. It’s important to you to get this resolved. How do you see this process helping you?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;13;Client;I don’t know. I guess just getting it done so I don’t have to deal with it anymore.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;14;Therapist;Okay. So, it’s about finding a way to close this chapter for you. Would it be helpful if we worked together to figure out what steps might make that happen?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;15;Client;Yeah, I guess so.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;16;Therapist;Great. I have a form we can use to map out some ideas together—kind of like a roadmap for our sessions. Would you be open to that?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;17;Client;Sure, why not.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;18;Therapist;Perfect. Let’s start by exploring what’s most important to you right now. What would you like to focus on first?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;19;Client;I don’t know. Maybe just figuring out how to get this whole thing over with.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;20;Therapist;That’s a good starting point. Let’s break it down. What do you think might help you feel like you’re making progress?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;21;Client;I guess just knowing what I need to do and doing it.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;22;Therapist;That sounds like a clear plan. Let’s work on identifying those steps together. How does that sound?;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;23;Client;Yeah, that works.;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;24;Therapist;Great. I’m here to support you in this process. Let’s take it one step at a time.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Sarah, I’m really glad you came in today. We’ve covered a lot, but I’d like to ask you a bit more about your smoking. Is that okay?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah, sure.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Great. You mentioned earlier that your smoking has increased a bit. About how many cigarettes are you smoking in a day now?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Um, I guess… once in the morning, once during lunch, and then maybe five or six in the evening.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay, so around eight cigarettes a day—just under half a pack. Has this been a recent change?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Yeah, over the past year or so. It’s been creeping up.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;I see. And it sounds like most of that increase is in the evenings?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Yeah. I have a two-year-old, so I wait until he’s asleep. It’s my time to unwind.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;That makes sense. You’ve got a lot on your plate—working full-time, night classes, and being a mom. It’s understandable you’d want that time to relax.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Exactly. It’s my only real downtime.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;What else do you do in the evenings to unwind?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Sometimes I’ll have a drink or two.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Got it. About how many drinks would you say you have in a week?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;13;client;I don’t know… maybe two a day, max? But honestly, I’m not here to talk about drinking.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;I completely understand, Sarah. My goal isn’t to judge or tell you what to do. I’m here to listen and share information so you can make the best decisions for your health. Does that sound okay?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Yeah, I guess.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Thanks. We know smoking and drinking can impact health, and I want to make sure you have all the resources you need to feel your best. What are your thoughts on that?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;17;client;I mean, I don’t think I smoke or drink that much compared to other people. I’ve actually been trying to cut back.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;That’s great to hear—you’re already making an effort. If you don’t mind, I’d like to use a readiness ruler. On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not ready to quit at all and 10 is totally ready, where would you say you are?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Hmm… maybe a five?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;A five—that’s a good starting point. What makes you say five instead of a lower number?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Well, you mentioned cancer risks, and as a mom, I don’t want to risk my health.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;That’s really important—your health matters, not just for you but for your family too. What do you think might help you move closer to a 10?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;23;client;I could try cutting back in the evenings. Maybe smoke three instead of five or six.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;That’s a big step! Cutting back by half is a great goal. How about we check in again in four weeks to see how it’s going?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Sure, that works.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Perfect. We’ll review your lab results then, too. Would you like some information on quitting smoking?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Yeah, that’d be helpful.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Here’s a brochure with some tips, like distraction techniques for cravings. Many patients have found it useful. Also, would you be open to talking with one of our counselors?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;29;client;What for?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Dr. Kirtley specializes in stress and alcohol use. Since you mentioned stress and having a couple of drinks to unwind, he could help you explore healthier ways to manage it. What do you think?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;31;client;I’d be open to talking about stress, but I’m not sure about the drinking part.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;That’s totally fine. Let’s set up an appointment with Dr. Kirtley to focus on stress, and we’ll see how it goes. Before you leave, we’ll schedule your next visit with me and the counseling session. Does that sound good?;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Yeah, that works.;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Great. It was really nice meeting you, Sarah. I’ll see you in four weeks!;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;35;client;Thanks. See you then.;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Hi, Mrs. Smith. Thanks for coming in today. We’re scheduled to give Lilly some vaccines. How are you feeling about that?;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Oh, um… I’m not sure. I’ve been reading a lot about vaccines lately, and I’m a little worried.;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;I hear that. It’s great that you’re looking into this—it shows how much you care about Lilly’s health. What specifically has been on your mind?;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Well, I’ve read that it’s better for kids to build up their immunity naturally, you know, through their own immune systems.;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;That’s an interesting perspective. So, you’re thinking that natural exposure to illnesses might be a safer or more effective way for Lilly to build immunity?;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;Yeah, exactly. Like, I had chickenpox as a kid, and now I’m immune. So, isn’t that better?;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;That makes sense. Having chickenpox did give you natural immunity, and that’s one way the body can protect itself. Would it be okay if I shared some information about how vaccines work and why they’re recommended?;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Sure, I guess. I just want to make sure I’m doing the right thing for her.;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;Of course, and that’s exactly what we’re here to figure out together. Before vaccines were available, many children got very sick from diseases like measles, polio, and whooping cough. Some even died or had lifelong disabilities, like paralysis or brain damage. Vaccines were developed to protect kids from those risks.;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;Wow, I didn’t realize it was that serious. I’ve never even heard of polio.;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;That’s actually a good thing—it means vaccines have been so effective that many of these diseases are rare now. But because of that, it’s easy to forget how dangerous they can be. How does this information sit with you?;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;I mean, I guess it makes sense. I just want Lilly to be healthy and safe. I don’t want to take any chances with her.;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;That’s completely understandable. It’s clear how much you care about her well-being. Vaccines are one way to help protect her from those serious risks. How do you feel about moving forward with them today?;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;I think it’s okay. I just want to do what’s best for her.;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;Therapist;That’s a great mindset. It’s always good to ask questions and make informed decisions. You’re doing a wonderful job as a parent, Mrs. Smith. Let’s take it step by step, and I’m here to answer any other questions you might have.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Therapist;So, I hear your overall goal is to not give up the things you enjoy but to cut back on how much you have. Is that right?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;Yeah, that’s pretty much it. I don’t want to completely stop, but I need to find a better balance.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;That makes sense. It sounds like this is really important to you. On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident and 10 is extremely confident, how confident are you right now about starting this new plan?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;Hmm, I’d say about a six.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;A six. That’s a good starting point. What makes it a six and not lower?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;Well, I’ve wanted to make this change for a long time. Ever since I was a teenager, I’ve been conscious of my health and how I feel in my body.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;That’s a long time to carry this goal. What’s kept it alive for you all these years?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;I think it’s because I’ve always admired my friends who are really active and healthy. They play soccer, hike, and just seem so energetic. I want to feel that way too—not necessarily to look like them, but to feel strong and confident in myself.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;That’s a powerful motivation—wanting to feel strong and confident. What would it mean to you to achieve that?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;It would mean everything. I’d feel like I’m finally taking control of my life and doing something for myself.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;That’s a really meaningful vision. So, if we go back to the scale, you said you’re at a six right now, but you mentioned that when you go home and see the food, it might drop to a four. What’s different about the times when you feel more confident versus when you feel less confident?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;I think it’s about mindset. When I’m here talking about it, I feel motivated and ready to take it on. But at home, it’s like reality hits, and I get overwhelmed by how hard it feels.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;That’s a really honest reflection. It’s common for motivation to shift depending on the situation. What do you think could help you bridge that gap between feeling motivated here and staying motivated at home?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;I’m not entirely sure. Maybe having a plan or some kind of structure? Like, if I knew exactly what to do instead of just winging it, I might feel more in control.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;That’s a great insight. Having a plan can definitely help with feeling more in control. Let’s explore that a bit. What would a realistic, manageable plan look like for you?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Client;Maybe starting small, like cutting back on snacks during the week and saving them for the weekend. Or finding healthier alternatives for the foods I really love.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;16;Therapist;Those are excellent ideas. Starting small and building from there can make the process feel less overwhelming. What strengths do you think you have that could help you stick to this plan?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;17;Client;I’m pretty determined when I set my mind to something. And I’ve done hard things before, like when I trained for a 5K a few years ago. I didn’t think I could do it, but I stuck with it and finished the race.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;18;Therapist;That’s amazing! It sounds like you have a lot of resilience and determination. How did you stay motivated during that time?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;19;Client;I think it was because I had a clear goal and a timeline. I also had a friend who trained with me, so we kept each other accountable.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;20;Therapist;That’s a great example of using structure and support to achieve a goal. Do you think something similar could work for this situation?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;21;Client;Yeah, maybe. I could set smaller goals, like cutting back on one thing at a time, and maybe ask a friend to check in with me about it.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;22;Therapist;That sounds like a solid plan. It’s clear you’ve thought a lot about this and have some great ideas. How do you feel now about moving forward with this approach?;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;23;Client;I feel better about it. It still feels challenging, but I think I can do it if I take it step by step.;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;24;Therapist;That’s a great attitude. Remember, progress doesn’t have to be perfect—it’s about moving forward. Let’s check in next time and see how it’s going.;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Rick, let’s take a moment to reflect on your current living situation with Tristan. How do you feel it’s supporting or challenging your goals right now?;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;It’s a nice place, and it’s close to work. Living with a mate is comfortable, but… I’m not sure it’s the best for me right now.;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;It sounds like there are some positives, like convenience and companionship. But you’re also sensing it might not align with the changes you’re trying to make. Can you tell me more about that?;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Yeah, Tristan’s a good flatmate, but we’re in different places in life. He doesn’t have the same responsibilities I do, like my kids and everything. I can’t expect him to change his life just because I’m trying to change mine.;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;That’s a really thoughtful observation. It sounds like you’re recognizing that your priorities and his might not fully align. How does that feel for you?;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;It’s tough, because he’s a good friend, and he says he’ll support me. But I don’t know if he really gets what I’m going through. He doesn’t have kids or the same kind of pressures.;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;It’s hard when someone wants to support you but might not fully understand your situation. Have you thought about what kind of environment would better support the changes you’re trying to make?;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;I’ve thought about moving in with my auntie and uncle. They’re really supportive, and I know they’d help me with the kids and everything. But… I’m worried about losing my independence.;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;That’s a valid concern. Independence is important to you. Can you tell me more about what freedom means to you in this context?;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Right now, I’m in charge of myself. I make my own decisions, and I don’t have to answer to anyone. If I move in with family, I’m worried they might take over, even if they mean well.;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;It sounds like you value your autonomy, but you’re also weighing that against the support your family could provide. How do you see those two things—freedom and support—balancing out for your goals?;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I don’t want to lose my freedom, but if it means getting my kids back and building a better life for us, I’ll do whatever it takes. I just don’t want to feel like I’m giving up control.;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;That’s a powerful reflection, Rick. It sounds like your kids are your top priority, and you’re willing to make sacrifices for them. How do you think you could maintain a sense of control while also accepting support from your family?;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I guess I’d have to set some boundaries and communicate clearly with them. Maybe if I’m upfront about what I need, they’ll respect that. It’s just hard to imagine right now.;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;That’s a great insight. Setting boundaries and clear communication could help you maintain your autonomy while still receiving the support you need. How does that idea sit with you?;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;It makes sense. I think I’d feel better knowing I have a plan and that I’m not just giving up everything. I’ll have to think about it more, but it’s a step in the right direction.;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;Absolutely, Rick. It’s all about finding what works best for you and your family. You’re clearly putting a lot of thought into this, and that’s a sign of real commitment to your goals. Let’s keep exploring this together.;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;So, it sounds like you're feeling really stuck with this situation. How are you holding up?;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;Yeah, I just... I can't keep doing this. I got caught again, and now I’m suspended from school. I feel like I’m messing up my whole life.;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;That sounds really overwhelming. It seems like you’re realizing how much this is affecting you. What’s been the hardest part about all of this?;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;I don’t know... I guess it’s just that I keep getting in trouble, and I know it’s wrong, but it’s hard to stop. My friends and I, we do it together, and it’s... it’s fun, you know?;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;It sounds like there’s a part of you that enjoys the excitement of it, but at the same time, you’re seeing the consequences piling up. Is that right?;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;Yeah, exactly. It’s fun in the moment, but then I get caught, and everything falls apart. I don’t want to keep living like this.;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;It sounds like you’re really torn. On one hand, there’s the fun and connection with your friends, but on the other, there’s this growing sense that it’s costing you too much. What do you think you’d need to do to start making a change?;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;I don’t know... I guess I’d have to stop hanging out with them, but they’re my friends. I don’t want to lose them.;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;That’s a tough spot to be in. It sounds like your friendships mean a lot to you, but at the same time, you’re realizing that this might not be the healthiest way to maintain those connections. What do you think might happen if you tried to distance yourself a bit?;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;I don’t know... I guess I’d feel lonely. But maybe I could find other things to do that don’t get me in trouble.;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;That’s an interesting thought. It sounds like you’re starting to imagine other possibilities. What kind of activities or hobbies do you think might give you that same sense of excitement or connection, but in a healthier way?;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;I don’t know... maybe sports or something? I used to play basketball, and that was fun. Or maybe just hanging out without stealing stuff.;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;It sounds like you’re already brainstorming some alternatives. That’s a great start. How do you think your life might look different if you were able to make those changes?;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;I think I’d feel better about myself. I wouldn’t be so stressed about getting caught all the time. And maybe I could actually focus on school and not mess things up.;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;That sounds like a really positive vision for your future. It seems like you’re starting to see the benefits of making a change. What do you think might be the first small step you could take toward that?;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;Maybe I could talk to my friends and tell them I don’t want to do it anymore. Or just say no next time they ask.;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;That sounds like a brave and thoughtful plan. It’s not easy to make changes, especially when it involves friends, but it sounds like you’re ready to take that step. How can I support you as you move forward with this?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;So, I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden. How’s he been feeling lately?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Okay. He’s been okay, but these ear infections keep coming back. It’s really frustrating.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;I can imagine how frustrating that must be for both of you. I noticed in his chart that he’s had quite a few ear infections recently. I also saw that you mentioned someone smokes in the home. Can you tell me a little more about that?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, it’s just me and him, and I do smoke. I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I’ve been smoking for 10 years—except when I was pregnant with him. It’s just... everything is so stressful being a single mom and having a full-time job. Smoking helps me relax.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;It sounds like smoking has been a way for you to cope with all the stress and responsibilities you’re juggling.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;5;client;"Yeah, exactly. Some people have a glass of wine; I have a cigarette.";;;
20;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;That makes sense. And it sounds like you’re making an effort to protect Aiden by not smoking around him. What made you decide to do that?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;7;client;I know it’s not good for him. I’ve read about how smoking can cause ear infections and asthma and stuff. But then again, other kids get ear infections, and their parents don’t smoke.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;So, on one hand, you’re concerned about how your smoking might be affecting Aiden, but on the other hand, you’re not entirely sure if it’s the main cause of his ear infections. Is that right?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Right. He doesn’t have asthma or other major health problems. I’ve thought about quitting before, but I just don’t see how it’s possible right now.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;It sounds like quitting feels overwhelming given everything else you’re managing. What was different when you quit smoking during your pregnancy?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Well, he was inside me, and we were sharing everything. I knew the risks, and I couldn’t live with myself if something happened to him because of my smoking.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;It sounds like the stakes felt much higher back then, and that gave you the motivation to quit.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Yeah, exactly. I just did it. I didn’t want to risk anything happening to him.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;That’s really admirable. It sounds like you were able to make a big change when it felt urgent. How do you feel about the risks now?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;15;client;I don’t know... it’s different now. We’re two separate people, and I try really hard not to smoke around him. I don’t let other people smoke around him either. I’m doing the best I can.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;It sounds like you’re putting in a lot of effort to protect him, and that’s really important. At the same time, it seems like part of you still wants to quit smoking. What makes you feel that way?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;17;client;I know I need to quit. Every New Year, I say, “This is the year I’ll quit,” but then something happens, and it just doesn’t work out. I don’t want Aiden to grow up thinking smoking is okay. I don’t want him to start smoking or chewing or anything like that.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;It sounds like you have a lot of good reasons to quit—for your health, for Aiden’s health, and to set a good example for him. If you were to decide to quit, on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident do you feel about being able to do it?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Probably a 5. I know I’ve done it before, so I know I can, but it just seems really hard right now. It’s not the same situation as when I was pregnant.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;That’s a good point. It’s a different situation now, and it sounds like you’re feeling unsure about how to make it work. What makes you say 5 instead of a lower number, like 2 or 3?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;21;client;I guess because I know all the reasons why I should quit, and I’ve done it before. But it’s just... I don’t know if I can handle the stress without smoking.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;It sounds like you’re balancing a lot of reasons to quit with the challenges of managing stress. If you were to take a step toward quitting, what kind of support do you think would help you the most?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;23;client;I don’t know. I’d like some help, but I’m not sure what kind of help I need.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;That’s completely understandable. There are a lot of options out there, like medications, support groups, or even one-on-one counseling. Some people find that having a plan and support system makes a big difference. What do you think might work for you?;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;25;client;I don’t like the idea of medication, but a support group or something like that might be nice. I just don’t know if I have the time for it.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;It sounds like time is a big concern for you. What if we explored some options that could fit into your schedule? For example, there are online support groups or shorter programs that might be more manageable.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;27;client;That sounds like it could work. I’d be willing to try something like that.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;That’s great to hear. If you’re open to it, we could set up another appointment to talk more about these options and figure out what might work best for you.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;29;client;I’d like that. Thank you.;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;You’re welcome. I’m really glad we could have this conversation, and I’m here to support you every step of the way.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi, Laura. Thanks for coming in today. How are you doing?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Hi. I’m good, thanks.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;I’m glad to hear that. So, before we dive in, I’d like to give you a quick overview of what we’ll be doing today. Is that okay with you?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Yeah, sure.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Great. My goal today is to get to know you better and understand what’s important to you. We’ll talk about your life, your goals, and any changes you might be thinking about. My role is to support you, not to judge or tell you what to do. How does that sound?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;That sounds good.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Awesome. To start, can you tell me a little about yourself? What’s life like for you right now?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Well, I’m 17, a senior in high school. I’m focusing on getting good grades so I can go to college.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;That’s exciting! Do you have any ideas about where you’d like to go or what you’d like to study?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I’m thinking about pre-law, but I’m still exploring my options. Maybe a school in-state or out-of-state.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;Pre-law? That’s impressive. What draws you to that field?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I like the idea of helping people and standing up for what’s right. It feels meaningful.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;That’s a really strong motivation. It sounds like you’re someone who values fairness and making a difference. What else is important to you in life?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Family and friends, for sure. I want to make them proud and stay close to them.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Family and friends seem like a big part of your life. Can you tell me more about what those relationships mean to you?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Yeah, my family has always been supportive, and my friends are like my second family. I feel like I belong when I’m with them.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;That sense of belonging sounds really important to you. It’s great that you have such strong connections. Now, I’d like to shift gears a bit and talk about something you mentioned earlier—parties and socializing. How does that fit into your life?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I like hanging out with friends on weekends. Sometimes we go to parties or school events.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;That sounds fun. Do you ever find yourself in situations where alcohol is involved?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Yeah, sometimes. I might have a drink or two, but I don’t really drink much.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Got it. How do you feel about being in those situations?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;It’s okay, I guess. I mostly just hold a drink to fit in, so people don’t pressure me.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;It sounds like you’re navigating those situations thoughtfully. What’s it like for you when others are drinking more than you?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;It can be a little uncomfortable. Sometimes people get too loud or do things they regret. I don’t want to end up like that.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;That makes sense. It sounds like you’ve seen some of the downsides of drinking and want to avoid those experiences. How do you think alcohol fits into your future, say, when you’re in college?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;I don’t think it’ll be a big part of my life. I’ll be focused on school and my goals.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;That’s a really clear vision. What do you think might help you stay on track with that plan?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Maybe just reminding myself why I’m there—to get into law school and build a good future.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;That’s a great strategy. It sounds like you’re really motivated by your goals. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it for you to make sure drinking doesn’t get in the way of those goals?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Probably a 7 or 8. It’s not my biggest concern, but I know it could be a distraction.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;That’s a good awareness. And how confident are you that you can manage that, on the same scale?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;I’d say an 8 or 9. I don’t drink much now, so it’s not a huge change for me.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;That’s a strong confidence level. It sounds like you’re already taking steps to stay focused. What’s one small thing you could do to make sure drinking doesn’t become a bigger part of your life?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;Maybe just saying no to drinks at the next party I go to. I think I could do that.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;That’s a great goal. What do you think might be the benefits of doing that?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;I’d feel more in control, and I wouldn’t have to worry about any negative consequences.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;Those are really positive outcomes. It sounds like you’re thinking ahead and making choices that align with your values. How would you feel about checking in again to see how it’s going?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Yeah, that would be helpful.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;Great. I’m really impressed by how thoughtful you are about your future. Is there anything else you’d like to talk about today?;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;No, I think that’s it. Thanks for listening.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;Of course. Thanks for sharing so openly. I’ll see you soon, and we’ll see how things are going. Take care, Laura.;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;You too. Bye.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;0;Therapist;You mentioned that you’ve been working on your values clarification handout. I’d love to hear more about that. Can you share what your top five values are right now?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;1;Client;Sure. My top value is family happiness. That’s number one for me, especially now. I actually do this values exercise every two to three months to see if anything’s changed, and it usually does.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;2;Therapist;That’s interesting. So, family happiness is your top priority right now. What makes it so important to you at this moment?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;3;Client;Well, my family hasn’t been on the same page lately. I feel like if we could all meet in the middle, things would be better. I know I can’t change anyone else, but I can work on being more present, listening, and voicing how important family happiness is to me.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;4;Therapist;It sounds like you’re taking a lot of responsibility for improving things. Do you feel like your family knows how much this matters to you?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;5;Client;Not really. I want them to understand how important it is, especially now. That’s why I keep revisiting this exercise—to stay aware of what’s changing for me.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;6;Therapist;That’s a really thoughtful approach. It’s clear that family happiness is a priority, but you’re also aware that it’s something you can’t control entirely. What’s your second value?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;7;Client;Religion. It used to be number one, but after a big situation in my family, I’ve kind of lost some faith. It’s still important to me, but it’s not as strong as it was.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;8;Therapist;That sounds like a challenging shift. How are you feeling about that change in your faith?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;9;Client;I’m okay with it. I know it’s normal to go through periods of doubt. I still have some faith, and I’m thankful for the positive things in my life, but sometimes I wonder, “Where is God?”;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;10;Therapist;It sounds like you’ve reached a place of acceptance with where you are spiritually. That’s not easy to do, especially when others might not understand. How do you feel about the fact that your values keep changing over time?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;11;Client;At first, it was surprising, but now I accept it. Life changes, and so do I. I’ve learned not to limit myself to one way of thinking.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;12;Therapist;That’s a really mature perspective. It’s not easy to embrace change, but it sounds like you’ve grown a lot through this process. What are the other three values on your list?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;13;Client;Health, inner harmony, and security.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;14;Therapist;Those are all really important. Do you feel like you’re giving enough attention to those values right now?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;15;Client;Not really. Family happiness has been taking up most of my time and energy. I’ve been so focused on others that I’ve kind of neglected myself.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;16;Therapist;That’s a common struggle. It’s hard to find balance when you’re prioritizing others. How do you think that’s affecting your sense of inner harmony?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;17;Client;It’s definitely been harder to find peace. I haven’t been sleeping well, and I feel overwhelmed. I miss the sense of freedom and openness I used to have.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;18;Therapist;It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s taken a toll on you. What do you think might help you start reclaiming some of that inner harmony?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;19;Client;I think I need to start making time for myself again. Maybe setting boundaries so I’m not always putting everyone else first.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;20;Therapist;That’s a great insight. Setting boundaries can be really powerful. How confident do you feel about making those changes?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;21;Client;I’m not sure. It’s hard to break the habit of always putting others first, but I know I need to try.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;22;Therapist;It’s okay to take small steps. Even just recognizing the need for change is a big first step. How do you think your life might improve if you started prioritizing your own well-being?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;23;Client;I think I’d feel more balanced and less overwhelmed. I’d have more energy to give to others, too, without feeling drained.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;24;Therapist;That’s a really positive outlook. It sounds like you’re ready to start making some changes. How can I support you in this process?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;25;Client;Maybe just checking in with me about how I’m doing with it. It helps to have someone to talk to.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;26;Therapist;Absolutely. I’m here to support you. Let’s plan to check in on your progress next time. How does that sound?;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;27;Client;That sounds good. Thanks for listening.;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;28;Therapist;Of course. Thank you for sharing so openly. I’m looking forward to seeing how things unfold for you. Take care.;;;
23;high;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Hannah. It’s great to meet you. How are you feeling today?;;;
23;high;managing life;1;client;Hi. I’m… okay, I guess. A little nervous, but I’m here.;;;
23;high;managing life;2;therapist;That’s completely understandable. Starting something new can feel overwhelming.;;;
23;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah, it’s just… I’ve never really done anything like this before.;;;
23;high;managing life;4;therapist;That’s okay. It’s a big step, and I appreciate you sharing that with me.;;;
23;high;managing life;5;client;Thanks. I just… I don’t know where to start.;;;
23;high;managing life;6;therapist;That’s alright. Let’s take it one step at a time. Can you tell me a little about what brought you here today?;;;
23;high;managing life;7;client;Um, well… I’ve been feeling really anxious lately. It’s been getting worse.;;;
23;high;managing life;8;therapist;I see. How long has this been going on for you?;;;
23;high;managing life;9;client;I think it started about five or six years ago, but it’s gotten worse recently.;;;
23;high;managing life;10;therapist;What’s changed recently that’s made it feel worse?;;;
23;high;managing life;11;client;I moved out of my parents’ house a few months ago. It’s my first time living alone.;;;
23;high;managing life;12;therapist;That’s a big transition. How has that been for you?;;;
23;high;managing life;13;client;It’s been… hard. I thought it would be exciting, but I just feel really alone.;;;
23;high;managing life;14;therapist;It sounds like you were hoping for more independence, but it’s been tougher than you expected.;;;
23;high;managing life;15;client;Yeah, exactly. I thought I’d feel free, but instead, I just feel… stuck.;;;
23;high;managing life;16;therapist;That’s a really honest reflection. What does feeling “stuck” look like for you?;;;
23;high;managing life;17;client;I just stay at home a lot. I don’t go out much, and I’ve been avoiding work stuff.;;;
23;high;managing life;18;therapist;Can you tell me more about how your anxiety affects your work?;;;
23;high;managing life;19;client;I’m a photographer, and I love it, but… I keep turning down jobs because they involve working with people.;;;
23;high;managing life;20;therapist;That must be frustrating, especially when it’s something you’re passionate about.;;;
23;high;managing life;21;client;It is. I feel like I’m letting myself down, but I just can’t handle the pressure.;;;
23;high;managing life;22;therapist;It sounds like you’re caught between wanting to pursue your passion and feeling overwhelmed by the social aspects.;;;
23;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah, that’s exactly it. I don’t know how to balance it.;;;
23;high;managing life;24;therapist;Let’s explore that a bit. Can you think of a recent situation where you felt this way?;;;
23;high;managing life;25;client;Yeah, there was a job two weeks ago. It was a fashion shoot, and I thought it would be small, but there were a lot of people.;;;
23;high;managing life;26;therapist;How did that feel for you?;;;
23;high;managing life;27;client;I just… I felt like everyone was staring at me, judging me. I couldn’t focus.;;;
23;high;managing life;28;therapist;That sounds really intense. What thoughts were going through your mind at the time?;;;
23;high;managing life;29;client;I kept thinking, “They all think I’m weird. They can see how nervous I am.”;;;
23;high;managing life;30;therapist;It’s like your mind was amplifying those feelings of being judged.;;;
23;high;managing life;31;client;Yeah, and it made everything worse. I just wanted to leave.;;;
23;high;managing life;32;therapist;What did you do to cope in that moment?;;;
23;high;managing life;33;client;I just tried to focus on my camera. I held it really tight, like it was my anchor.;;;
23;high;managing life;34;therapist;That’s interesting. It sounds like the camera became a kind of safety net for you.;;;
23;high;managing life;35;client;Yeah, it’s the only thing that helps me feel in control.;;;
23;high;managing life;36;therapist;It’s great that you found a way to ground yourself. How did the rest of the day go?;;;
23;high;managing life;37;client;I left as soon as it was over. I didn’t want to be around anyone.;;;
23;high;managing life;38;therapist;It sounds like it was a really draining experience for you.;;;
23;high;managing life;39;client;It was. I just wish I could handle things better.;;;
23;high;managing life;40;therapist;It’s clear that you’re really self-aware, and that’s a great starting point. How do you feel about working on some strategies to help you feel more in control?;;;
23;high;managing life;41;client;I’d like that. I just don’t want to keep feeling this way.;;;
23;high;managing life;42;therapist;That’s a really positive mindset. Let’s take this one step at a time together.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hey, how can I help you today?;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah, I hope so. My workplace just went smoke-free, and I’m not too happy about it. I’m not planning to quit, but I was wondering if there’s anything that could help me get through the day. You know, like waiting until after work to have my beer and smoke.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;I see. So your workplace has gone smoke-free, and you’re feeling a bit frustrated about it. Is that right?;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Yeah, exactly. I’m not gonna quit smoking. I like it—it helps me relax. I don’t see what the big deal is.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Got it. Smoking feels like an important part of your routine, especially for relaxation. Can you tell me a bit more about how smoking fits into your day?;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Sure. I smoke a little less than a pack a day—it’s not too bad. I’ve been smoking for about five years now. I mean, I could quit if I wanted to, but I don’t really want to right now.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;So, smoking feels like something you enjoy and aren’t ready to give up, but you also feel confident that you could quit if you decided to. Is that accurate?;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Yeah, exactly. I could quit if I wanted to. I just don’t want to right now.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;That’s an interesting perspective. What makes you feel so confident about being able to quit if you wanted to?;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Well, I mean, I don’t see why I couldn’t. I’ve never tried to quit, but it’s just something I do for fun—on breaks at work, in the morning, and after work.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;I hear you. It’s more of a habit or something you enjoy rather than something you feel controlled by. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is “I’m not considering quitting at all” and 10 is “I’m definitely ready to quit,” where would you say you are right now?;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Probably a two. I haven’t really thought about quitting, and after this announcement at work, I’m definitely not planning to quit.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Okay, so you’re at a two. What made you say two instead of one?;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, I guess anything’s possible. Maybe I could be convinced if there were good reasons or options. Are there things I could try that might make me want to quit?;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Absolutely. There are a lot of tools and products available that can help curb the urge to smoke. For example, nicotine replacement therapies can help with withdrawal symptoms, and there are also medications your doctor could prescribe to reduce the desire to smoke.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;15;client;That’s good to know. I’m not planning to do anything today, but it’s encouraging to know there are options if I ever decide to quit.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Definitely. It’s great that you’re open to learning about your options. Going back to that scale, what do you think it would take to move you from a two to, say, a four or five?;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Hmm, I’m not sure. Maybe if one of my friends decided to quit with me, that might help. But all my friends smoke, so I don’t see that happening anytime soon.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;That’s a good point. Now that your workplace is smoke-free, do you think there might be others at work who are considering quitting?;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Oh, I hadn’t thought about that. That’s a good idea. Yeah, maybe there are.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;It sounds like you’re here mostly for information today, and that’s a great first step. Whenever you feel ready, I’m here to help you explore those options further.;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;So, Liz, what’s something you’d like to change or maybe feel two ways about right now?;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Um, I really want to start working out again. I definitely want to get back into it, have a routine, and just be healthy.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;That’s a great goal. Why do you feel like this change is important to you?;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;I’m just sick of feeling the way I do. I feel kinda sluggish, especially with winter coming. I want to have more energy.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;I hear that. It sounds like you’re looking for a way to feel more energized and less sluggish. What else is motivating you?;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;Um, I don’t like the way my clothes fit—or don’t fit me. I just don’t feel comfortable.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;So, the way your clothes fit is making you feel uncomfortable, and you’d like to change that. What else makes this important to you?;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;Well, in the past, exercise has always made me feel good—about myself and just in general. I also want to be a good example for my kids. I want them to see exercise as a normal part of life.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;That’s a powerful reason—feeling good about yourself and being a role model for your kids. So, if you were to start exercising more, how would you go about fitting it into your routine?;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;I’d probably have to sit down with my husband and figure out a good time for me to do it—maybe when he’s home with the kids. It could be mornings, evenings, or even weekends—whatever works with our schedule.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;It sounds like you’re thinking about how to balance this with your family’s routine. That’s really thoughtful. On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is “not important” and 10 is “very important,” how important is it for you to start exercising more?;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;I’d say a seven or an eight. It’s pretty important to me.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Okay, and why not a five or six?;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;Because I’m really sick of being overweight and unhealthy. It just doesn’t make me feel good, so I’m motivated to change. It’s just about getting there.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;That makes sense. So, to summarize, this is important to you because you’re feeling sluggish, unhappy with your health, and you want to set a good example for your kids. At the same time, you’re figuring out how to fit exercise into your busy family schedule. Does that sound right?;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Exactly, yeah.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;Knowing all of this, what do you think your next step might be?;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;I think I’ll start by taking advantage of the good weather and go for walks or runs. I might also look for a gym close to home—maybe one with daycare—so it’s easier to fit into my day.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;That sounds like a great plan. You’ve got some clear ideas on how to get started, and it seems like you’re ready to take those first steps.;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;Yeah, I think so.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;0;therapist;Hi there. What’s been going on with you lately?;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;1;client;I just want my phone call. That’s it.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;2;therapist;I see. I heard that your phone privileges were taken away. Can you tell me more about what happened?;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;3;client;[scoffs] Yeah. I don’t know. One of the officers has it out for me or something. He said something about my bed not being made or my attitude. I just want my call, man.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;4;therapist;That sounds frustrating. It’s actually surprising to me because, from what I’ve seen, you’ve been a model resident since you’ve been here. You’ve always made your bed, been respectful to staff and other residents. Is there something going on, especially with you getting out in three weeks? That must be a lot to handle.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;5;client;I just want to contact my mom. That’s all.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;6;therapist;I get that. You used to talk to your mom almost every other night, and now it’s been about a week without contact. That’s got to be really hard. I remember you mentioning your dad’s birthday is coming up too.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;7;client;Yeah, my dad’s birthday is tomorrow. I just wanted my call so I could talk to my mom. That’s it.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;8;therapist;I hear how important this is to you. It’s been a while since we’ve seen this kind of behavior from you, so I’m wondering if there’s more going on. For a lot of people, right before they’re about to leave, there’s a lot of anxiety and frustration. The pressure of being on the outside can start to feel overwhelming. Do you think that might be part of what’s happening for you?;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;9;client;Maybe. I don’t know. I just want to talk to my mom.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;10;therapist;That’s completely understandable. Talking to your mom seems like a way to feel connected and grounded, especially with your dad’s birthday coming up. How do you usually feel after you talk to her?;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;11;client;I feel better. Like, I can handle things.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;12;therapist;That’s really important. It sounds like those calls give you a sense of support and calm. Let’s see if we can figure out a way to help you get back on track with your phone privileges. What do you think you need to do to make that happen?;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;13;client;I don’t know. Maybe talk to the officer or something.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;14;therapist;That’s a good idea. Sometimes, having a conversation and explaining your side can help clear things up. Would you be open to that?;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;15;client;Yeah, I guess.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;16;therapist;Great. Let’s work on that together. In the meantime, is there anything else that helps you feel calm or supported, especially with everything coming up?;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;17;client;I don’t know. Just… I just want to talk to my mom.;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;18;therapist;I hear you. Let’s focus on making that happen. You’ve got a lot on your plate right now, and it’s okay to feel this way. We’ll take it one step at a time.;;;
27;low;asthma management;0;therapist;I understand that your asthma symptoms have been really out of control lately. Let’s talk about ways to help you get healthy and avoid coming back here.;;;
27;low;asthma management;1;client;Yeah, I definitely don’t want to come back here. But the doctor said Oscar, my dog, might be connected to my asthma symptoms. The thing is, I’ve had him for 12 years, and it’s never been a problem before.;;;
27;low;asthma management;2;therapist;It sounds like you’re surprised by that connection. Have you had a chance to look at the materials the clinic gave you about managing asthma and how pets can affect it?;;;
27;low;asthma management;3;client;Yeah, I’ve seen the materials, and I’ve even read them. But all I’ve been doing is taking my medicine. I don’t know much about this stuff.;;;
27;low;asthma management;4;therapist;I see. It sounds like you’ve been following your medication routine, but you’re not entirely sure about the other factors, like pets. I also noticed from your chart that you have a young baby, John Carlo, and that you’ve been really proactive about your health—like almost quitting smoking. That’s fantastic.;;;
27;low;asthma management;5;client;Yeah, John Carlo’s fine. He doesn’t have asthma from the dog. It’s just me. I don’t get why this is suddenly a problem.;;;
27;low;asthma management;6;therapist;I hear your frustration. It’s not easy to hear that something you’ve had for 12 years might be affecting your health now. But your asthma symptoms are getting worse, and you’ve had a few major attacks recently. This is serious, Sal. Severe asthma can be life-threatening, and we need to take it very seriously.;;;
27;low;asthma management;7;client;So, you’re saying Oscar could make me die? He hasn’t made me die in 12 years. The doctor mentioned stress, finances, even drinking. Why are we focusing on Oscar?;;;
27;low;asthma management;8;therapist;I understand how hard this is to hear. But asthma can change over time, and what didn’t affect you before might be affecting you now. Your medication strength has been increasing, and there’s only so much medicine can do. We need to look at other ways to manage your symptoms.;;;
27;low;asthma management;9;client;Well, they can just keep giving me stronger medicine. I’ll keep taking it, and I’ll keep Oscar.;;;
27;low;asthma management;10;therapist;Sal, you’re already on one of the strongest medications. If Oscar is that important to you, I need to understand why. Do you feel like keeping him is more important than your health, your baby, or your wife?;;;
27;low;asthma management;11;client;I get that my health is important, but you don’t understand my situation. Oscar’s been with me for 12 years. I’m not just going to kick him out without knowing for sure if he’s the main problem.;;;
27;low;asthma management;12;therapist;I hear how much Oscar means to you, and I respect that. This isn’t an easy decision. Let’s take a step back and explore this together. What would it take for you to feel more confident about whether Oscar is affecting your asthma?;;;
27;low;asthma management;13;client;I don’t know. Maybe more tests or something. I just need to be sure.;;;
27;low;asthma management;14;therapist;That’s a good idea. We can look into more tests or other ways to confirm the connection. In the meantime, is there anything else you’re willing to try to help manage your symptoms?;;;
27;low;asthma management;15;client;I guess I could try keeping Oscar out of certain rooms or cleaning more often. But I’m not ready to give him up.;;;
27;low;asthma management;16;therapist;That’s a great start. Small changes can make a big difference. Let’s work on a plan that keeps you healthy while respecting how much Oscar means to you. How does that sound?;;;
27;low;asthma management;17;client;Yeah, that sounds okay.;;;
27;low;asthma management;18;therapist;Great. Let’s take it one step at a time. You’re doing the right thing by being open to exploring this.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hi Carrie, thanks for coming in today. How are you doing?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Thank you. I’m okay, just dealing with some ongoing issues.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;I see. What brings you in today?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I’ve been struggling with smoking for a long time, and I really want to quit.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;It sounds like quitting smoking is something you’ve been thinking about for a while. What makes it important for you to quit right now?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;5;client;I have a 15-year-old daughter who’s really against it. Plus, I have asthma, chronic bronchitis, and early-stage emphysema. I’m having a hard time breathing, especially when I exercise. And, honestly, smoking is just so socially unacceptable now.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;It sounds like there are a lot of reasons for you to quit—your health, your daughter, and the way smoking is viewed these days. It’s not easy, but it’s great that you’re thinking about this. Can you tell me more about how your daughter feels about your smoking?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;7;client;She hates it. She walks in and goes, “Ugh,” especially when her friends are around. It’s embarrassing for her, and honestly, it’s embarrassing for me too.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;That must be tough. It sounds like you want to be a good role model for her, especially at her age when she might be influenced to start smoking herself.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Exactly. I don’t want her to go down that path.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;That’s a really powerful motivation. You also mentioned your health—asthma, chronic bronchitis, and early-stage emphysema. That’s a lot to manage. Can you tell me more about how these conditions affect you?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;11;client;It’s scary. I remember one time, years ago, when my daughter was about five, I was struggling to breathe because of the humidity. I stuck my head out the window, gasping for air, and she got so scared she called 911. They had to take me out on a stretcher, and she was terrified she was going to lose me.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;That must have been so frightening for both of you. It sounds like your daughter really cares about you. How did that experience affect you?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;13;client;It was a wake-up call, but I still haven’t been able to quit. I’ve tried Chantix a couple of times, but it didn’t work for me.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Tell me more about your experience with Chantix. What happened when you tried it?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;15;client;I had really bad side effects—nightmares, nausea, stomach problems, and agitation. It just wasn’t worth it, especially since it didn’t stop me from smoking.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;That sounds really tough. It’s not easy to stick with something when it makes you feel worse. Have there been other times when you’ve tried to quit?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Only when I was in the hospital. Even then, I snuck out for a cigarette. The longest I’ve gone without smoking is maybe three days, and that was only because I couldn’t smoke.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Three days is still a big deal. What was that like for you?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;19;client;"It was hard. I couldn’t stop thinking about smoking. It’s like how a chocoholic craves chocolate—I just wanted a cigarette. The first chance I got, I didn’t even care what brand it was; I just needed one.";;;
28;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;"It sounds like smoking is tied to a lot of things for you—stress, routines, even your morning coffee. It’s not just the nicotine; it’s the habit too.";;;
28;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Exactly. It’s like a double addiction—physical and mental.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;That’s a really good way to put it. Smoking does a lot of things for you, but it also comes with a cost, especially to your health. What do you think about that balance?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;23;client;I know it’s bad for me. My aunt always says, “You’re just putting another nail in your coffin.” But it’s hard to let go of something that’s been part of my life for so long.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;It’s not easy to change something that’s been such a big part of your routine. What do you think it would take for you to feel ready to quit?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;25;client;I don’t know. Maybe more support or a different approach. I just don’t want to feel worse while I’m trying to quit.;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;That’s completely understandable. Let’s explore some options together and find something that works for you. How does that sound?;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Yeah, I’d like that.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;0;Therapist;Hi there. I understand that last Friday, you were stopped on Stadium Road and cited for driving under the influence. The report also mentions you were transported to detox. How are you feeling about all of this?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;1;Client;Uh, I guess it’s accurate. I don’t really remember much, though. I was pretty drunk, and it’s all kind of a blur.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;2;Therapist;That sounds like it must have been a stressful experience. What’s been on your mind since it happened?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;3;Client;I don’t know. I mean, it’s not like I’m a heavy drinker or anything. I just had a few beers with friends. It’s not a big deal.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;4;Therapist;It sounds like you don’t see this as a major issue, but I’m curious—what do you think the university or the law might see as the bigger picture here?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;5;Client;I guess they’re worried about safety or whatever. But I didn’t hurt anyone, and I made it home fine.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;6;Therapist;I hear you. You didn’t hurt anyone, and that’s a good thing. But what do you think might have happened if things had gone differently?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;7;Client;I mean… I guess it could’ve been worse. Like, if I’d crashed or something. But I didn’t, so…;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;8;Therapist;It’s good that you’re aware of that possibility. How do you feel about the fact that you were in a situation where that could’ve happened?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;9;Client;I don’t know. I guess I didn’t really think about it at the time. I just wanted to get home.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;10;Therapist;That makes sense. Sometimes in the moment, it’s hard to think things through. What do you think might help you make different choices in the future?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;11;Client;I don’t know. Maybe just not drinking as much, or calling a ride sooner. But it’s not like I do this all the time.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;12;Therapist;It sounds like you’re already thinking about some ways to avoid this kind of situation again. That’s a great start. How important is it to you to make sure something like this doesn’t happen again?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;13;Client;I mean, I don’t want to get in trouble or anything. And I definitely don’t want to hurt anyone. So, I guess it’s pretty important.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;14;Therapist;That’s really thoughtful of you. It sounds like you care about your safety and the safety of others. What do you think might be the first step toward making sure this doesn’t happen again?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;15;Client;Maybe just being more careful about how much I drink, or making sure I have a plan to get home before I go out.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;16;Therapist;Those are great ideas. It sounds like you’re already starting to take responsibility for your actions. How do you feel about the university’s expectations around this situation?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;17;Client;I get that they have rules and all, but it feels like they’re making a big deal out of it. I mean, I’m not the only one who’s done something like this.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;18;Therapist;I understand it might feel that way. But the university’s goal is to help students stay safe and successful. How do you think you can work with them to show you’re taking this seriously?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;19;Client;I guess I can go to that alcohol seminar thing they’re making me do. And maybe just be more careful in the future.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;20;Therapist;That sounds like a good plan. It shows you’re willing to take steps to learn and grow from this. How do you feel about the financial part of the seminar?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;21;Client;I mean, $150 is a lot, but I guess it’s better than getting suspended or something worse.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;22;Therapist;That’s a really mature way to look at it. It sounds like you’re starting to see the bigger picture. How do you feel about where things stand now?;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;23;Client;I guess I’m okay with it. I mean, I don’t like it, but I get why it’s happening. And I’ll do what I need to do to move past it.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;24;Therapist;That’s a really positive attitude. It takes a lot of courage to reflect on something like this and take steps to improve. I’m here to support you if you need anything along the way.;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;25;Client;Thanks. I appreciate that.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Hi, David. How are you feeling today?;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Hmm, pretty good.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;That’s great to hear. I wanted to check in with you about something I noticed during your rinse—there was quite a bit of staining. Do you have any thoughts about what might be contributing to that?;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;Mm, well, the usual suspects—smoking, wine, coffee. All of the above, I guess.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;It sounds like you’re aware of some of the habits that might be playing a role. Have you ever thought about quitting smoking, or is that something you’re considering right now?;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;Yeah, I’ve thought about it. But honestly, it’s not my cup of tea. I hear it from everybody, and I’ve tried before—it didn’t work. I get it all the time.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;It sounds like you’ve had a lot of people telling you what to do, and that can feel overwhelming. I’m not here to lecture you, David. I’m just curious—what’s your experience with quitting been like in the past?;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;I’ve smoked for 40 years, since I was 14. I quit a couple of times in my 20s, but it’s been pretty consistent since then. I just don’t see myself changing now, no matter what anyone says.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;It sounds like you’ve tried quitting before, and it hasn’t stuck. That can be really frustrating. What do you think made it so hard for you to quit when you tried in the past?;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;I don’t know. It’s just part of my life, I guess. I’ve had open-heart surgery, prostate cancer—you’d think that would’ve been enough to make me quit, but it wasn’t. I just don’t see it happening.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and smoking has been a constant through it all. I hear you saying that right now, quitting doesn’t feel like something you’re ready to tackle. Is that right?;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;Yeah, that’s about it. I know it’s not great for me, but I just don’t see myself quitting anytime soon.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;And that’s okay, David. This is your journey, and you get to decide what’s right for you. I’m just here to support you, wherever you’re at. If you ever do decide to make a change, I’d be happy to help.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;I appreciate that. I don’t like lectures, but I’m always open to listening.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;That’s fair. I’ll make sure to keep that in mind. Would it be okay if we check in about this again in the future? No pressure—just to see where you’re at and if there’s anything I can do to support you.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;Yeah, that’s fine. I don’t mind talking about it as long as it’s not a lecture.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;[chuckles] Got it—no lectures. I’ll make sure to keep it conversational. Thanks for being open to talking about it, David. I know it’s not an easy topic.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;Thanks, doc. I appreciate it.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;Of course. And just so you know, wherever you’re at, we’ll work with it. You’re in the driver’s seat here.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;Okay. Sounds good.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;Alright, David. Thanks for taking the time to chat today. Let’s touch base again soon.;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;Thanks, doc. See you next time.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Thank you for coming in today, Nina. I’m really looking forward to getting to know you and hearing more about what brought you here.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Yeah, my doctor referred me. He said I’ve been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy, especially with the drinking.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;I see. So, your doctor is concerned about your drinking during pregnancy, and now you’re here. How are you feeling about all of this?;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;I’m worried. I don’t want to screw anything up with the baby, but I’m scared I already have.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;It sounds like you really care about your baby and want to give them the best start possible. That’s a really strong motivation. What’s been on your mind since your doctor brought this up?;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;I didn’t even know I was pregnant until about two months in, and I’d already been drinking. I’ve been trying to cut back, but it’s hard, especially when my friends are all still partying.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;That sounds like a tough spot to be in. You’re trying to make changes, but it feels like your friends and your old lifestyle are pulling you back. How do you feel about balancing those two worlds right now?;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;It’s really hard. I don’t want to lose my friends, but I also know I need to step up for the baby. I just feel stuck between who I was and who I need to be.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;It sounds like you’re feeling torn between two identities—the person you’ve been and the person you’re becoming as a mom. That’s a lot to navigate. What do you think it would take to feel more settled in this new role?;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I don’t know. I guess I need to talk to my friends and let them know what’s going on. But I’m scared they won’t understand or that they’ll treat me differently.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;That’s a big step—talking to your friends about this change. What do you think would help you feel more confident having that conversation?;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Maybe if I had some other people in my life who are going through the same thing. Like, other young moms who get it. I feel like I’m the only one in my group who’s dealing with this.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;That makes sense. Having a support system of people who understand what you’re going through could really help. What about your family? Do you feel like they could be a source of support for you?;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;My parents would definitely support me, but I haven’t told them about the drinking. I know they’d be really upset if they found out.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of worry about how others might react. But you also seem really clear about what you need to do for your baby. What’s one small step you could take today to move toward that goal?;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;I think I need to stop drinking completely. I know it’s not good for the baby, and I don’t want to risk anything else.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;That’s a really strong commitment, Nina. It sounds like you’re ready to make this change for your baby. What do you think will help you stay on track, especially when it feels hard?;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I think talking to my friends and being honest with them about why I’m making this change. And maybe finding some other moms who can relate.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;Those are great ideas. It sounds like you’re ready to take some big steps toward this new chapter in your life. How can I support you as you move forward?;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Just knowing it’s not too late to make a difference for the baby is a big help. And maybe we can talk more about how to have those conversations with my friends and family.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Absolutely. We can definitely work on that together. You’re doing such important work, Nina, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. How are you feeling as we wrap up today?;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;I feel a little better, I think. It’s still scary, but I know I have to do this for my baby.;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;That’s a really brave attitude, Nina. Change is hard, but you’re already taking steps in the right direction. Let’s keep working on this together. Thank you for sharing so openly today.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Therapist;Hi, Natalie. I’m Dawn. It’s really nice to meet you. Thanks for coming in today.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;Hi, Dawn. Nice to meet you too. Thanks for having me.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;Of course. I’d love to hear a little more about you and what brought you in today.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;Sure. I’m 28, and I moved to Arizona about six months ago. I love spending time with my family and friends, but work keeps me pretty busy. Lately, I’ve been feeling unhappy with my weight and health, so I thought it’d be good to talk about making some changes.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;It sounds like you’re feeling a bit dissatisfied with where things are at right now, especially with your health and energy levels. What’s been on your mind about this?;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;Yeah, I’ve noticed I feel more sluggish lately, and my mood hasn’t been great. At first, I thought it was just the colder weather, but I think it’s also related to how inactive I’ve been and the foods I’m eating.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;So you’re connecting your energy and mood to your activity and diet. That’s a really important insight. Can you tell me more about times in the past when you felt more active and energized?;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;Definitely. In college, I played sports, and that kept me really active. I had so much energy back then—I could juggle school, sports, and socializing without feeling drained. I think being active made a huge difference.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;It sounds like you were thriving during that time—physically, mentally, and socially. What do you think made it easier to stay active back then compared to now?;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;Well, in college, I had to be active. It was part of my routine—practices, games, and training were non-negotiable. Now, it’s all up to me, and I’m finding it harder to make it a priority.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;That makes sense. When it was built into your schedule, it was easier to stay consistent. Now, it’s more about creating that structure for yourself. What’s been your biggest challenge in staying active these days?;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;I think it’s just finding the motivation after work. I’m so tired by the end of the day, and it’s easier to just unwind with Netflix or something. I know I want to be more active, but actually doing it is the hard part.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;It sounds like you’re caught between wanting to make a change and feeling stuck in your current routine. What do you think would help you take that first step toward being more active?;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;Maybe setting a specific goal, like going to the gym a few times a week or finding an activity I enjoy. I think having a plan would help me stay on track.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;That’s a great idea. Setting small, achievable goals can make a big difference. You also mentioned your mood improves when you’re active. Can you tell me more about how exercise affects your mood?;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Client;Yeah, I definitely feel happier and more positive on days I’m active. Even little things, like sitting in traffic, don’t bother me as much. It’s like I’ve already accomplished something, so the rest of the day feels easier.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;16;Therapist;That’s a powerful connection. It sounds like being active not only boosts your mood but also helps you feel more accomplished and resilient. What about your diet? How do you feel that’s playing a role in how you’re feeling?;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;17;Client;I think my diet isn’t great either. I’ve noticed my clothes fitting tighter, and I’m not as confident about my appearance as I used to be. I think improving my activity and eating habits would help me feel better overall.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;18;Therapist;It sounds like you’re ready to make some changes to feel more like yourself again. What’s one small step you could take this week to move toward your goals?;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;19;Client;I think I’ll start by going for a walk after work a few times this week. It’s simple, but it’s a start.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;20;Therapist;That’s a great plan. Starting small can help build momentum. How do you feel about taking that step?;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;21;Client;I feel good about it. I know it’s not a huge change, but it’s something I can stick to.;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;22;Therapist;That’s the spirit—small, consistent steps lead to big changes over time. I’m really glad we had this conversation, Natalie. You’ve got a clear vision of what you want, and I’m here to support you every step of the way.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;0;Therapist;Hi, Barbara. I’m Dr. Betty. It’s nice to meet you. What would you like me to call you?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;1;Client;You can call me Barbara. That’s fine.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;2;Therapist;Great, Barbara. I see that you usually see Dr. Brown, but you’re here with me today. What’s brought you in?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;3;Client;I’ve been having a lot of stomach problems, and Dr. Brown hasn’t been able to figure it out. I thought maybe a fresh perspective could help.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;4;Therapist;I’m glad you came in. Can you tell me more about your stomach issues?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;5;Client;It’s been awful. I feel bloated all the time, and I swing between constipation and diarrhea. Sometimes I get cramps or sharp pains, and I’m always running to the bathroom. It’s really affecting my life.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;6;Therapist;That sounds really difficult to deal with. How long has this been going on?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;7;Client;It started about four years ago after a trip to Egypt. I got really sick there, and my stomach hasn’t been the same since.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;8;Therapist;So it’s been a long time. What have you tried so far to manage these symptoms?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;9;Client;Dr. Brown gave me muscle relaxants at first, but they didn’t help much. I’ve also tried herbal remedies from the health shop and Imodium for emergencies. I take different things depending on how I feel each day.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;10;Therapist;It sounds like you’ve been proactive in trying to manage this. Have you had any tests done?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;11;Client;Yes, I had a gastroscopy and a barium enema a few years ago, but they didn’t find anything. Dr. Brown hasn’t suggested any more tests since then.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;12;Therapist;It sounds like you’re frustrated that more hasn’t been done to investigate this. How do you feel about that?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;13;Client;I feel like there must be more tests they could do. I’ve even thought about going private, but I can’t afford it. I just want to know what’s wrong.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;14;Therapist;I hear how much this is affecting you, Barbara. Can you tell me more about how it’s impacting your day-to-day life?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;15;Client;It’s been huge. I had to cut back to part-time work and eventually stopped altogether. I miss my job and my friends. I used to go to exercise classes and out for meals, but I don’t do any of that anymore.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;16;Therapist;It sounds like your life has really changed because of this. What does a typical day look like for you now?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;17;Client;I mostly stay at home, pottering around or watching TV. I’ve gotten hooked on daytime shows. I read a bit, but I’m mostly just at home.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;18;Therapist;That’s quite a shift from how things used to be. Have there been any times when your symptoms improved?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;19;Client;Last year, when my son got married, I was really busy and happy, and my symptoms seemed better. But when my husband’s away for work, it gets worse. I think I worry more then.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;20;Therapist;That’s interesting. It sounds like your symptoms might be connected to how you’re feeling or what’s going on in your life. What do you think about that?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;21;Client;I don’t know. The pain feels so real—it’s hard to believe it’s connected to my mind.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;22;Therapist;I’m not saying the pain isn’t real—it clearly is. But sometimes our emotions and stress can make physical symptoms feel worse. What do you think about exploring that possibility?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;23;Client;I guess it’s worth considering. I just don’t want to miss something serious, like cancer. My mother-in-law died from cancer, and it wasn’t caught in time.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;24;Therapist;I understand your worry, Barbara. It’s clear you’ve been through a lot. What if we tried a different approach? Instead of more tests, we could focus on improving your quality of life and managing stress.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;25;Client;What would that involve?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;26;Therapist;We could work on bringing back some of the activities you enjoy, like meeting friends or gentle exercise. We could also review the medications you’re taking to see what’s helping and what might not be.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;27;Client;That sounds like a big change. How long would we try this for?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;28;Therapist;Let’s give it a few months. I’d see you regularly to monitor your symptoms, and if anything changes, we can investigate further. How does that sound?;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;29;Client;I guess it’s worth a try. I’ll make a list of the medications I’m taking and bring it to our next appointment.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;30;Therapist;That’s a great start, Barbara. Let’s book a double slot for next week so we have plenty of time to talk. I’m looking forward to working with you on this.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;31;Client;Okay, I’ll see you next week.;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;32;Therapist;Great. Take care, Barbara.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi, Sarah, it’s great to meet you. I’m Delwyn, one of the counselors here. I understand you recently had your annual exam, and your nurse practitioner mentioned concerns about smoking and alcohol use. Would you be comfortable sharing a bit more about that?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Yeah, um, last week I met with my nurse, and she seemed worried about how much I’m smoking and drinking. I agreed to work on cutting back on smoking, but I don’t think my drinking is a big deal.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;So, you’re planning to cut back on smoking, but you’re not too concerned about your drinking. Can you tell me more about how you see your drinking?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;I mean, I don’t drink that much—maybe two drinks a day max. It’s just my way to unwind after a long day.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;It sounds like drinking helps you relax and take a break from everything. What does that “me time” look like for you?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Exactly. It’s my time to decompress. I have a two-year-old son, I work full-time as a server, and I’m going back to school. It’s a lot to juggle, and by the end of the day, I just want to relax.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;That sounds like a lot on your plate—being a mom, working, and going to school. And on top of that, you’re on your feet all day at work. It must be exhausting.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Yeah, it is. I’m always worrying—am I making enough money? Can I afford childcare? It’s just overwhelming sometimes.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of stress, and drinking has become a way to cope with that. How do you feel about the amount you’re drinking right now?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I don’t think it’s a problem. Two drinks a day doesn’t seem like much, especially compared to some of my family members who drink way more.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;It sounds like your drinking feels normal to you, especially when you compare it to others. Have you ever thought about how it might be affecting you personally?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I guess I haven’t. I mean, sometimes I feel guilty because I just want to put my son to bed early so I can have that time to myself. But I don’t know—it’s just hard to let go of something that helps me relax.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;It sounds like there’s a bit of a conflict there—wanting to be present for your son but also needing that time to unwind. How does that guilt feel for you?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;It doesn’t feel great. I want to be a good mom, but I also feel like I deserve some time to myself.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;It’s a tough balance, and it sounds like you’re doing your best to manage everything. I’m curious—have you noticed any other ways your drinking might be affecting your life?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Not really. I mean, I don’t think it’s causing problems, but I guess I’ve been drinking a bit more lately because of all the stress.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;So, the more stressed you feel, the more you’re inclined to drink. And it sounds like that’s been increasing over time. How do you feel about that pattern?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I don’t know. I’ve never really thought about it like that. It’s just part of my routine now.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;It sounds like it’s become a way to cope, but it’s also starting to feel a little harder to manage. What do you think about exploring other ways to handle stress that might not involve drinking?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;I’d be open to that. I think if I could find a better way to deal with stress, I wouldn’t feel like I need to drink as much.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;That makes sense. What do you think is the biggest source of stress for you right now?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Probably childcare. My mom usually watches my son, but she’s been less available lately, and it’s been really stressful trying to figure things out.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;So, having more reliable childcare could make a big difference for you. Have you looked into other options, like daycare or community resources?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Not really. I’ve just been relying on my mom, but I know that’s not sustainable.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;It sounds like that’s a key area to focus on. Would you be interested in connecting with one of our social workers? They can help you explore childcare options and other resources to ease some of that stress.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Yeah, that would be really helpful.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;Great. I can set that up for you. In the meantime, how do you feel about setting a small goal around your drinking? Maybe cutting back to one drink a night instead of two?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;I could try that. I don’t know how it’ll go, especially with trying to cut back on smoking too, but I’m willing to give it a shot.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;That’s a great start. Trying it out will help you see what works and what doesn’t. Let’s check in again in a couple of weeks to see how it’s going and how the meeting with the social worker went. Does that sound good?;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks.;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;You’re welcome, Sarah. I’m looking forward to hearing how things go. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;0;Client;Pretty good. It’s been three months now.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;1;Therapist;That’s great to hear! Three months is a significant milestone.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;2;Client;Yeah, it’s been three months since I last used meth.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;3;Therapist;That’s fantastic. How does it feel to have reached this point?;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;4;Client;It feels good. I’ve been doing pretty well overall.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;5;Therapist;That’s wonderful. What’s been helping you stay on track?;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;6;Client;Well, I’ve met a couple of new friends.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;7;Therapist;That’s great! New friends can be such a positive influence. How did you meet them?;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;8;Client;They’re from the neighborhood I’m living in now. It’s been nice to connect with people who aren’t tied to my old habits.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;9;Therapist;That sounds like a really healthy change. Last time we talked, you mentioned cutting ties with your ex-boyfriend, who was also your dealer. How’s that been going?;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;10;Client;It’s been good. I haven’t answered his calls, or calls from some of my other old friends who were part of that lifestyle.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;11;Therapist;That’s a big step. It takes a lot of strength to set those boundaries. How have you been managing the urge to respond when they reach out?;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;12;Client;It’s been tough sometimes, but I’ve been focusing on my new friends and the breathing exercises you taught me.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;13;Therapist;That’s great to hear. How have the breathing exercises been helping?;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;14;Client;They’ve been really helpful. When I start to feel stressed or tempted, I go for a walk and do the breathing exercises. It calms me down and helps me get through those moments.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;15;Therapist;That’s such a positive strategy. It sounds like you’ve found a way to replace old habits with healthier ones. How do you feel when you use those techniques?;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;16;Client;I feel more in control. It’s like I’m taking charge of my emotions instead of letting them take over.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;17;Therapist;That’s such a powerful shift. It sounds like you’ve made some really meaningful changes—new friends, healthier coping strategies, and setting boundaries with people from your past. How do you feel about the progress you’ve made so far?;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;18;Client;I feel proud. It hasn’t been easy, but I’m starting to see the benefits of these changes.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;19;Therapist;You should feel proud. Three months is a huge accomplishment, and it sounds like you’re building a strong foundation for the future. What’s next for you as you keep moving forward?;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;20;Client;I want to keep focusing on my new friendships and maybe explore some new hobbies or activities to stay busy and positive.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;21;Therapist;That sounds like a great plan. Exploring new hobbies can be a fun way to stay engaged and build a fulfilling life. Let me know if you’d like help brainstorming ideas or finding resources to support you.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;22;Client;Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind.;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;23;Therapist;Of course. You’re doing amazing work, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Let’s check in again soon to see how things are going. Sound good?;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;24;Client;Sounds good. Thanks!;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;0;Therapist;Thank you for coming in today. How are you feeling?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;1;Client;I feel great, actually.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;2;Therapist;That’s wonderful to hear. What’s contributing to that feeling?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;3;Client;I’ve been reflecting a lot, and I feel like I’m in a good place right now.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;4;Therapist;That’s great. I know you recently did your value clarification exercise. What were your top five values?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;5;Client;Yes, it was a really eye-opening experience. My number one value was self-respect, which surprised me because I don’t think it’s ever been in my top five before.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;6;Therapist;Really? That’s interesting. Do you have any idea why self-respect has become so important to you now?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;7;Client;I think it’s because I’ve realized how much I’ve neglected myself over the years. I’ve always put others first, almost to the point where I didn’t even consider my own needs. It was a bit of a sad realization, but also empowering because I know it’s never too late to change.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;8;Therapist;That’s such a powerful insight. How does it feel to prioritize yourself now?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;9;Client;It feels liberating. I’ve always thought that putting others first made me a better person, but I’ve realized that neglecting myself only leads to stress, resentment, and burnout. When I respect myself, I’m actually better for others too.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;10;Therapist;That’s such a healthy perspective. It sounds like you’ve been carrying a lot of concern about what others think. How has that influenced your actions in the past?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;11;Client;Completely. I’ve always let what I thought others wanted dictate my actions, rather than listening to my own values. It’s been that way since I was a child, and I didn’t even realize it until recently.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;12;Therapist;That’s a huge realization. How does it feel to finally see that pattern?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;13;Client;It’s like a celebration. I used to dwell on my childhood and all the things I didn’t get, but now I see that I can give myself what I need. I can be my own parent, my own advocate. It’s the first time I’ve said that without feeling guilty.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;14;Therapist;That’s incredible. It’s not selfish to prioritize yourself—it’s necessary. How does this shift make you feel overall?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;15;Client;Jubilant, joyful, and hopeful. I feel like I matter, like I count. I’m excited to pursue what I want with more passion and less dread.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;16;Therapist;That’s such a positive shift. What about your other top values? How do they connect to this new perspective?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;17;Client;My second value is inner harmony. I’ve realized that I need to be at peace with myself before I can truly connect with others. When I’m unhappy, it spills over into my relationships.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;18;Therapist;That makes so much sense. Inner harmony seems like the foundation for everything else. What about family happiness?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;19;Client;Yes, that’s my third value. When I’m at peace with myself, it naturally contributes to my family’s happiness. But when I neglect myself, I end up resentful and quarrelsome.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;20;Therapist;It sounds like self-respect and inner harmony are key to creating a positive environment for yourself and your family. What about your other values?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;21;Client;Health and achievement are also in my top five. Achievement, for me, is about a sense of accomplishment. I want to feel like I’m making a meaningful impact, not just going through the motions.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;22;Therapist;That’s such a fulfilling way to look at it. It’s not just about showing up—it’s about making a real difference. How does that tie into your work as a teacher and counselor?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;23;Client;Exactly. I could just show up and do the bare minimum, but that wouldn’t fulfill me. I want to give something meaningful, even if it’s small.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;24;Therapist;That’s such a beautiful perspective. It’s clear that these values are guiding you toward a healthier, more fulfilling life. Is there anything else that stood out to you during this exercise?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;25;Client;Yes, I was surprised that creativity and freedom didn’t make my top five this time. I realized that self-respect and inner harmony actually give me the freedom and creativity I’ve been seeking. When I’m at peace, the ideas flow naturally.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;26;Therapist;That’s such a profound connection. It sounds like this exercise has been transformative for you. How do you feel about where you are right now?;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;27;Client;I feel like I’m on the right path. It’s been a journey, but I’m finally starting to feel like myself again.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;28;Therapist;That’s amazing to hear. Thank you so much for sharing your insights today. It’s been such a meaningful conversation.;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;29;Client;Thank you for listening. It’s been really helpful to talk through all of this.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Client;I don’t know, I’m just having a lot of trouble trying to lose the rest of the weight. No matter how much I exercise or run, nothing seems to be working.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Therapist;It sounds like you’ve hit a plateau, and despite all your efforts, the scale isn’t moving. That must feel really frustrating.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Client;Yes, exactly. I keep trying, but nothing’s happening. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Therapist;It sounds like you’re putting in a lot of effort, but the results aren’t matching up. How does that make you feel?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Client;It’s discouraging. I’ll go to the gym, work hard, and then come home feeling like it’s all for nothing. And when I try to talk to my mom or dad about it, they don’t seem to care or support me.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Therapist;So, not only are you feeling stuck, but you also feel like you’re doing this all alone?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Client;Yes. It’s like no one understands or wants to help. My dad, especially, he doesn’t support me at all. In fact, he thinks I should be gaining weight back.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Therapist;That sounds really tough. Can you tell me more about what your dad says or how he reacts?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Client;He thinks that by losing weight, I’m trying to disconnect from our family or fit into some “perfect American” image. But that’s not it at all—I just want to be healthy and feel good about my body.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Therapist;It sounds like there’s a disconnect between what you’re trying to achieve and how your family, especially your dad, sees it. How does that affect you?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Client;It’s frustrating because I’m not doing this for anyone else—I’m doing it for me. But it feels like they don’t understand or respect that.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Therapist;That must feel really isolating. It’s hard when the people closest to you don’t seem to support your goals. What do you think is driving your dad’s perspective?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Client;I think it’s cultural. In our family, being bigger is seen as normal, and losing weight is almost like rejecting that. But for me, it’s not about rejecting my family—it’s about taking care of myself.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Therapist;That’s such an important distinction. It sounds like you’re trying to balance your personal health goals with your family’s cultural values. How do you feel about navigating that tension?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Client;It’s hard. I don’t want to feel like I’m turning my back on my family, but I also don’t want to give up on my health.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Therapist;It’s a tough spot to be in. What do you think would help you feel more supported in your journey?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;16;Client;I think just having someone to talk to who understands would help. Maybe someone who’s been through something similar or who can help me stay motivated.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;17;Therapist;That’s a great idea. Have you thought about finding a support group or connecting with others who share your goals?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;18;Client;I haven’t, but that might help. It’s just hard to know where to start.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;19;Therapist;I can help you explore some options if you’d like. In the meantime, how do you feel about the progress you’ve made so far, even if the scale isn’t moving right now?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;20;Client;I guess I have made some progress. I feel stronger and more energetic, even if the weight isn’t coming off.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;21;Therapist;That’s a huge win. Sometimes progress isn’t just about the number on the scale—it’s about how you feel and the habits you’re building. How can you celebrate those wins, even if your family isn’t recognizing them?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;22;Client;I could try to focus more on how I feel and less on what the scale says. Maybe keeping a journal or tracking my energy levels could help me see the bigger picture.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;23;Therapist;That’s a great idea. It’s all about shifting your focus to what’s within your control. How do you feel about setting a small, achievable goal for the next few weeks?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;24;Client;I think that would help. Maybe I could focus on adding more variety to my workouts or trying a new healthy recipe each week.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;25;Therapist;That sounds like a great plan. Small, consistent changes can make a big difference over time. And remember, you’re not alone in this—I’m here to support you, and we can work on finding other sources of support too.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;26;Client;Thanks. That means a lot.;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;27;Therapist;You’re welcome. Let’s check in next time and see how things are going. Sound good?;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;28;Client;Sounds good.;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;Therapist;Thank you for coming in today, Tanya. What’s one thing in your life you’d like to change, even if it feels a bit uncertain or challenging?;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;Client;Well, I’ve been struggling with this big test I need to take. I keep putting it off because I get so anxious. I don’t trust myself to do well, and it’s been weighing on me for years.;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;Therapist;It sounds like this test has become a huge source of anxiety for you. What makes it feel so overwhelming?;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;Client;I just don’t believe in myself. I’m scared I’ll fail, and then I’ll have to face everyone’s questions or judgments. It’s easier to avoid it altogether.;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;Therapist;So, the fear of failing and how others might react is holding you back. On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you can manage your anxiety and take this test?;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;Client;Maybe a four or five. I’ve actually scheduled it this time, which is a step forward, but I’m still really nervous.;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;Therapist;That’s progress! What’s different this time that made you decide to schedule it instead of avoiding it completely?;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;Client;I’m just tired of thinking about it every day. If I don’t pass, I’ll have to wait three months to retake it, but at least I’ll know where I stand. I just want this weight off my shoulders.;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;Therapist;It sounds like you’re focusing on the relief you’ll feel once it’s over, no matter the outcome. That’s a powerful motivator. Have there been times in the past when you faced something anxiety-provoking and it turned out well?;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;Client;Yeah, a few years ago, I had to do a recording for work. I was so anxious and didn’t think I’d do well, but it ended up being one of my best performances. My supervisor was really impressed, and it felt good to prove myself wrong.;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;Therapist;That’s amazing! It sounds like that experience not only boosted your confidence but also showed you that your anxiety doesn’t define your abilities. How do you think that experience relates to this test?;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;Client;I guess it’s the same kind of anxiety, but if I can push through and do well, I’ll feel that same pride and relief. I just need to remind myself that I’ve done it before and I can do it again.;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;Therapist;That’s a great mindset. What would help you move from a four or five to a seven or eight in confidence before the test?;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;Client;Practicing more and focusing on positive self-talk. Instead of telling myself I’ll fail, I need to remind myself that I’ve succeeded before and I can do it again.;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;Therapist;That’s a great plan. It sounds like you’re ready to take this step, even with the anxiety. You’ve already shown courage by scheduling the test and reflecting on your past successes. How do you feel about moving forward?;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;Client;I feel a little more hopeful. I know it’s not going to be easy, but I’m ready to face it and see what happens.;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;Therapist;That’s a great attitude, Tanya. Remember, progress is progress, no matter how small. I’m here to support you along the way. Thank you for sharing so openly today.;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;Client;Thank you. I feel a bit better just talking about it.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi, Andrea. Thanks for coming in today. I usually meet with students once or twice a semester to talk about life, goals, and behaviors. How are you doing?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;I’m good, thanks.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Great. Let’s start by you telling me a little about yourself.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Sure. My name’s Andrea. I’m in the marching band—I play the tenor sax. I’m also in jazz band and wind ensemble. I’m an IB student too.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;That’s impressive! How long have you been playing the sax?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;About four years, but I’ve been involved in music for about 10 years total. I started with the violin, then clarinet, and finally found my way to the sax.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Wow, that’s a lot of experience. How do you like marching band?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;It’s fun but a lot of work. I love the group setting and working with my classmates. Competitions are really exciting.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;That sounds rewarding. Do you have friends in band, or do you hang out with others outside of band?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I have two groups—friends from class and friends from band.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;Got it. Tell me a little about your family.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I have an older brother who’s nine years older than me, my parents, and our golden retriever, Charlie. He’s eight.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;Sounds like a great family. What are your plans after high school?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I want to go to college and become a doctor—maybe in psychology or psychiatry.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;That’s an amazing goal. Have you thought about specific schools or majors?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Not too much yet. I’m thinking psychology, but I haven’t narrowed it down.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;That’s okay—you’ve got time. How are your grades?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;They’re pretty good—high three-point something.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;That’s great. What do you like to do for fun on weekends?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Usually hang out with friends—movies or just chilling at someone’s house.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;When you’re hanging out, is there ever alcohol involved?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Sometimes, yeah. I’ll be honest—it depends on how much schoolwork I have. If there’s less, it might be every other weekend or three weekends a month.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;How much do you usually drink when you do?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Not enough to get blackout drunk—just a little tipsy. I’ve gotten blackout drunk once, but I didn’t like it, so I avoid that now.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Got it. How much do your friends drink?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;About the same—one or two drinks, but sometimes more.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;Andrea, based on what you’ve shared, your drinking puts you in a high-risk group. Have you thought about the risks?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Not really. I figured since we’re in a small group and usually sleep over, we avoid things like drinking and driving or unsafe situations.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;That’s good, but there are still risks like health problems, accidents, or even developing alcoholism. How do you feel about that?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;I haven’t thought much about it, but it’s a little concerning now that you mention it.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;I’m glad you’re open to discussing it. What would it take for you to cut back or stop drinking?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;I think I could stop. I don’t need it—it’s more about the social aspect. But it might be hard if my friends are still drinking.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;That’s a valid concern. How do you think your close friends would react if you decided not to drink?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;My close friends would probably be supportive, but the ones I’m not as close with might judge me.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;It sounds like your close friends are the ones who matter most. How about focusing on spending more time with them and less with the others?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;That makes sense. I could try that.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;Great. Let’s set a goal for you to stop drinking, starting this weekend. How does that sound?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;I think I can do it, especially if I focus on band and my close friends.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;That’s a great plan. What will you say if someone asks why you’re not drinking?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;I could say I’m focusing on school and my health, and I don’t want to risk my future.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;Perfect. You could even encourage them to cut back too. How do you feel about this plan?;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;I feel good about it. It’s a step in the right direction.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;I’m proud of you for taking this seriously. Let’s check in again in a couple of weeks to see how it’s going.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;Sounds good. Thanks for your help.;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;You’re welcome, Andrea. I’m here to support you. Take care!;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;0;Therapist;Hi, Mary. How was your day?;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;1;Client;Fine. Where do you want me to sign?;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;2;Therapist;Right here, please. It seems like you’re not in the mood to talk today.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;3;Client;Not really.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;4;Therapist;That’s okay. I noticed you missed your first-hour class today. Is everything okay?;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;5;Client;Yeah, whatever. It’s just the same thing every day. I don’t see the point.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;6;Therapist;It sounds like you’re feeling frustrated. Can I explain again why I’m here and what this program is about?;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;7;Client;I guess.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;8;Therapist;My role is to check in daily, make sure you’re here, and ensure your GPS is charged. I also want to get to know you better and support you.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;9;Client;So you just want to know my business?;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;10;Therapist;I can see how it might feel that way. My goal is to help you succeed and get off this program as quickly as possible.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;11;Client;I’ll be here if I have to, but I can’t promise I won’t leave.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;12;Therapist;It sounds like you’re still unsure about sticking to the program. What’s making it hard for you?;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;13;Client;It’s just a lot. All these rules and people checking on me. I don’t get why you care.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;14;Therapist;I understand it feels overwhelming. You’ve got the courts, your mom, and me all involved. It’s a lot to handle.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;15;Client;Yeah, it’s too much.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;16;Therapist;I hear you. Some clients have told me they didn’t realize how much they valued their freedom until it was gone. Is that how you feel?;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;17;Client;Yeah, I just want my freedom back.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;18;Therapist;What do you think would help you get your freedom back?;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;19;Client;Signing your papers, I guess. And not doing anything to end up back in this situation.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;20;Therapist;That’s a good start. Signing the papers, even though it’s annoying, is a step toward your goal. What else could help?;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;21;Client;Not doing anything stupid so I don’t have to deal with this again.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;22;Therapist;That’s a great mindset. Avoiding those choices will help you stay free. I appreciate you signing the paperwork, even when it’s frustrating.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;23;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;24;Therapist;Before I go, is there anything else you’d like to share or ask?;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;25;Client;Not really.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;26;Therapist;Okay. I’ll be back later today. Take care, Mary.;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;27;Client;Bye.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Jacob, your physical exam looks great. Do you have any questions for me?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;No.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Okay. I see you filled out the alcohol and drug questionnaire. Can we go through it together?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Sure.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Just so you know, everything we discuss is confidential. I’ll only share with your parents if you give permission or if there’s a safety concern. Does that make sense?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Yeah.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Great. I see you marked that you sometimes use alcohol to relax, feel better, or fit in. Can you tell me more about that?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;It’s not a big deal. Sometimes I drink with friends—beers or rum and cokes at parties.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;How much do you usually drink at a time?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Maybe three or four drinks. I don’t really keep track.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;And how often does this happen?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;About once or twice a month.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;How long have you been drinking like this?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Since last October, so about six months.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;What do you like about drinking?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;It’s fun hanging out with friends, especially at parties. I like the taste too.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;So it helps you relax and have fun. Are there any parts of drinking you don’t like?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I hate the hangovers—feeling sick and throwing up the next morning.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;Have you ever had a blackout, where you couldn’t remember what happened?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;No, but I know someone who has.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Have you had any problems because of drinking, like at school or home?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;I missed first period once because of a hangover. My mom got mad and grounded me for two weeks.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;That sounds tough. Have you told your mom about your drinking?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;No, but she figured it out when I couldn’t get out of bed that morning.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;So drinking has caused some issues, like missing school and getting in trouble at home.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Yeah, but it’s only happened once.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;I see you marked that you haven’t ridden with someone who was drinking or driven after drinking. That’s great. I hope you keep avoiding those situations.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Yeah, I will.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;As your doctor, I’m concerned about your drinking. Teens’ brains are still developing, and alcohol can harm that. I recommend not drinking at all.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Okay.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;On a scale of 0 to 10, how ready are you to stop drinking? 0 means not ready at all, and 10 means very ready.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;Probably a five.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;Why didn’t you pick a lower number, like a two or three?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;I’m tired of getting in trouble.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;What could you do to avoid trouble?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;Not drink.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;Have you ever tried stopping?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Not really.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;Some people your age try stopping for a while to see how it feels. Could you try that?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;Yeah, I could.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;How long do you think you could go without drinking?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;Maybe two months.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;What would make it easier for you to stop drinking?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;I could drink something else, like coke, when my friends are drinking. Or hang out with friends who don’t drink.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;That’s a great plan. Do you have anyone who could support you in this?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;My friends who don’t drink would probably be happy and supportive.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;You’ve come up with good reasons to stop—like avoiding hangovers and trouble—and solid strategies, like spending time with non-drinking friends. I’m proud of you for considering this. How about we schedule a follow-up in two months to see how it’s going?;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;Okay.;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;Great. I’ll see you then. Take care, Jacob.;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;0;therapist;All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to hear what you've been thinking about over the week since our last session. What’s been on your mind?;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;1;client;Mm, I’ve been thinking a lot about why I’m here and what I want to achieve. I feel a bit clearer about it now.;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;2;therapist;That’s great to hear. What’s shifted for you since last time?;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;3;client;I’ve realized how much my gambling is affecting my life, especially financially. It’s been a wake-up call.;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;4;therapist;That sounds like an important realization. How does it feel to acknowledge that?;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;5;client;It’s tough, but I know I need to do something about it. I can’t keep going like this.;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;6;therapist;It sounds like you’re ready to make some changes. What’s one small step you think you could take to start addressing this?;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;7;client;I think I need to set a budget and stick to it. Maybe even cut up my credit cards.;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;8;therapist;That’s a concrete step. What do you think might get in the way of doing that?;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;9;client;Probably my friends. We always go out, and it’s hard to say no when they’re all gambling.;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;10;therapist;That’s a real challenge. How do you think you could handle those situations differently?;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;11;client;I guess I’d have to be honest with them and explain why I’m cutting back. It won’t be easy, though.;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;12;therapist;It’s definitely not easy, but it sounds like you’re committed to making a change. How can I support you in this?;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;13;client;Maybe we could talk about strategies for saying no or finding other ways to spend time with them.;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;14;therapist;That’s a great idea. Let’s explore some strategies together. How does that sound?;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;15;client;Yeah, that would help. I feel like I’m ready to take this seriously.;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;16;therapist;That’s fantastic to hear. Let’s work on a plan to help you move forward.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;client;So, uh, I guess the issue is that, um, you know, my doctor seems to think that my-my blood pressure's a little high, but I really don't think that there's a problem. And you know, I eat really well. Um. And, you know, she suggested that, um, I watch my caffeine but really, caffeine is not a problem for me.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;therapist;Okay. Um, but we were talking a little bit earlier-- earlier in our conversation, you had said that you did feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation. So it's a little bit of, I'm not sure of what-- Um, so where are we? Did-did you-- do you feel like you do have some agitation out of coffee, or is it just no problem at all?;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;client;Well, you know, sometimes it makes me a little jittery and, you know, I have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of my co-workers, but-- And-and working, um, in the hospital, they don't really look so highly on-on going the bathroom frequently. But you know, it-it keeps me awake, it keeps me aware, it-it makes me more able to like, you know, do my job better. And so I really don't see that it's a-it's a real issue.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;therapist;Yeah.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;client;Um, you know, and-and-- I mean, maybe my blood pressure is a little high, but—;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;therapist;Yeah. So let me see if I had this. So y- so you got some positives, the-the awareness, and then you feel kinda on your game?;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;client;Mm-hmm.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;therapist;Um, and then there's some negatives with, um, you know, your-your co-workers, um, that they don't, you know-- then your boss may not want you, you know, checking out-;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;client;Right.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;therapist;-on the hospital floor, you know, for frequently.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;client;Gotta stay on, yeah.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;therapist;Yeah, yeah, and then the blood pressure thing. Does that sound about right?;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;client;Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and sometimes, like I said, it does kind of make me a little jittery and, um, I don't know. I-I-I'm not- I'm not as happy and relaxed as I normally am. But you know, I-I really like it, and-and like I said, it makes me more aware of what's going on and-and I'm-- I-I feel like I'm much more observant.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;therapist;Yeah. How about frequency? Do you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking?;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;client;Yeah. I have about four cups a day.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;therapist;Okay. Okay. And that feels about right to you?;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;client;Yeah. I mean, I've-- I mean, it's the co-workers that-that work at night. Gosh, they bring in a carafe.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;client;And, uh, I-I can only imagine-;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;therapist;Yeah.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;client;What-What their bodies are like.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;therapist;Yeah, yeah. What would happen if you-- if you looked at, maybe reducing that with that habit? Would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic?;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;client;Reducing it, like-- what do you mean?;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;therapist;The number. Just the number.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;client;Yeah, yeah but, I mean, how-how much are we talking?;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;therapist;I don't-- you tell me. I mean, um, you're-you're drinking four a day.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;client;Mm-hmm.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;therapist;Um--;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;client;You're probably-- you know, because I-I gotta have that morning cup, I really-- you know I really like waking up and-and that whole ritual. The, um-- you know, making the coffee and-;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;therapist;Yeah.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;client;I just really like the flavors.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;therapist;Yeah.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;client;So I-I definitely don't want to give that up, but—;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;therapist;I gotcha. Okay.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;client;Uh—;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;therapist;So that one's important.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;client;Mm-hmm.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;therapist;Yeah.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;client;And then, of course, you know, working a 12-hour shift, I-I really think that, you know, the afternoon to keep me going until the evening is-is a really good idea too.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;therapist;Yeah.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;client;I could probably get up the mid-morning.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;41;therapist;I think that's great.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;client;Yeah, yeah, yeah.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;43;therapist;I think so. So you've identified one of the four that might-- you might be willing to-to try-;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;44;client;Mm-hmm.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;therapist;-for a while to-to let go of. What do you- What do you think of that?;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;46;client;I think that does sound all right.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;47;therapist;Okay.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;48;client;Yeah.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;49;therapist;Good.;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;50;client;I think I could do that.;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Tell me what you know about the flu shot?;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Uh, well, I know the flu can be pretty bad, but I'm in pretty good health, so I don't really feel like I need it. Uh, it's kind of just more for old people, right?;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Mm, um, so you're thinking it's really just for people who are-are vulnerable to illness?;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Yeah.;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Would it be okay if I shared a little more information with you about the flu vaccine and the importance of it?;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Okay.;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;So you're right that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean that you would probably do okay if you got the flu. But we do know that the elderly are more at risk, pregnant people, babies are at risk of having serious complications from the flu, and by you getting the vaccine, that helps prevent you from passing it on to other people.;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Okay.;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;So having shared that information with you, how do you feel about the idea of the flu vaccine?;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Well, my grandparents probably wouldn't handle the flu very well-;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Mm.;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;and my co-worker is pregnant too.;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;So-so, yeah, I guess, I should, uh, get it for their sake.;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;Okay, so you've got some people in your life who are vulnerable to possible illness, and making this decision to get the flu shot will help protect them.;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;Yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, Laura. So, thanks for coming in. I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about. So, basically, I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester. And we're going to talk about, you know, whatever's kind of going on in your life. I'll ask you some questions about, you know, your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things. And then we'll talk a little bit about, you know, different behaviors and-and stuff like that. And so, it's-it's pretty casual, pretty informal, just sort of a chance for me to get to know you if that's all right.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Okay. Why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Okay. Um, my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay. And what do you like to do for fun?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Um, mostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends, things like that.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Mm-hmm, and when you and your friends are hanging out, and what- what do you do? Do you go to football games, go to parties?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Uh, yeah, if it's school-related, maybe like a game or two, or go to the mall, like, to shop or go to the movies or something, and at night, maybe like a party or something if someone's throwing.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. And what kind of hobbies do you have?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, I like to read and I like to go outside and, like, take walks and, like, hike and stuff. I'm very outdoorsy, so-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Oh, cool. What are your plans for after high school?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Well, I plan to apply to college and maybe, you know, have a good career and something like that, hopefully.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;That's great. What do you think you'll study?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Well, I'm-I'm looking at the journalism, maybe pre-law.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Oh, neat.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;-which is a little different, but-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Yeah, that's great. That's a really good goal.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah. Thanks.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;It's, uh, hard work to get into law school. Are you doing well in school? What kind of grades do you get?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm getting mostly A's and B's, so I'm pretty good, I'm okay.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Okay. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Um, I think all my grades are A's and B's, so, yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Okay. And do you know where you're going to apply to college?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Um, I'm not sure yet, but I'm looking into schools like in the area, so maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll leave home or something.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay. Cool. And, you know, what made you decide maybe law school or-or journalism?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Um, well, I'm definitely not a math or science person, so I started off by there that I started looking at careers that maybe I would like. So-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay. Great. Sounds like you have, like I said, really good goals and you're working hard in school. Um, you said that when you're going out with your friends, you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties, so do you drink alcohol?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Um, not really. Maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Okay. And how often do you think you drink?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Um, maybe like once or twice a month at the most.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Mm-hmm, so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Okay, and so that's maybe like 20 times a year.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Possibly, yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Yeah, I guess you can say that.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay. What do you think is the most you've ever had?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Um, just two drinks at a party at the most. I don't-- I don't like to drink a lot. I don't-- Getting drunk is not something that appeals to me. So, I just have, like, a drink in my hand, so my friends won't bug me about not drinking. It's just like to look like I'm actually doing something. Most of- a lot of the time, I don't even drink at all. So-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;But you've been drunk before?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Um, no, not really, maybe tipsy, but not like drunk.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;Okay. Um, so the most you've ever, ever had is two drinks in a day.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Okay. Interesting. So, do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, yeah, yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Okay. Um, so one of the things that, you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. So, um, you know, that's actually a really big problem. And even around here, we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident. So that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing, all right? Have you ever done that? Have you ever gotten in the car-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;No, I have drunk-driven and never got in a car with a drunk driver.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Okay. Uh, how much do your friends drink?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Um, I mean, I have some friends that drink some more than others, like, my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that, but I know that there are people that drink a lot more.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Okay. What about at these parties you're going to, are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Yeah. There are kids that drink a lot more than I do. Definitely, yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;And do you hang out with them?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Not really closely, like, I know who they are and I'll say hi, but not-- They're not really, like, close friends of mine.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Mm-hmm, so, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Um, yeah. That makes sense.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Yeah, so, there, I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, people, um, you know, will fall or, um, you know, break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and falling down or, you know, as a girl, it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;You know, especially if you've been drinking, then, you know, you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you. Did- have you thought about that?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah, yeah, I have. That's, uh, one of the main reasons that I don't like to drink that much.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;So-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;And then, um, you know, people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too. Um, also, you know, there have been a lot of kids, even at this school, who've gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;And then their parents find out or the school finds out and, you know, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol, and really can get you into trouble, and it could put your whole college career in jeopardy. Have you thought about that?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Yeah. Definitely, yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;But you're still drinking.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Um, yeah, I mean, I guess it's the thing to do at a party, so-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Uh-huh. So, I mean, do you think it's the thing to do if you wanna be an attorney?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Um, definitely not. That's why I don't try to drink that much. Just-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;-make it look like I am, kind of.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm. So, I mean, I guess what we need to do then is kinda talk about some goals for how to be-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;Okay.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;safer.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;Okay.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;Um, obviously, you shouldn't be drinking at all. Um, what do you think about that?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;I definitely agree. I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol, they are the ones you mentioned, like, health-wise and things like that, so, I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, do you think you can quit?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Um, yeah, I mean, it's not, like, a really big part of my life, so.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;Okay. So, I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;Okay.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;And, um, that's gonna be your goal, and that's great, you know, that's really why we're here, is to talk about that and-and make sure that you come to that decision. Um, so, I guess, can you quit this weekend then?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;Yeah, yeah, definitely. I'll just not have a drink.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Okay, and then what about your friends who are still drinking?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;Um, I really can't control what they do, but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;Okay, and-and what if they won't?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Well, then, I guess, I'll just try to hang around them less or something. I'll try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party or anything.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Yeah. Probably if your friends won't quit drinking, you should just find new friends.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Okay.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;'Cause, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure you into drinking and then you're gonna feel awkward and, you know, you're gonna be stuck and-and not know what to do and really you'd just be better off probably without them. If they're- if they're the kind of people who are gonna keep drinking-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;Yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;-they're probably not a good influence.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;Okay, yeah.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;Um, and then, then you'll be better set for college too because, you know, the issue is you're getting good grades now, but when you get to college, it's a lot harder and, you know, if you're needing really good grades to get into law school, which you will need, then you really can't be distracted by alcohol.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;Okay, yeah, definitely.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;Okay, so, um, that's great 'cause it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you. Um, let's see. I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;They would be pretty upset. Yeah. They don't really condone alcohol use.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;So-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;Okay, so, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. I-- Okay, so, like I said, I'm gonna right down here that you've decided to quit and, um, uh, you know, I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably in the next semester sometime, so we can kinda check-in and-and make sure that, you know, that's still going well-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;Okay.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;-and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking. Um, is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Um, no, no. I think I'm good.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Okay. Um, any questions or anything-;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;Uh, no.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;like that?;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;I have no questions.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;Okay. You're sure? Okay. All right. Um, well, that's probably it then. You can, uh, head back to class and-and thanks for coming in.;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;Okay, thanks.;;;
54;high;managing life;0;therapist;Oh, hello Scott.;;;
54;high;managing life;1;client;Hi.;;;
54;high;managing life;2;therapist;Um, we were talking a little bit earlier, and you said you wanted to talk about exercising.;;;
54;high;managing life;3;client;I do.;;;
54;high;managing life;4;therapist;What's going on with that?;;;
54;high;managing life;5;client;Well, I just can't seem to get back in the gym. I don't wanna-- I-I used to work out quite a bit, and in the last, I dunno, couple of years I've just-- I stopped going. I got busy, and now I'm out of the habit, and I-I really, I dunno, I feel like I need to get back.;;;
54;high;managing life;6;therapist;Well, I mean, I think you just need to maybe sit down and write down a list of reasons why you need to get back to the gym, and then on the other side of the list, put down, you know, um, ideas about what's going to help you get there.;;;
54;high;managing life;7;client;Okay. Um. All right. Um—;;;
54;high;managing life;8;therapist;What gym do you belong to?;;;
54;high;managing life;9;client;Uh, I belong to the-the Sport Fitness Center.;;;
54;high;managing life;10;therapist;Okay. And-and how far away is it from your house?;;;
54;high;managing life;11;client;Just a couple of miles.;;;
54;high;managing life;12;therapist;Just a couple of miles. Mm. So you-- you know, you could, like, ride your bike or walk there, and it would be [unintelligible 00:01:12] too.;;;
54;high;managing life;13;client;If I walked that far, I probably wouldn't even need to go to the gym, right?;;;
54;high;managing life;14;therapist;Well, I don't know about that. Um. That-- you know, it's really important that you get your, um, not just your cardiovascular-- that's a good idea for the cardiovascular, but also, you know, your, um, weightlifting, the [inaudible 00:01:32] [crosstalk];;;
54;high;managing life;15;client;[inaudible 00:01:33] training.;;;
54;high;managing life;16;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;;;
54;high;managing life;17;client;It-it-it would be important.;;;
54;high;managing life;18;therapist;Yeah. So why-why do you want to-- what do you wanna do with that? You want to look different, or--?;;;
54;high;managing life;19;client;Well, I-I-I-I would feel better. My-- I'd-I'd be able to wear more my clothes. I've been growing around the middle and I'd like to, uh, you know, go back to where I was, you know, get into a 34, 36 waist, you know.;;;
54;high;managing life;20;therapist;Okay.;;;
54;high;managing life;21;client;I-I'm more comfortable-- I feel better. I think that's the main thing.;;;
54;high;managing life;22;therapist;Okay. Yeah, because your-your health really, to me, it's more important than your-your looks. I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand what you're saying, but, you know, it'd be great to get back in those jeans, but—;;;
54;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah, yeah. It-it-it-- I-I am- I'm not getting any younger than I [unintelligible 00:02:18];;;
54;high;managing life;24;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, I think you know what to do. You've done it before.;;;
54;high;managing life;25;client;Yeah.;;;
54;high;managing life;26;therapist;Yeah. Just a matter-- You just gotta do it.;;;
54;high;managing life;27;client;I've gotta make time.;;;
54;high;managing life;28;therapist;Yeah.;;;
54;high;managing life;29;client;I've gotta make time.;;;
54;high;managing life;30;therapist;Yeah. And so that might mean, you know, like giving up an hour's sleep, getting up an hour earlier in the day, and going there and getting it done then. That's what I do.;;;
54;high;managing life;31;client;Yeah. Okay.;;;
54;high;managing life;32;therapist;Yeah.;;;
54;high;managing life;33;client;All right.;;;
54;high;managing life;34;therapist;So when I see you next time, you know, that's what I'd like you to do is to, uh, experiment with getting up an hour earlier and, um-- You know, 'cause, uh, getting healthier is more important than sleep, you know. I mean, I know sleep is important, but-- And then bring that list back that we talked about.;;;
54;high;managing life;35;client;Okay.;;;
54;high;managing life;36;therapist;Okay?;;;
54;high;managing life;37;client;Okay.;;;
54;high;managing life;38;therapist;All right, so I'll see you next week.;;;
54;high;managing life;39;client;Okay. Very good. Thanks.;;;
54;high;managing life;40;therapist;All right. All right. Bye.;;;
56;high;managing life;0;Therapist;Hi, Mrs. Smith. I’m Denise, one of the social workers here at the clinic. I work closely with Dr. Fields and the team to support people in situations like yours—especially those transitioning back home after rehab. How has it been since you returned home?;;;
56;high;managing life;1;Client;It’s been pretty good, overall.;;;
56;high;managing life;2;Therapist;That’s great to hear! What’s been the best part about being back home?;;;
56;high;managing life;3;Client;Oh, I’m so glad to see my dog again—he’s such a sweetheart. And my garden is coming along nicely. It just feels good to be home.;;;
56;high;managing life;4;Therapist;That sounds wonderful. Being back in your own space, surrounded by what you love, must feel really rewarding. I know getting home was a big goal for you. How have you been managing with your physical therapy and Tai Chi?;;;
56;high;managing life;5;Client;Well… I didn’t go this week.;;;
56;high;managing life;6;Therapist;Oh? What happened that led you to skip them?;;;
56;high;managing life;7;Client;I had a bit of a scare—I didn’t fully fall, but I lost my balance. It made me think maybe I’m pushing myself too hard.;;;
56;high;managing life;8;Therapist;That sounds really unsettling. It’s understandable to feel cautious after something like that. You’ve been working so hard to get home and stay active—it’s a lot to manage. What’s been going through your mind since that happened?;;;
56;high;managing life;9;Client;I’m worried I might fall again. If I hurt myself, I might not be able to stay home anymore. That’s the last thing I want.;;;
56;high;managing life;10;Therapist;It sounds like staying home is really important to you, and you’re trying to figure out how to balance staying safe with staying active. What do you think might help you feel more secure?;;;
56;high;managing life;11;Client;I don’t know… maybe cutting back on Tai Chi? It feels like it’s too much right now.;;;
56;high;managing life;12;Therapist;That’s a valid concern. Tai Chi can be demanding, and it’s okay to reassess what feels right for you. Do you remember what Dr. Fields said about Tai Chi and its benefits for preventing falls?;;;
56;high;managing life;13;Client;She did mention that it helps with balance and preventing falls. But after what happened, I’m not so sure it’s for me.;;;
56;high;managing life;14;Therapist;It’s okay to feel unsure. It sounds like you’re weighing the benefits against how it feels for you personally. What would it take for you to feel safe enough to try it again, even in a modified way?;;;
56;high;managing life;15;Client;I guess if I knew I had some backup—like a way to call for help if something happened. I live alone, and that’s been on my mind a lot.;;;
56;high;managing life;16;Therapist;That’s a really important point. Many people find peace of mind with a personal emergency response system, like a lifeline button. It’s a small device you can wear that connects you to help instantly. Would something like that ease your concerns?;;;
56;high;managing life;17;Client;Yes, that sounds like it could help. I’ve seen those on TV, but I wasn’t sure if they really worked.;;;
56;high;managing life;18;Therapist;They do! And they’re designed to give you that sense of security. What else might help you feel more supported at home?;;;
56;high;managing life;19;Client;Maybe a refresher on home safety tips? And some kind of support system—like a buddy or someone to check in with. My daughter calls, but she lives far away, and I don’t want to burden my neighbors.;;;
56;high;managing life;20;Therapist;Those are great ideas. We can arrange for a caseworker to visit and go over home safety with you. They can also help connect you with local resources or support groups. How does that sound?;;;
56;high;managing life;21;Client;That would be really helpful. I feel like I’ve taken a few steps back lately, and I need to get back on track.;;;
56;high;managing life;22;Therapist;It’s completely normal to feel that way after a setback. You’ve already shown so much strength and determination to get this far. What’s motivating you to keep going?;;;
56;high;managing life;23;Client;My home, my dog, my garden—they mean everything to me. I’ve lived here for decades, and I’m not ready to give it up.;;;
56;high;managing life;24;Therapist;That’s such a powerful motivator. It’s clear how much your home and independence mean to you. Let’s work together to create a plan that helps you stay safe and active while honoring what matters most to you. Does that sound like a good next step?;;;
56;high;managing life;25;Client;Yes, it does. Thank you for listening and helping me figure this out.;;;
56;high;managing life;26;Therapist;Of course! You’re doing such important work, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Let’s get started on those next steps so you can feel more confident and secure at home.;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Hi, Mr. Johnson. I’m here to talk with you about your cholesterol and the medication your doctor prescribed. How are you feeling about everything?;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Honestly, I’m not sure I’m going to take the medicine. I know my cholesterol is high, but I’m worried about the side effects.;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;It sounds like you’re feeling torn. On one hand, you know your cholesterol needs to come down, but on the other, you’re concerned about how the medication might affect you. Can you tell me more about what’s on your mind?;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Yeah, I’m a truck driver, and I haul heavy boxes all day. I can’t afford to have muscle weakness—it would ruin my job.;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;That makes a lot of sense. Your job is physically demanding, and you need to stay strong and healthy to keep doing it. What has your doctor told you about the risks of not treating your high cholesterol?;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;He said I could be at risk for a stroke or heart attack down the line, but that’s not happening right now. The muscle weakness, though—that could happen right away.;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;I hear you. It’s tough to weigh the risks of something that might happen in the future against something that could affect your job right now. Have you talked with your doctor about your concerns with the medication?;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Not really. He just said I need to take it.;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;I see. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit stuck—you want to lower your cholesterol, but you’re worried about how the medication might impact your ability to work. What would help you feel more comfortable about starting the medication?;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;I don’t know. Maybe if I knew for sure that the muscle weakness wouldn’t happen, or if there was a way to manage it if it did.;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;That’s a really good point. The side effect you’re worried about is actually very rare, and if it does happen, it’s usually mild and reversible. Your doctor can monitor you closely and adjust the medication if needed. How does that sound to you?;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;I guess that’s better, but I’m still not sure. What if it happens at a bad time, like when I’m on the road?;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;That’s a valid concern. If you do experience any muscle weakness, it’s important to let your doctor know right away so they can help you manage it. In the meantime, starting the medication could significantly lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack, which could have a much bigger impact on your ability to work and live the way you want to. How do you feel about that trade-off?;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;I mean, I don’t want to have a stroke or anything, but I just don’t want to risk my job either.;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;14;Therapist;It’s clear how much your job means to you, and it’s important to protect that. At the same time, managing your cholesterol is about protecting your long-term health so you can keep doing what you love. What would it take for you to feel ready to give the medication a try?;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;15;Client;I guess if I knew I could stop it if something went wrong, I’d feel better about trying it.;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;16;Therapist;That’s a great plan. You can start the medication, and if you notice any issues, you can let your doctor know right away. They can adjust or switch the medication if needed. How does that sound?;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;17;Client;Yeah, that sounds okay. I’ll give it a try.;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;18;Therapist;That’s a big step, and I’m glad you’re willing to give it a shot. Let’s make sure you have all the information you need, and feel free to reach out if you have any concerns along the way. Does that work for you?;;;
58;low;adhering to medical procedure;19;Client;Yeah, that works. Thanks for listening.;;;
59;low;adhering to medical procedure;20;Therapist;Of course! Your health and your job are both important, and we’re here to support you in finding the right balance. Let’s get you started on the medication, and we’ll take it one step at a time.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;Utterance_Text;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;Therapist;Hi, Mrs. Smith. My name is Terri, and I’m one of the nurses who works with Dr. Fields. How are you doing today?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;Client;I remember you. Yeah, we met once before.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;Therapist;That’s right—last time you were here. I wanted to check in with you about the Tai Chi class Dr. Fields recommended. How did that go?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;Client;Well, I went once.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;Therapist;Uh-huh. What was your experience like?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;Client;It was beautiful to watch, and the instructor was very nice. But I felt really self-conscious because I had to sit in a chair with my walker. I couldn’t do what everyone else was doing.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;Therapist;It sounds like you enjoyed the atmosphere and the instructor, but feeling self-conscious made it hard to fully engage. Is that right?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;Client;Yes, exactly. I felt really out of place.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;Therapist;That’s completely understandable. What were you hoping to achieve by going to Tai Chi?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;Client;Dr. Fields said it could help with my balance. I’m still struggling with the “wobblies,” and I was hoping it would help me feel more stable.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;Therapist;So, you were looking for something to help with your balance, but you didn’t see the results you were hoping for after one session?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;Client;Not yet, no.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;Therapist;That makes sense. It can take time to see progress. What’s your overall goal right now? What are you working toward?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;Client;I want to go home.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;Therapist;Going home is really important to you. What is it about being at home that matters so much?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;Client;Everything. I miss my little dog, my garden, and just being independent—cooking for myself, sleeping and waking up when I want. I miss my life.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;Therapist;It sounds like home represents freedom, comfort, and the things you love. What do you think you need to do to achieve that goal of going home?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;Client;They told me I need to be able to walk down the hallway and back with my walker, without feeling unsteady. I’m not there yet.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;19;Therapist;And do you agree that’s what you need to work on to get home safely?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;20;Client;Yes, I do. I don’t want to fall. I’ve had friends who’ve fallen, and it didn’t end well. So, I agree—but it’s hard.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;21;Therapist;It’s clear that safety is a priority for you. How’s your physical therapy going?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;22;Client;It’s better. It still hurts, but I’m making progress. It’s not as painful as it used to be.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;23;Therapist;That’s great to hear. It sounds like you’re seeing some improvement there. And you were hoping Tai Chi could help with your balance too. Do you think you’d like to give it another try?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;24;Client;[sighs] Yes, I think so. My friend loves it, and I liked the instructor. I just wish I didn’t feel so self-conscious.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;25;Therapist;It’s okay to feel unsure after just one session. It sounds like you’re open to trying again, but the self-consciousness and the logistics of getting there are holding you back. Is that right?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;26;Client;Yes, exactly. Making the arrangements is complicated, and I feel so out of place in the class.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;27;Therapist;Let’s break that down. On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you can make the arrangements to get to Tai Chi again?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;28;Client;Maybe a 5. I know I can do it, but it’s really difficult on my own.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;29;Therapist;What would make it easier for you?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;30;Client;If I had some help—like someone to help me arrange transportation. My daughter could do it, but she can’t visit for at least a week.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;31;Therapist;Would it help if we arranged transportation for you? The rehab center has a van service for patients.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;32;Client;That would be amazing. Yes, please.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;33;Therapist;We can absolutely help with that. What about the self-consciousness? How do you think you could work through that?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;34;Client;I think I just need to remind myself that no one is really looking at me. It’s more in my head.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;35;Therapist;That’s a great insight. It’s normal to feel self-conscious, but you’re there for your own progress. Would it help to talk to the instructor beforehand and let them know how you’re feeling?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;36;Client;Yes, that might help.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;37;Therapist;Great. Let’s make those arrangements for you, and I’ll check in with you after your next session to see how it goes. How does that sound?;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;38;Client;That sounds good. Thank you so much.;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;39;Therapist;You’re welcome, Mrs. Smith. I’m really glad you’re willing to give it another try. You’re making great progress, and I’m here to support you every step of the way.;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;Interlocutor;Utterance_Text;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;Therapist;How are you doing today?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;Client;I’m good, thanks.;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;Therapist;That’s great to hear. Why don’t you fill me in on what’s been going on since I saw you last?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;Client;Um, I guess everything’s fine. I think my caseworker mentioned something about community service that I have to do, but I’m not sure about the details.;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;Therapist;Okay, so it sounds like your caseworker brought it up, but you’re still a little unclear about what’s expected. What do you remember from that conversation?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;Client;I know I have to get it done by the end of my probation, but I don’t remember how many hours or if I’m supposed to find the opportunities myself. I’m kind of confused.;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;Therapist;Got it. So, you know it needs to be done by the end of your probation, but the specifics are a bit fuzzy. Is that right?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;Client;Exactly, yeah.;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;Therapist;Okay. If it’s all right with you, I can go over the details with you to help clarify things. Would that be helpful?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;Client;Yeah, that would be great.;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;Therapist;Perfect. So, you have 25 hours of community service left to complete by the end of your probation. Your case manager is a great resource to help you find a place to do it. Some clients have volunteered at food pantries, shelters, or even the urban ecology center, where you can work outside or with kids. Do any of those options sound like something you might be interested in?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;Client;Yeah, but do I have to find the opportunities myself?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;Therapist;That’s something you can work on with your case manager. She can provide you with options and contact information for places that need volunteers. If you’re feeling stuck, we can also make those calls together. How does that sound?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;Client;Okay, that makes sense. Do you know if I can get all 25 hours done in one weekend?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;Therapist;I can tell you’re eager to get it done, but 25 hours in one weekend might be a lot. Have you thought about breaking it up into smaller chunks? For example, you could do five hours one day, three hours another day, and so on. That way, it feels more manageable. What do you think?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;Client;Yeah, that sounds like a better plan. It would help me keep track of it too.;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;Therapist;Exactly. And since it’s summer break, you could probably finish it in a week if you’re consistent. Do you have any other questions about the community service?;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;Client;I think that’s it. I was mostly worried about finding the opportunities, but it sounds like my case manager can help with that. And I know I need to get the 25 hours done.;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;Therapist;That’s right. And remember, if you have more questions or need support, you can always reach out to me or your case manager. We’re here to help you through this.;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;Client;Okay, thank you.;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;Therapist;You’re welcome. You’re doing great, and I’m confident you’ll get this done. Let’s check in again soon to see how it’s going.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;0;Therapist;So, Tom, this infection has been pretty painful for you, but we have antibiotics. If you take them faithfully for 10 days, I’m confident the infection will clear up. Can you commit to that?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;1;Client;Definitely.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;2;Therapist;Great. Do you mind if we talk about the screening form you filled out earlier today? It mentioned occasional drug use outside of medical reasons. Can you tell me more about that?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;3;Client;Sure. I use meth sometimes.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;4;Therapist;How do you usually take it?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;5;Client;I snort it. Always snort it.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;6;Therapist;Do you ever inject it?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;7;Client;No, never.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;8;Therapist;Do you use any other drugs?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;9;Client;Just alcohol occasionally.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;10;Therapist;How often do you use meth?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;11;Client;About two or three times a month.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;12;Therapist;So, you’re an occasional user—you don’t use very often, and you only snort it. Is that right?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;13;Client;Yeah, that’s right.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;14;Therapist;As you probably know, methamphetamine use comes with some health risks. Even at the level you’re using, it puts you in a category we consider risky. It’s not the same as being addicted, but it’s still concerning. One of the risks is sexually transmitted diseases. Do you think your recent STD might be connected to your meth use?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;15;Client;Yeah, it could be. I was high when I had unprotected sex, and I wouldn’t have done that if I weren’t high.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;16;Therapist;So, normally, you’re careful about using protection?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;17;Client;Definitely.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;18;Therapist;It sounds like methamphetamine might have clouded your judgment in that moment. Has it affected other areas of your life?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;19;Client;Not really. I only use it in clubs with friends, maybe two or three times a month at most. But this STD has me worried. I never expected to get gonorrhea.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;20;Therapist;I can understand why you’d be concerned. I’d actually recommend that you stop using methamphetamine altogether. There are a lot of reasons for this, but that’s my recommendation.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;21;Client;I get that, but it’s hard to think about quitting. My whole social life revolves around it—my friends, the clubs, even my sex life. Everyone there uses it. I’d like to stop, but it’s not easy.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;22;Therapist;It sounds like you recognize the risks of methamphetamine, but it’s also tied to your social and sex life, which makes quitting feel really difficult. Is that right?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;23;Client;Yeah, exactly. I’m not saying I’m not willing to try, but it’s not going to be easy.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;24;Therapist;If you were to rate your readiness to stop using methamphetamine on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is not ready at all and 10 is completely ready, where would you put yourself?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;25;Client;Maybe a 3.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;26;Therapist;Why not a 1 or a 2?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;27;Client;This gonorrhea has been really uncomfortable, and I know I don’t think clearly when I’m high. I could’ve gotten something worse, like HIV. That scares me a lot.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;28;Therapist;That’s a really important insight. Are there any other concerns you have about methamphetamine?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;29;Client;Well, I only snort it, but you never know what it’s cut with. It could be something dangerous. That worries me sometimes.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;30;Therapist;It sounds like you have several reasons to want to stop using methamphetamine—the risk of it being cut with something harmful, the possibility of getting another STD, including HIV. What do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;31;Client;I’d need something else to do on weekends—a different social life.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;32;Therapist;How could you build a different social life?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;33;Client;It’s hard because almost everyone I know uses it.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;34;Therapist;Is there anyone in your life who doesn’t use methamphetamine?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;35;Client;My sister. We’re pretty close, and I think she’d help me if I talked to her about it.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;36;Therapist;That’s a great idea. On one hand, quitting feels difficult because meth is tied to your social life. On the other hand, you have strong reasons to want to stop, and there are steps you can take, like talking to your sister for support. How does that sound to you?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;37;Client;Yeah, that makes sense.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;38;Therapist;I recommend stopping methamphetamine use altogether, but the decision is yours. Would you like to meet again in a month to check in?;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;39;Client;Sure, that works.;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;40;Therapist;Great. I’m here to support you, Tom. Let’s take this one step at a time.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;0;Therapist;Well, welcome, Ricky. It’s nice to meet you. Did you find us okay?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;1;Client;Yeah, it was pretty straightforward.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;2;Therapist;Great. Have you been here before?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;3;Client;No, this is my first time.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;4;Therapist;Alright. I know a little about why you’re here today, but it’s great to see you. Maybe a good place to start is for you to tell me why you’re here.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;5;Client;Sure. A few weeks ago, some friends came over and sat me down. They said I might need help with my drug use. At first, I was annoyed, but after thinking about it, I decided it couldn’t hurt to talk to someone.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;6;Therapist;So their concern led you to being here today?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;7;Client;Yeah. I did some research online and found this place, so I thought I’d give it a try.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;8;Therapist;It sounds like you’re open to exploring whether there’s something you need to look at. What do you think sparked their concern?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;9;Client;I guess they care about me. It was a bit of a shock, though. I didn’t think I was at a point where I needed an intervention.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;10;Therapist;It sounds like you were surprised by their concern. What do you think they’re worried about?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;11;Client;Probably my drug use. I use meth a couple of times a week, and sometimes party pills or smoke on weekends.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;12;Therapist;So, a couple of times a week for meth, and occasionally other substances. How does that feel for you when you say it out loud?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;13;Client;It sounds like a lot, but it doesn’t feel like a lot when I’m doing it.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;14;Therapist;That’s an interesting distinction. Let’s explore that a bit. What do you like about using meth? What’s the appeal for you?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;15;Client;It’s tied to my social life. I moved to Auckland a few years ago and found this new scene—gay bars, parties, and people who accept me. It’s a big change from where I grew up. Meth is just part of that scene. It makes me feel good, happy, and connected.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;16;Therapist;So, coming to Auckland and finding this community has been really positive for you, and meth is part of that experience. What about the downsides? Are there any concerns you have about your use?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;17;Client;Yeah, money is a big one. I used to have a steady acting job, but now I’m working part-time at a café. I’ve spent a lot on drugs and sometimes struggle to pay rent.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;18;Therapist;That sounds like a significant change. Do you think your drug use has affected your acting career?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;19;Client;Maybe. I might’ve missed some opportunities or not done as well in auditions because of it.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;20;Therapist;That’s a big concern, especially if acting is your passion. What else worries you?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;21;Client;My friends and flatmates are concerned. They said if I don’t get help, they might not want to hang out anymore. That would be hard because they’re important to me.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;22;Therapist;It sounds like your relationships are a big motivator for you. What about your health? Have you noticed any effects on your physical appearance or energy levels?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;23;Client;I’ve wondered if I look tired or run down. I haven’t thought about it much before, but now I’m starting to.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;24;Therapist;It sounds like you’re beginning to reflect on how meth might be affecting different areas of your life—your career, finances, relationships, and health. What do you think might happen if you don’t make any changes?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;25;Client;I’m worried about my acting career. I don’t want to keep working in cafes. I also don’t want to lose my friends or keep struggling with money.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;26;Therapist;Those are really valid concerns. It sounds like you’re at a point where you’re weighing the positives and negatives of your drug use. What do you think could be a first step toward making a change?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;27;Client;I guess cutting back on the weekday use. Doing it alone on a Wednesday doesn’t feel great when I think about it.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;28;Therapist;That’s a good insight. What do you think could help you replace that midweek use?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;29;Client;Maybe finding something else to look forward to, like a group or activity.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;30;Therapist;That’s a great idea. There are gay social groups and activities that don’t revolve around drugs. Would you be open to exploring those options?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;31;Client;Yeah, I’d be willing to give it a try.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;32;Therapist;That’s a positive step. It’s not about giving up everything you enjoy but finding ways to improve your situation and take control. How does that sound to you?;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;33;Client;It sounds good. I want to focus on my acting and not let drugs get in the way.;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;34;Therapist;That’s a great goal. Let’s work together to find some options that fit your lifestyle and help you move forward.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;So, I hear that many people have told you if you quit smoking, you might gain weight. What are your thoughts about that?;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Yeah, they say food tastes better after quitting, but the downside is I’ll probably gain weight. That means I’d need a new wardrobe, which I can’t afford right now.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;I see. Smoking has been a part of your life for 18 years, and now you’re worried about the changes quitting might bring, like weight gain. What else concerns you about quitting?;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;Withdrawal. I’ve heard it’s awful—being cranky and irritable. I just hope my friends will understand and support me through it.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;That’s a valid concern. Withdrawal can be tough, and having support from friends is important. What else feels like a downside to quitting?;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;Honestly, I’ve smoked for so long, I can’t imagine life without it. It’s just become such a big part of my routine.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;It sounds like smoking is deeply ingrained in your daily life, and the idea of quitting feels overwhelming. What about the positives? What makes you think about quitting now?;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;Well, I don’t have any health problems from smoking right now, but my doctor warned me about what could happen in the future. That made me rethink things.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;So, the potential health risks are a big motivator for you. What do you think might happen if you don’t quit?;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;I guess I could develop serious health issues down the line. That’s not something I want to risk.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;It sounds like you’re weighing the pros and cons. On one hand, quitting could help you avoid future health problems, but on the other, you’re worried about weight gain, withdrawal, and losing a part of your routine. How do you feel about that balance?;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;It’s hard. I know I need to quit, but the challenges make it feel really daunting.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;That’s completely understandable. Quitting is a big change, and it’s normal to feel unsure. What do you think might help you feel more confident about taking that step?;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;Maybe having a plan for dealing with withdrawal and weight gain. And knowing my friends will support me.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;Those are great ideas. Having a plan and a support system can make a big difference. Would you like to explore some strategies for managing withdrawal and weight gain?;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;Yeah, that would help.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;Great. Let’s start by brainstorming some options. For example, staying active and finding healthy snacks could help with weight management. And for withdrawal, we could look into nicotine replacement therapies or other tools to ease the process. How does that sound?;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;That sounds good. I’d be willing to try those things.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;That’s a positive step. It’s not about making huge changes all at once but finding small, manageable steps that work for you. Let’s work together to create a plan that feels doable. How does that sound?;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;It sounds like a good start. I’m still nervous, but I’m willing to give it a try.;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;That’s all we can ask for. Taking the first step is often the hardest part, but you’re not alone in this. Let’s check in again soon to see how you’re feeling and adjust the plan as needed.;;;
66;high;diabetes management;0;Therapist;Hi, Mr. Stowe. I’m Bruce Berger, a case manager with your health plan. How are you doing today?;;;
66;high;diabetes management;1;Client;Hey. Pleasure to meet you.;;;
66;high;diabetes management;2;Therapist;I understand you’re here to talk about managing your diabetes. Can you tell me a little about how you’re feeling after your recent diagnosis?;;;
66;high;diabetes management;3;Client;Yeah, I just found out I have diabetes, and it’s pretty bad. My blood sugar is sky high, and the doctor laid out all these scary consequences—like problems with my eyes, legs, and circulation. It feels overwhelming.;;;
66;high;diabetes management;4;Therapist;It sounds like you’re still processing the news. You’re worried about the potential complications and everything the doctor said you need to do to manage it. Is that right?;;;
66;high;diabetes management;5;Client;Exactly. It’s discouraging. I don’t want those things to happen, but the list of changes feels impossible. I’m sitting here thinking, “Oh my God, this is my future.”;;;
66;high;diabetes management;6;Therapist;I hear how overwhelming this feels. On one hand, you’re scared about the health risks, and on the other, the steps to manage it seem like a massive task. Let’s break this down into smaller, doable pieces so it feels less daunting. How does that sound?;;;
66;high;diabetes management;7;Client;That sounds better. I just don’t know where to start.;;;
66;high;diabetes management;8;Therapist;That’s completely understandable. Let’s focus on one thing at a time. The first step is taking your medication as prescribed. That’s the most impactful change you can make right now. How do you feel about that?;;;
66;high;diabetes management;9;Client;I think I can handle that. I’m pretty good at taking medication, especially since I know my blood sugar is really high.;;;
66;high;diabetes management;10;Therapist;That’s great to hear. Taking your medication consistently will make a big difference. The next steps would be adjusting your eating habits and increasing physical activity. You don’t need to overhaul everything at once—small changes like eating healthier and walking more can help. How does that sound?;;;
66;high;diabetes management;11;Client;That sounds manageable. The doctor also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar, but that seems like a lot of work.;;;
66;high;diabetes management;12;Therapist;Monitoring your blood sugar is important because it gives you feedback on how well your medication, diet, and activity are working. It’s not about adding stress but helping you stay on track. Does that make sense?;;;
66;high;diabetes management;13;Client;Yeah, that makes sense. I like the idea of taking it step by step. It takes some of the pressure off.;;;
66;high;diabetes management;14;Therapist;Absolutely. Breaking it down makes it feel more achievable. You’ve already shown commitment by being here today and being open to taking your medication. What’s one small change you’d feel comfortable starting with?;;;
66;high;diabetes management;15;Client;I think starting with the medication is doable. I’m pretty sure I can handle that.;;;
66;high;diabetes management;16;Therapist;That’s a great first step. Once you’re comfortable with that, we can work on the next steps, like healthier eating or adding a little more activity to your day. How does that plan sound to you?;;;
66;high;diabetes management;17;Client;It sounds good. I feel better knowing I don’t have to do everything at once.;;;
66;high;diabetes management;18;Therapist;"That’s the goal—to make this feel manageable and less overwhelming. You’re not alone in this; we’ll work through it together. Let’s check in again soon to see how you’re doing with the medication and plan the next steps.";;;
67;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Is it okay if we go over the form you filled out? We give this to everyone who comes in.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Sure.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;Great. It looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol a few times in the last year and used marijuana more often—about 30 days in the last year. Does that sound right?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;Yeah, something like that.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;When I talk to students about substance use, I always start by saying I’m not here to tell you what to do. My role is to help you think about whether there’s anything you’d like to change. What can you tell me about your marijuana use?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;I vape it. I have a pen, but I don’t smoke it.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;How often do you vape?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;A few times a month.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;Do you vape anything else besides marijuana?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;I tried peppermint oil once—someone shared it with me.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;Got it. Is it okay if I share some information with you about marijuana?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;Sure.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;We know marijuana can affect the developing brain. It can make it harder to concentrate or remember things, and vaping can harm your lungs. About one in six people who start using marijuana as teenagers become addicted later on. What do you think about that?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;I don’t think it’s going to hurt me.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;How do you think it affects you?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;It helps me relax, and it’s fun to laugh with my friends.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;Is there anything about marijuana that worries you or that you don’t like?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;I don’t want to get in trouble at school.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;How could that happen?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;If I get caught, I could get suspended or kicked off the basketball team.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;Staying in school and playing basketball are important to you?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;Yeah, definitely.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;So, when you think about these things, is there anything you’d like to change about your marijuana use?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;23;Client;I was thinking about not using it when basketball season starts.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;What would be the benefits of that?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;25;Client;I play better when I’m not high, and I wouldn’t risk getting kicked off the team.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;That makes sense. It sounds like you have a goal to stop using marijuana during basketball season. How long do you think you could go without using?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;27;Client;Maybe a month.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;If I asked you to rate your confidence in meeting that goal on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not confident at all and 10 is very confident, what number would you pick?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;29;Client;A seven.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;30;Therapist;Why a seven and not a lower number like five?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;31;Client;I’m pretty sure I can stop for a month. I really want to play well.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;32;Therapist;That’s great. What steps could you take to help you stop using for a month?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;33;Client;I’m not sure.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;34;Therapist;What might happen during that month that could make you want to vape?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;35;Client;If I’m stressed or unhappy, that’s usually when I want to vape.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;36;Therapist;What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way?;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;37;Client;I like playing video games or basketball with my friend Sarah.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;38;Therapist;Those sound like great alternatives. Playing basketball and video games can help you feel better without vaping.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;39;Client;Yeah, they do.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;40;Therapist;I’m glad to hear you have a goal to quit for a month and feel confident about it. If you’re willing, I’d love to check in with you in a month to see how it’s going.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;41;Client;Sure, that sounds good.;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;42;Therapist;Great. Good luck with basketball practice. If you need anything or want to talk before our next appointment, I’m here Monday through Thursday. It’s always good to see you.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi, Andrea. Thanks for coming in today. How are you doing?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Hi. I’m good, thanks.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Great. Let me start by telling you a bit about my role here. I meet with students to talk about how things are going, behaviors they might be engaging in, and any changes they’d like to make. My job isn’t to change you—it’s to help you think about your goals and how to move forward. Does that sound okay?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Yeah, that sounds good.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Perfect. Let’s start by you telling me a little about yourself.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Sure. I’m Andrea, a junior in high school. I’m in the marching band—I play the tenor sax—and I’m also in the wind ensemble and jazz band. I’ve been playing music for about 10 years.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;That’s amazing! You’re really involved in music. What else do you enjoy doing?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;I like hanging out with friends, going to the beach, and just relaxing.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;Sounds like a good balance. Tell me about your family.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I have an older brother who’s eight years older, my parents, and a Golden Retriever. He’s my big boy.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;Aww, Golden Retrievers are great. How’s school going for you?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;It’s going well. I have around a 3.7 GPA.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;That’s impressive. What are your goals after high school?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I’d like to go to an Ivy League school and eventually become a psychiatrist or something in medicine.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Those are big dreams—very exciting. It sounds like you’re really focused on your future. Let’s talk about what’s important to you in life. What values guide you?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;I’d say a sense of community, belonging, and respect.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;Can you tell me more about why those are important to you?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Sure. Being in the marching band gives me a sense of belonging and purpose. And respect—I think it’s important to respect myself and others.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;That’s really thoughtful. It sounds like being part of a team and treating others well are central to who you are. Let’s talk about your social life. What do you and your friends like to do together?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;We go to the movies, the beach, or just hang out at someone’s house and play board games.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;That sounds fun. Is alcohol ever part of those gatherings?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Sometimes, especially at parties.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;How often would you say you drink?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Maybe two or three weekends a month.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;What’s different about the times you drink versus when you don’t?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Drinking usually happens at parties—it’s more about dancing and having fun. When we don’t drink, it’s more relaxed, like playing games or watching movies.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;Do you notice a difference in how much you enjoy those activities?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;They’re different. Parties are fun but draining, while game nights are relaxing.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;What do you like about drinking?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;It helps everyone loosen up and have fun, but too much can lead to bad decisions.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;What are some of the downsides?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;People can get sloppy, throw up, or do things they regret. I’ve had to take care of friends who drank too much, and it ruins my fun.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;It sounds like you’re trying to balance having fun with staying safe. What steps do you take to minimize risks?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;We stay at someone’s house, don’t drive, and stick with trusted friends. I also make my own drinks to control how much I’m drinking.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;That’s smart. Why did you decide to take those precautions?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;I have an aunt who’s an alcoholic, and I’ve seen the dangers of drinking too much. I want to have fun but stay safe.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;That makes sense. How do you think drinking fits with your values, like respect for yourself?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Drinking can feel like disrespecting my body, but I try to limit it to stay in control.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;It sounds like you’re looking for a balance. What’s your plan for cutting back?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;I’d like to plan more activities without alcohol and encourage my friends to drink less.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;That’s a great goal. How important is it to you to make these changes, on a scale of 1 to 10?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;Probably a 6 or 7. I know it’s important, but it’s not urgent.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;Why not a 4?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;Because I don’t want to harm my body, especially with my goals for med school. I know drinking every weekend won’t work in college.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;That’s a good point. How confident are you that you could cut back if you decided to?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;If I made the decision, I’d say a 10. It’s just about committing to it.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;That’s great to hear. Would you like to work on this goal together?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;Yeah, I think so.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;Let’s plan to meet again in a few weeks to see how it’s going. Does that work for you?;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;Client;Yes, that sounds good.;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;Therapist;Great. I’m really impressed by your goals and your willingness to reflect on your habits. Let’s take this step by step.;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Hi, Dr. Martin. I heard you had a question for me. What did you want to talk about?;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;I’m sorry, but are you the pharmacist? I just had a question about citalopram.;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;Yes, I’m the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram is an antidepressant available in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It’s excreted in the urine and has a half-life of about 35 hours. Common side effects include sexual, heart, and stomach-related issues. What specifically did you want to know?;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;I just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine.;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;Ah, I see. Let me double-check that for you. [Pauses to verify] Actually, citalopram and phenelzine should not be taken together. Combining them can lead to a serious condition called serotonin syndrome, which can be dangerous. I’d recommend discussing this with your prescribing doctor to find a safer alternative.;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;Oh, I didn’t realize that. Thanks for letting me know. I’ll talk to my doctor.;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;You’re welcome. It’s always good to check for interactions, especially with medications like these. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to call me anytime.;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;I will. Thanks again. I have an appointment to run to now.;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;Of course. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Hi, Dr. Martin. I’m Lori, the pharmacist on duty today. I understand you have some questions about citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about it?;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Yeah, I do, but just a couple of minutes.;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;Of course. Do you have any specific questions about citalopram?;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Not really. I’m just unfamiliar with the medication.;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;Okay. Citalopram is an SSRI, commonly prescribed for depression. It’s typically dosed at 20 milligrams, but it’s also available in 10 and 40 milligrams. Patients usually start to see improvement in symptoms within four to eight weeks. Does that make sense so far?;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;Yes. What about side effects?;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;Common side effects include gastrointestinal issues, sedation, and sexual dysfunction. If a patient experiences these, you might consider lowering the dose or switching to a different medication. Does that answer your question?;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Yes, thanks. Does it interact with phenelzine?;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;That’s a great question. I’m not entirely sure about that interaction. Can I look it up and get back to you later this afternoon with an answer?;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;Sure, that works.;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;Fantastic. I’ll make sure to follow up with you. Thanks for asking—it’s always important to check for interactions.;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;Thank you.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;So, you’ve shared this dream with me—having a partner, a house, a nice car, kids, and being a great dad. That’s quite a picture. How does that dream feel to you right now?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;1;Client;Yeah, it feels good. It’s something I really want.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;It sounds like it’s really important to you. I’m curious—how does offending fit into that picture?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;I guess it doesn’t. It kinda messes things up.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;How so? Can you tell me more about how it messes things up?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;Well, I keep having to come back here, go to court, and it’s hard to keep a job or even get one.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;Yeah, it sounds like it’s creating some real barriers. Like, you mentioned it’s hard to get a job because of your record. What’s that been like for you?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;It’s tough. You have to tell people you’ve been in prison, and it’s just… it’s hard, you know?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;Absolutely. It sounds like it’s making things harder for you to move toward that dream. We’ve talked before about your passion for cars. How’s that been going?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it. Maybe going to polytech, doing some courses, getting a qualification.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;That’s a great idea. What’s drawing you to that path?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;I just love working with cars. It’s hands-on, and I think I’d be good at it.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;That’s awesome. So, if you could have any job in the car industry, what would it be?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;[sighs] Maybe a mechanic or something in panel work. I don’t care, as long as it’s about cars.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;That’s great to hear. So, what do you think you need to do to get started on that path?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;I guess I need to get some training, maybe an apprenticeship.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;That makes sense. You mentioned polytech earlier. Have you looked into what that would involve?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;Yeah, I picked up some forms, but… they’re confusing. I didn’t know how to fill them out.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;That’s a big step, Billy—picking up the forms. What’s been confusing about them?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;I don’t know… I’m not good at writing. People say they can’t read my handwriting.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;[chuckles] Sounds like you’ve got doctor-level handwriting. But seriously, what’s been the hardest part about filling them out?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;I just don’t know what to write. It’s overwhelming.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;That’s understandable. When you’ve had to fill out forms before, how’s that gone for you?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;I usually avoid it. I don’t like writing.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;24;therapist;So, it sounds like writing isn’t your strong suit. What would help you get through this step?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;25;client;Maybe if I could use a computer or get someone to help me.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;26;therapist;That’s a good idea. Who could you ask for help?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;27;client;I guess Donna, but… it’s embarrassing.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;28;therapist;It sounds like you’re worried about what she might think. What’s the worst that could happen if you asked her?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;29;client;I don’t know… she might think I’m dumb or something.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;30;therapist;That’s a tough feeling. But it sounds like this is a really important step toward your dream. What’s more important—getting past this hurdle or staying stuck because of embarrassment?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;31;client;I guess getting past it.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;32;therapist;That’s a great perspective. So, what’s one small step you could take before our next session to move forward with the forms?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;33;client;Maybe I could ask Donna for help.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;34;therapist;That sounds like a solid plan. And if that feels too big, we can brainstorm other options too. How does that sound?;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;35;client;Yeah, that’s okay.;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;36;therapist;Great. Let’s check in on that next time. For now, I want to acknowledge how much effort you’re putting into this. It’s not easy, but you’re taking steps, and that’s what matters.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Chris, I wanted to talk to you because, as you know, we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school. As the athletic director, it’s my job to ensure all student-athletes adhere to that rule. I’ve heard some chatter about a party this weekend, and your name came up. I’m not here to give consequences, but I do want to check in with you about this. How are you feeling about all of this?;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Actually, I do want to talk about what happened this past weekend. I’m usually an honor student, and my parents don’t let me go out to parties. But this time, I convinced them to let me go because my friends were pressuring me. When I got there, it was like something out of a movie—people drinking straight from bottles, playing drinking games, and just trying to get drunk. I felt pressured to go along with it so I wouldn’t be left out.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;That sounds like a really tough situation. It’s hard to be in an environment where you feel like you have to conform to fit in. Can you tell me more about how you felt in that moment?;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;I felt really out of place. I’m not used to that kind of environment, and I didn’t want to be the odd one out. But I also know it’s bad for me—bad for my body, my performance as an athlete, and my reputation. I’m starting to think I need to find different friends or at least stand up for myself more.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;It sounds like you’re really reflecting on this. You mentioned feeling pressured by your friends. What do you think it would take for you to handle those situations differently?;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;I don’t know. I feel like as a leader on the team, I’m expected to go along with the group, even in social situations. But I also know I shouldn’t be drinking, especially as an athlete. It’s a tough balance.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;You’re right—it is a tough balance. But as a leader, you have the opportunity to set an example. What would it look like if you led by not drinking in those situations?;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;I guess I could try, but I’m worried about being ridiculed or called “stuck up” for not drinking. It’s hard to go against the group.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;That’s a valid concern. But you’re also a star player—people respect you. Do you think your teammates would really ridicule you for making a healthy choice?;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Maybe not. But it’s still hard to be the only one saying no. I feel like it’s me against the crowd.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;I hear you. It’s not easy to stand alone. But let’s think about this: what’s more important to you—fitting in at a party or staying true to your goals as an athlete and student?;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Staying true to my goals, definitely. I don’t want to jeopardize my future or my spot on the team.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;That’s a great perspective. So, what’s one thing you can do differently next time you’re in a situation like that?;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;I think I’ll avoid those parties altogether. Or if I do go, I’ll make sure I’m not in any photos or situations where I feel pressured to drink. I don’t want anything to end up on social media or risk my place on the team.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;That sounds like a solid plan. It’s about making choices that align with your values and goals. How confident are you that you can stick to this plan?;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;I’m pretty confident. I know it’s the right thing to do, and I don’t want to let myself or the team down.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;That’s great to hear, Chris. I’m here to support you in this. Let’s check in again soon to see how things are going. Sound good?;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks for talking this through with me.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Of course. You’ve got this, Chris. I’ll see you later.;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;See you later.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;0;client;He, um, introduced me to it too, so I’ve tried it.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;1;therapist;So, with his encouragement, you tried some drugs. Can you tell me more about that?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;2;client;Oxy.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;3;therapist;You tried oxy? Okay. What was that experience like for you?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;4;client;Yeah. He said it was a pain medicine.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;5;therapist;So, he told you it could help with the pain you’ve been feeling?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;6;client;Mm-hmm.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;7;therapist;And how has it been for you since you started using it?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;8;client;It has helped, but I don’t do it often—just sometimes.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;9;therapist;Okay, so you trusted his advice, tried it, and found it helpful in some ways. What kind of pain has it helped you with?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;10;client;Dealing with my grandma’s loss.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;11;therapist;I’m sorry to hear about your grandma. It sounds like her loss has been really hard for you. How has the oxy helped with that?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;12;client;Yeah. I feel alone, and I just… I miss her. It does help, but… I don’t want to have to rely on it.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;13;therapist;So, it’s been helpful in the moment, but you don’t want to depend on it long-term. Is that right?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;14;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;15;therapist;It sounds like you’re aware of the risks of relying on it too much. What’s making you feel unsure about continuing to use it?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;16;client;I just… I don’t want to become dependent on it.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;17;therapist;That’s a really important insight. It sounds like you’re trying to manage a lot right now—your grief, your pain, and figuring out how to cope in a way that feels safe for you. How are you feeling about all of this?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;18;client;Yeah, it is a lot.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;19;therapist;You’ve been doing the best you can to manage everything. It sounds like you have some doubts about using oxy, though. What’s on your mind about it?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;20;client;I don’t really know too much about it, other than it makes me feel good.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;21;therapist;So, for now, you know it helps you feel better, but you’re also aware that there’s more to learn about it. What would you like to understand better about oxy or other ways to cope with your pain and grief?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;22;client;I guess I want to know if there are other ways to feel better without relying on it.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;23;therapist;That’s a great question. Exploring other ways to cope could help you feel more in control. What are some things you’ve tried in the past to manage your grief or pain?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;24;client;I haven’t really tried much else. I just… I don’t know where to start.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;25;therapist;That’s okay. It’s not easy to figure this out on your own. Would you be open to exploring some other options together?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;26;client;Yeah, I think so.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;27;therapist;Great. We can look into some healthier ways to cope, like talking to someone, finding support groups, or even trying activities that help you feel connected and grounded. How does that sound?;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;28;client;That sounds good. I just… I don’t want to keep feeling like I need oxy to get by.;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;29;therapist;I hear you. It’s clear that you want to find a better way forward, and that’s a really strong starting point. Let’s work together to figure out what that might look like for you.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;0;client;Hi.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;1;therapist;Hi, Deborah. It’s great to see you today. How are you feeling?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;2;client;I’m doing really good, thanks.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;3;therapist;That’s wonderful to hear. Last time, you mentioned working on your Values Clarification Sheet. Did anything stand out to you while completing it?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;4;client;Yeah, I did. I rated health as my top value—physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. It’s all interconnected for me.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;5;therapist;That’s a powerful insight. Health as a holistic package. What does that mean for you in your daily life?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;6;client;Well, I’m actually working on a certification to become a fitness trainer. It’s a big shift from being an office worker, but I’m excited about it.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;7;therapist;That’s a significant change! What’s driving this shift toward fitness and health for you?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;8;client;I’ve always valued being active. I love tennis, for example, but I don’t think I’m skilled enough to coach it. Still, I want to help others improve their health and well-being.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;9;therapist;It sounds like health isn’t just a value for you—it’s a passion. Have you noticed if this value has always been a priority for you?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;10;client;It’s always been in my top three, but I’m not sure if it’s always been number one. This time, I put inner harmony as my second value.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;11;therapist;Inner harmony—that’s interesting. What does inner harmony look like for you?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;12;client;It’s about being at peace with myself. I’ve been practicing and teaching yoga, and it’s helped me feel more centered. I’m learning to put myself first without feeling selfish.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;13;therapist;That’s a big shift—putting yourself first. How has that changed the way you approach relationships or helping others?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;14;client;I used to always put others first, thinking that’s what a good person should do. But now, I realize I can help others without neglecting myself. It’s about balance.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;15;therapist;Balance is key. It sounds like you’re finding a way to honor your own needs while still being there for others. How does that feel for you?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;16;client;It feels empowering. Like when my brother and his family stay over, I don’t mind sleeping on the air mattress because it’s temporary. I know I’m helping them, and it doesn’t take away from my own well-being.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;17;therapist;That’s a great example of balancing service and self-care. Speaking of values, you mentioned wisdom as another priority. How does that show up in your life?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;18;client;I love learning—whether it’s in a classroom or through experiences like spending time in Native American communities. It’s about being open to different cultures and perspectives.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;19;therapist;That’s beautiful. It sounds like wisdom and curiosity are deeply connected for you. How does that openness influence your sense of inner harmony?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;20;client;It helps me stay grounded, even when things don’t go my way. Like with politics—I might not agree with certain outcomes, but I can still find peace within myself.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;21;therapist;That’s a resilient mindset. It seems like your values—health, inner harmony, service, wisdom—are all interconnected, guiding you toward a balanced and fulfilling life.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;22;client;Yeah, they really are. And I’ve come to accept that life isn’t always perfect. There’s joy, but there’s also pain, and that’s okay.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;23;therapist;That’s a profound realization. Accepting both the highs and lows is a sign of growth. How do you feel about where you are right now in this journey?;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;24;client;I feel good. I’m more at peace with myself and my decisions. It’s been a process, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;25;therapist;You should be proud. It’s been inspiring to hear about your journey today. Thank you for sharing so openly.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;26;client;Thank you for listening. It’s been really helpful to talk through this.;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;27;therapist;You’re welcome, Deborah. I’m here to support you. Let’s continue building on this progress next time.;;;
78;high;asthma management;0;Therapist;Hi, Julie? I’m Bruce Berger, one of the clinicians here. How are you doing today?;;;
78;high;asthma management;1;Client;Yeah, I’m Julie. I’m okay, thanks.;;;
78;high;asthma management;2;Therapist;Thanks for taking the time to talk. I see you’re here for Sarah’s rescue inhaler.;;;
78;high;asthma management;3;Client;Yeah, that’s right.;;;
78;high;asthma management;4;Therapist;I noticed Sarah’s been to the ER a few times this year for her asthma. How’s that been for you?;;;
78;high;asthma management;5;Client;It’s been really hard. Seeing her struggle to breathe is terrifying. I hate it.;;;
78;high;asthma management;6;Therapist;That sounds incredibly stressful. It’s clear how much you care about her.;;;
78;high;asthma management;7;Client;I do. I’d do anything to help her.;;;
78;high;asthma management;8;Therapist;That’s really admirable. I also noticed it’s been a while since you picked up her chronic inhaler. Are there any concerns there?;;;
78;high;asthma management;9;Client;Yeah, actually. I read that it has steroids, and I’m worried about the side effects. I don’t want her exposed to that.;;;
78;high;asthma management;10;Therapist;It’s great that you’re so informed and looking out for her. Can we talk a bit about the medication and your concerns?;;;
78;high;asthma management;11;Client;Sure.;;;
78;high;asthma management;12;Therapist;The steroids in her inhaler are corticosteroids, which are very different from the anabolic steroids you might be thinking of. They’re safe and specifically reduce inflammation in her lungs. Does that make sense?;;;
78;high;asthma management;13;Client;I didn’t realize they were different. So they won’t harm her?;;;
78;high;asthma management;14;Therapist;Not at all. They’re designed to stay in her lungs and help her breathe better.;;;
78;high;asthma management;15;Client;Okay, that’s a relief.;;;
78;high;asthma management;16;Therapist;I’m glad to hear that. Now, when Sarah’s asthma flares up, her lungs are super sensitive, like raw skin. The chronic inhaler helps calm that down so she doesn’t end up in the ER. Does that sound like something you’d want to try?;;;
78;high;asthma management;17;Client;Yeah, if it helps her, I’m willing.;;;
78;high;asthma management;18;Therapist;That’s great. Another thing—I noticed you mentioned you smoke but avoid doing it around her. That’s really thoughtful.;;;
78;high;asthma management;19;Client;Yeah, I never smoke near her.;;;
78;high;asthma management;20;Therapist;That’s good. But even the smoke on your clothes can affect her lungs. Have you noticed any patterns when she’s around you?;;;
78;high;asthma management;21;Client;I didn’t realize it could still affect her. That’s concerning.;;;
78;high;asthma management;22;Therapist;It’s a small thing, but it can make a difference. Have you thought about ways to reduce that exposure?;;;
78;high;asthma management;23;Client;Maybe I could smoke only when she’s at school and change clothes before she gets home.;;;
78;high;asthma management;24;Therapist;That’s a great idea! It shows how much you’re willing to adapt for her.;;;
78;high;asthma management;25;Client;I just want her to be okay.;;;
78;high;asthma management;26;Therapist;That’s really clear. So, to summarize, you’re open to trying the chronic inhaler and making some changes to reduce smoke exposure. How does that sound?;;;
78;high;asthma management;27;Client;Yeah, I think that’s doable.;;;
78;high;asthma management;28;Therapist;That’s fantastic. Let’s get those prescriptions ready and check in soon to see how it’s going.;;;
78;high;asthma management;29;Client;Okay, thank you.;;;
78;high;asthma management;30;Therapist;You’re welcome. You’re doing a great job, Julie. Take care.;;;
79;high;managing life;0;client;Something clicked, I'd had a bunch to drink, and I knew I messed up. Totally messed up.;;;
79;high;managing life;1;therapist;It sounds like that moment was really significant for you. What made you realize you'd messed up?;;;
79;high;managing life;2;client;I was right there, man. Right in the same place where I'd come home and pop a couple of pills. It was the same deal—I wanted to stay there, in that feeling. But then it hit me: I’d ruined everything. Erin called me the next day, and it was great, but I just felt... ashamed. I don’t want to feel that way again.;;;
79;high;managing life;3;therapist;That sounds like a really powerful moment of clarity. It seems like you recognized that something important to you was at risk. Is that what brought up those feelings of guilt and shame?;;;
79;high;managing life;4;client;Yeah, exactly. I mean, I could’ve kept going. I could’ve gotten hammered every night that week. But I didn’t. I stopped. I just don’t know if I stopped because I knew I had to or because... I don’t know, it’s confusing.;;;
79;high;managing life;5;therapist;It sounds like there’s a part of you that knew stopping was the right thing to do, even if it wasn’t easy. And now, three months later, you’ve made so much progress. How does it feel to look back at how far you’ve come?;;;
79;high;managing life;6;client;It feels better, yeah. Things are better. I mean, I can see my kids now, and that’s... that’s everything.;;;
79;high;managing life;7;therapist;That’s huge. It sounds like being able to see your kids was a big motivator for you. How does it feel to know that your efforts have made that possible?;;;
79;high;managing life;8;client;It feels good, you know? Like, I’m not perfect, but I’m trying. And seeing them—it’s like a reminder of why I’m doing this.;;;
79;high;managing life;9;therapist;That’s such a powerful insight. It sounds like you’re really connecting with what matters most to you. What do you think has been the biggest change in you over these past three months?;;;
79;high;managing life;10;client;I think... I’m more aware now. Like, I can see when I’m heading down that path, and I know I don’t want to go there anymore. It’s not always easy, but I’m trying to stay focused on what’s important.;;;
79;high;managing life;11;therapist;That awareness is such a key part of growth. It’s not about being perfect—it’s about recognizing those moments and making choices that align with what you truly value. How do you want to keep building on this progress moving forward?;;;
79;high;managing life;12;client;I just want to keep going, you know? Keep making those better choices. For my kids, for Erin, for myself. I don’t want to lose what I’ve worked so hard to get back.;;;
79;high;managing life;13;therapist;That’s a really strong commitment. It sounds like you’ve got a clear vision of what you want to protect and build on. Let’s keep working together to make sure you have the tools and support you need to keep moving forward.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Jean, it’s great to see you again. How have you been since our last session?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Hi, doctor. I’ve been okay, just trying to work on what we discussed.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;That’s good to hear. What’s been different for you over the past week?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I did the journaling like we talked about. I tracked my smoking and urges.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;That’s a big step. How did it feel to keep track of those moments?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;5;client;It was eye-opening. I realized I smoke more when I’m at home or with friends.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;It sounds like you’ve gained some valuable insights. What stood out the most?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;7;client;I noticed I cut down by two or three cigarettes during the week, but weekends are harder.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;That’s progress! Cutting down by two or three cigarettes is a significant change. What made the weekends more challenging?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;9;client;On weekends, I’m around friends who smoke, and I have more free time. It’s harder to resist.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;It makes sense that social settings and downtime can trigger stronger urges. How did you handle those moments?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;11;client;I tried to delay smoking, but it was tough. I marked it in the journal, though.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;That’s great—you’re being honest with yourself and tracking patterns. What do you think could help you manage those weekend urges?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Maybe I need to find something to keep me busy, like a hobby or a group activity.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;That’s a thoughtful idea. What kind of hobby or activity appeals to you?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;15;client;I’ve always wanted to try painting or join a book club. Something to distract me.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Those sound like great options. How do you feel about starting small, like setting a goal to try one new activity this weekend?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;17;client;I think I could do that. And maybe I’ll avoid keeping cigarettes at home too.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;That’s a solid plan. Avoiding triggers at home can make a big difference. What else would you like to focus on this week?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;19;client;I’d like to keep journaling and maybe cut down by another three cigarettes.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;That’s a clear and achievable goal. What strategies do you think will help you reduce by three more?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;21;client;I’ll try to count my cigarettes each day and delay smoking when the urge comes.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;That’s a great approach. Delaying and counting can help you stay in control. How do you feel about checking in again next week to review your progress?;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;23;client;I’d like that. A week feels manageable, and it helps to talk about it with you.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Absolutely. You’re doing important work, Jean, and I’m here to support you. Let’s meet again in a week.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Thank you, doctor. I’ll see you then.;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Take care, Jean. I’m looking forward to hearing about your progress.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;How would you describe your experience growing up with your parents?;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;It was... okay, I guess. They were strict, but I know they cared.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;It sounds like there were some challenges, but also love. How do you think that shaped who you are today?;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Hmm, I think it made me responsible, but sometimes I feel like I don’t know how to handle my own emotions.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;That’s a really insightful reflection. Lately, you’ve mentioned feeling some changes—can you tell me more about how you’ve been feeling?;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;Yeah, I’ve been feeling... bigger, like my body is changing, and it’s kind of scary.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;Change can feel scary, especially when it’s something new. What about these changes feels most overwhelming to you?;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;I don’t know... I guess it’s like there’s something inside me that I don’t understand. And I know I should see a doctor, but I haven’t.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;It sounds like there’s a lot on your mind. What’s been stopping you from reaching out to the doctor?;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;I don’t know... it just feels like too much. The phone calls, the paperwork, figuring out how to get there... and I really don’t like needles.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;It makes sense that all of that feels overwhelming. It’s a lot to manage, especially when you’re already feeling unsure about the changes in your body. What part of this feels the hardest for you right now?;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;Probably making the call. I just freeze every time I think about it.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;That’s a common feeling. How would it feel if we worked on this together? Maybe we could make the call right here, during our session, so you don’t have to do it alone.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;That... that would actually help a lot. But what about the appointment itself? I’m scared to go alone.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;Therapist;I hear how important it is for you to have support. While I can’t promise I’ll be available, we can brainstorm who else might be able to go with you—someone you trust. How does that sound?;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;Client;Yeah, that sounds good. Maybe my cousin could come with me.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;Therapist;That’s a great idea. Let’s start with the call, and then we can figure out the rest step by step. How does that plan feel to you?;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;Client;It feels... manageable. Like I’m not alone in this.;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;Therapist;That’s exactly what we’re aiming for—breaking it down so it feels less overwhelming. You’re doing great, and I’m here to support you every step of the way.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi there! How are you feeling today? I thought we could take some time to explore how you’re feeling about alcohol use and contraception. Does that sound okay to you?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Yeah, that’s fine.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;"Great! Let’s start with alcohol. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is ""not important at all"" and 10 is ""extremely important,"" how important is it to you to stay within low-risk drinking limits?";;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;I’d say an eight.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;An eight—that’s pretty high. It sounds like staying within those limits matters to you. Can you tell me a bit more about why it’s an eight and not a lower number?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Well, I know there’s a history of alcoholism in my family, and I really don’t want to end up like that. It’s important to me to stay in control.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;That’s a really strong reason. It sounds like you’re motivated to avoid going down that path. Now, on the same scale, how confident are you right now that you can stay within those low-risk limits?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Hmm, I’d say a four.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;A four. So there’s some confidence there, but it’s not as high as the importance you place on it. What makes you feel like a four and not lower?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I think it’s because I have a group of friends who don’t drink much, and when I’m with them, it’s easier to stay within limits. But when I’m not with them, it’s harder.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;That’s a great insight. It sounds like your friends are a real support for you. What else helps you feel even a little confident about staying within those limits?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I guess knowing the risks and not wanting to repeat some of the mistakes I’ve seen in my family. That keeps me motivated.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;That’s really powerful. It sounds like you have a clear sense of what you want to avoid, and that’s driving your motivation. Let’s shift gears a bit and talk about contraception. On the same scale, how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I’d say an eight for that, too.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Another eight. It seems like this is really important to you as well. What makes it an eight?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;I just don’t want to risk an unplanned pregnancy. It’s not something I’m ready for right now.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;That makes a lot of sense. And how confident are you, on that same scale, that you can use birth control effectively every time?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Probably a six.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;A six. So you’re fairly confident, but there’s some room for improvement. What makes you feel like a six and not lower?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;I think if I drink less, I’ll be more consistent with it. When I drink too much, I sometimes forget or just don’t care in the moment.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;That’s an interesting connection. It sounds like your drinking and contraception use are linked in some ways. Do you feel like reducing your drinking could help you be more consistent with birth control?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Yeah, definitely.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;It sounds like you’ve thought a lot about this. You’ve identified some clear goals and challenges. How would you feel about working on a plan today to help you reduce your drinking and stay consistent with contraception?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;That sounds good. I’d like that.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Great! We can start by exploring some small, manageable steps. And remember, if you need more information or support, we can always adjust the plan as we go. How does that sound?;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Yeah, that works for me.;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;Perfect. Let’s get started.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hello, Rick. Welcome. It’s great to have you here today. How are you feeling?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Kia ora. I’m alright, just a bit nervous, I guess.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;That’s completely understandable. It takes courage to come here. How was your trip?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;It was fine, thanks. Just a bit of a drive from home.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;I see you’re from down south—Invercargill, right? What’s it like living there?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Yeah, born and raised. It’s quiet, peaceful. I’m a country boy at heart.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;That sounds lovely. How long have you been in Christchurch?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Since I was 18, so quite a while now.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;That’s a big move. Do you have family here, or is it just you?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Just me and my kids. My family’s all still down south.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;I see. So, Rick, before we dive in, what’s been on your mind as you came here today?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;I’ve been thinking about my kids, mostly. And, uh, taking time off work.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;It sounds like your kids are really important to you. Can you tell me more about that?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;Yeah, they’re my world. I just… I’ve messed things up, and I want to fix that.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;That’s a powerful realization. What would fixing things look like for you?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;I’d love to see them more, be there for them. Right now, I only see them fortnightly.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;therapist;That must be really hard for you. What do you think your kids would say if they heard you wanted to make these changes?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;client;I hope they’d be proud of me. I don’t want them to see me like this, though.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;therapist;It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of love and responsibility for them. What’s motivating you to make these changes now?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;19;client;I just can’t keep going like this. I want to be someone they can look up to.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;20;therapist;That’s a really strong motivation. On a scale of 1 to 100, how important is this change for you and your kids?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;21;client;100%. It’s everything to me.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;22;therapist;That’s a big number. What do you think it would take to get there?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;23;client;I don’t know where to start, honestly. I just know I need to do something.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;24;therapist;That’s okay. Sometimes the first step is the hardest. How do you feel about starting with this program?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;25;client;I think it’s a good place to start. I just don’t want to mess it up again.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;26;therapist;It sounds like you’re really committed this time. What’s different now compared to before?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;27;client;I’m thinking more about my kids. I don’t want to let them down anymore.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;28;therapist;That’s a strong foundation. Who else in your life do you think would support you in this journey?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;29;client;My mum, maybe. She’s always believed in me, even when I didn’t.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;30;therapist;That’s wonderful. How do you think she’d feel if she knew you were here today?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;31;client;She’d be proud. She’d probably say, “It’s about time.”;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;32;therapist;That’s a great image. What about your siblings or friends? Anyone else who might cheer you on?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;33;client;My brothers and sisters, yeah. They’ve always been there for me.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;34;therapist;It sounds like you’ve got a strong support system. How do you think they could help you stay on track?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;35;client;Just by being there, I guess. Listening, encouraging me.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;36;therapist;That’s a great start. Accountability can make a big difference. How confident are you feeling about this journey right now?;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;37;client;If I have my family behind me, I’d say 99% confident.;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;38;therapist;That’s a huge leap. It sounds like you’re ready to take this step. Let’s work together to make it happen.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;0;client;I just feel helpless about this whole deal.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;1;therapist;It sounds like you’re feeling overwhelmed and unsure of where to turn. Can you tell me more about what’s making you feel this way?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;2;client;Mm. I just feel like no matter what I do, nothing changes.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;3;therapist;That sounds really frustrating—like you’re putting in effort but not seeing the results you hoped for. What do you think might help you feel less stuck?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;4;client;I don’t know. No one wants to help me.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;5;therapist;It sounds like you’re feeling isolated, like you’re facing this alone. That must be really hard. Have you reached out to anyone, or does it feel like they wouldn’t understand?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;6;client;I’ve tried, but it’s like they don’t care.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;7;therapist;It’s tough when it feels like your efforts to connect aren’t being met. You’re carrying a lot of weight on your own. What would it look like if someone did understand or support you?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;8;client;I don’t know. I just… I really shouldn’t have done it.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;9;therapist;You’re reflecting on something that’s been weighing on you. It sounds like there’s regret there. What’s coming up for you as you think about it?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;10;client;I couldn’t help myself.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;11;therapist;It sounds like you’re recognizing that this was a moment where you felt out of control. That’s a really important insight. What do you think might help you feel more in control moving forward?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;12;client;I don’t know. But it’s actually been a fabulous week otherwise.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;13;therapist;That’s great to hear! It sounds like there have been some positive moments despite the challenges. What’s been working well for you this week?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;14;client;I’ve been spending time with the right people. I know who to hang out with—I’m not stupid.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;15;therapist;That’s a really strong point. You’re making intentional choices about who you surround yourself with, and that’s not easy. How has being around those people helped you?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;16;client;They get it. They don’t judge me.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;17;therapist;It sounds like they provide a safe space for you, and that’s so valuable. Having that kind of support can make a big difference.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;18;client;But I’m still letting my whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;19;therapist;It sounds like you’re carrying a lot of guilt about how your family sees you. That’s a heavy burden. What would it mean to you to rebuild that trust or meet their expectations?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;20;client;I don’t know. This is not what I want for my life.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;21;therapist;You’re clear that this isn’t the path you want to stay on. That’s a powerful realization. What do you think your life could look like if you were able to make some changes?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;22;client;I just want to get off this program. I don’t want to be here.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;23;therapist;It sounds like you’re really motivated to move forward and leave this behind. What do you think it would take to get to that point?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;24;client;I don’t know. I still crave smoking, even though I’ve stopped.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;25;therapist;That’s a huge step—stopping smoking—and it’s normal to still have cravings. It takes a lot of strength to resist them. What’s helped you stay strong so far?;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;26;client;I just keep reminding myself why I quit.;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;27;therapist;That’s a great strategy—staying connected to your reasons for change. It sounds like you’re really committed to this, even when it’s hard. What else do you think might help you keep moving forward?;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Let me explain how this session usually goes. We’ll talk for about 20 minutes, and I’ll share some feedback from the questionnaires you completed last week. How does that sound?;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Mm-hmm, that sounds good.;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Great. I’d like to start by hearing your thoughts—where would you like to begin?;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;[sigh] Well, when I was filling out those questionnaires, it felt... weird. I guess I never really thought about my drinking as a big deal.;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;It sounds like the questionnaires made you reflect on your drinking in a new way.;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah, exactly. I mean, I never really kept track of how much I drink. When I had to write it down, it was like... whoa.;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;It seems like seeing the numbers surprised you. What stood out the most?;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;I guess realizing how much I drink on weekends. Like, I thought it was normal, but when I counted, it was a lot.;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;That realization seems to have hit you hard. Can you tell me more about that?;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Well, I thought I drank about the same as my friends. But when I told my roommate I was having, like, 10 drinks over Thursday to Sunday, she was shocked.;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;So your roommate’s reaction added another layer to your realization. How did that feel?;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;It was eye-opening. I thought everyone was doing the same, but I guess not. [chuckles];;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;It sounds like this process has helped you see your drinking in a new light—something you hadn’t considered before.;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah, definitely. It’s kind of weird to think about now.;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;It’s not easy to confront these things, but it’s a big step. How do you feel about what you’ve learned so far?;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;I feel... I don’t know, maybe a little concerned? But also curious about what it means for me.;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;That’s a really honest reflection. It’s okay to feel concerned and curious. Let’s explore that together.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;0;Client;For me.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;1;Therapist;Great! Let’s start by setting some goals. Over the next 30 days, we’ll work together on a few things that matter to you. What’s one area in your life—whether at home, school, or elsewhere—that you’d like to improve?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;2;Client;I need to start getting to school on time for my first class. I always miss it.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;3;Therapist;That sounds like a meaningful goal. Why is getting to school on time important to you?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;4;Client;Mostly because people keep nagging me about it. My mom and my PO are always on my case. If I don’t fix this, I could end up with sanctions, and I really don’t want that.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;5;Therapist;I hear you. Avoiding sanctions and reducing the pressure from others is a big motivator. What would it feel like to show up on time and not have to deal with those consequences?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;6;Client;It’d be a relief, honestly. I wouldn’t have to stress about people getting mad at me all the time.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;7;Therapist;That sounds like a great outcome. Let’s break this down—what do you think is the biggest challenge for you in getting to school on time?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;8;Client;I can’t ever get up in the morning. By the time I wake up, get ready, and head out, I miss the bus. Sometimes I end up walking or trying to find a ride, but it’s always a mess.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;9;Therapist;It sounds like mornings are really tough for you. What do you think would help you get up on time?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;10;Client;I guess I’d need to wake up earlier, but it’s hard because I stay up late. If I could get up by 6:15, I’d have enough time to catch the bus.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;11;Therapist;That’s a good start. What would it take for you to wake up at 6:15?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;12;Client;I’d need to go to bed earlier, but I usually stay up until midnight. Maybe if I tried going to bed by 11:00, it’d be easier.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;13;Therapist;That’s a solid plan. How confident are you that you can stick to an 11:00 bedtime and a 6:15 wake-up?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;14;Client;I’m not sure, but I’m willing to try. I don’t want to deal with the sanctions or the nagging anymore.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;15;Therapist;That’s a great attitude. Trying is the first step. What could help you stick to this plan? For example, who or what could support you in making this change?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;16;Client;My mom could help. She could wake me up if I don’t get up when my alarm goes off.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;17;Therapist;That’s a good idea. Having your mom as a backup could really help. How do you feel about asking her to remind you that this is your goal, not just something she’s pushing you to do?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;18;Client;Yeah, that’d work. It’s my goal, and I want her to remind me of that.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;19;Therapist;Perfect. What about distractions at night? What usually keeps you up until midnight?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;20;Client;My phone, mostly. I get caught up scrolling or watching videos, and before I know it, it’s late.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;21;Therapist;That’s a common challenge. What if you turned off your phone or put it away before bed? How do you think that would help?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;22;Client;It’d probably make a big difference. I could ask my mom to check on me to make sure I’ve put it away.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;23;Therapist;That’s a great strategy. So, to summarize: you’ll aim to go to bed by 11:00, put your phone away, and have your mom support you in waking up at 6:15. How will you know if this plan is working?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;24;Client;If I’m in class when the bell rings, I’ll know it’s working.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;25;Therapist;Exactly. That’s a clear way to measure success. You’ve put together a thoughtful plan, and I’m really impressed by your willingness to try. When would you like to start?;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;26;Client;I’ll start tomorrow.;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;27;Therapist;That’s fantastic. I’m excited for you. Remember, it’s okay if it’s not perfect right away—what matters is that you’re taking steps toward your goal. Let’s check in soon to see how it’s going. You’ve got this!;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;28;Client;Thanks. I’ll give it my best shot.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi Tommy, thanks for coming in today. How have things been going for you lately?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Uh, things are okay, I guess. Just the usual—school, friends, and stuff.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;I see. I wanted to check in with you because I noticed something on social media.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Oh, yeah? What did you see?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;I saw some pictures from a party you were at. How did that go for you?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;It was just a social thing, you know? Everyone was hanging out, having a good time.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;It sounds like you were enjoying yourself. Did anything stand out to you about it?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Well, there was alcohol there, and I had a few drinks. But it wasn’t a big deal.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;I hear you. It sounds like it felt pretty normal in the moment. How do you feel about it now?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I mean, I don’t think it’s a huge problem. It’s just something I do with friends.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;That makes sense. What do you enjoy most about those times with your friends?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I guess it’s just fun to relax and not worry about school or anything for a while.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;It’s great that you have a way to unwind. Have you ever thought about how drinking fits into your life?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Not really. I mean, I know it’s not the best thing, but it’s just what everyone does.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;It’s true—it can feel like part of the social scene. What do you think about the risks of drinking, especially at your age?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;I know there are risks, like getting in trouble or something bad happening. But I feel like I’m careful.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;It sounds like you’re being mindful. What does being careful look like for you?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I don’t drink too much, and I make sure my friends are okay too. I don’t want anyone to get hurt.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;That’s really thoughtful of you. How do you feel about the idea of cutting back or stopping drinking altogether?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;I don’t know. It’s hard to imagine not drinking at all, but I guess I could cut back.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;That’s a great start. What would cutting back look like for you?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Maybe I could skip drinking at some parties or just have one drink instead of more.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;That sounds like a realistic plan. What do you think would help you stick to that?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;I guess I could focus more on school and find other ways to have fun with friends.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Those are great ideas. It sounds like you’re thinking about ways to make positive changes.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Yeah, I think it could be good for me in the long run.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;I’m really glad to hear that. How can I support you as you work on this?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Maybe we could check in every so often to see how it’s going?;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;Absolutely. I’m here to help. Let’s plan to talk again soon and see how things are progressing.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Sounds good. Thanks for listening.;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;Of course, Tommy. I’m proud of you for being open to this conversation. Let’s take it one step at a time.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hi, Jean. I’m Dr. Selby. It’s great to meet you. How are you doing today?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Good morning, doctor. I’m okay, but honestly, I’ve been better.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;I hear that. What’s been on your mind lately?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I was diagnosed with COPD about three months ago, and it’s been really hard.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;That sounds like a lot to process. How has it been for you since the diagnosis?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;5;client;It’s been scary. I haven’t felt well for a while, and I know I need to quit smoking, but it’s so hard.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;It sounds like you’re feeling overwhelmed. What made you decide to come in today?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;7;client;I realized I can’t keep going like this. I need help to quit smoking for good.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;That’s a big step, Jean. What makes quitting smoking important to you right now?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;9;client;My health is getting worse, and I’m scared. I don’t want to end up in the hospital again.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;It sounds like your health is a top priority for you. What else worries you about smoking?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;11;client;It’s expensive, and I’ve noticed it’s affecting my appearance too—my skin, my nails, everything.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;So, it’s impacting your health, your finances, and even how you feel about yourself. That’s a lot.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Yeah, it’s just too much. I know I need to stop, but I don’t know if I can.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;It’s okay to feel unsure. Change is hard. What’s made you feel like you might not be able to quit?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;15;client;I’ve tried before—pills, patches, therapy—but nothing worked. I even quit for a week in the hospital, but I started again right after.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;It sounds like you’ve put in a lot of effort already. What helped you quit during that week in the hospital?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;17;client;I didn’t have a choice—I couldn’t smoke there. But once I got out, it was like I couldn’t stop myself.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;That makes sense. It’s tough when smoking feels like such a big part of your life. What do you enjoy about smoking?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;19;client;It’s been part of my life since I was a teenager. It helps me relax, and it’s something I do with friends and family.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;So, it’s not just a habit—it’s tied to your relationships and how you cope with stress. That’s a lot to let go of.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Exactly. It’s like giving up a part of myself.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;I can see how that feels overwhelming. What would you say is the hardest part about quitting for you?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Probably the social part. Everyone around me smokes, and it’s how we connect.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;That’s a real challenge. What do you think could help you navigate that?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Maybe finding other ways to connect with people, or having someone to support me.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;That’s a great insight. If you had that support, how do you think it would help?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;27;client;I think it would make me feel less alone in this. Like I’m not the only one trying to quit.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;That’s a really good point. Jean, on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is quitting smoking to you right now?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;29;client;It’s a 10. I know I need to do this for my health and my future.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;That’s a strong motivation. And how confident are you, from 1 to 10, that you can quit?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;31;client;Maybe a 4. I want to believe I can, but I’m scared I’ll fail again.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;It’s okay to feel that way. What do you think could help move that confidence from a 4 to a 5 or 6?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Maybe if I had a plan or some tools to help me cope when it gets hard.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;That’s a great idea. Would you be open to trying something small this week, like tracking when and why you smoke?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;35;client;I think I could do that. It might help me understand my triggers better.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;That’s a great start. I can give you a simple tracker to use, and we can review it together next time. How does that sound?;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;37;client;That sounds good. It feels like a small step, but at least it’s something.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Exactly. Small steps lead to big changes. I’m really proud of you for taking this first step, Jean.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Thank you, doctor. I feel a little more hopeful already.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;That’s wonderful to hear. I’ll see you next week, and we’ll take it from there.;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;41;client;Thank you so much. I’ll see you then.;;;
93;high;managing life;0;therapist;So, we’ve touched on a few areas you’d like to work on—physical activity, nutrition, and body confidence. What feels most important to focus on today?;;;
93;high;managing life;1;client;I think starting with physical activity makes the most sense. It feels like the easiest place to start. Nutrition feels a bit overwhelming right now, but if I can get into a routine with activity, it might help me tackle the other stuff later.;;;
93;high;managing life;2;therapist;That sounds like a great plan. Starting with something manageable can build momentum. What’s motivating you to focus on physical activity right now? You’ve mentioned energy and mood—are there other reasons this feels important to you?;;;
93;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah, definitely. I want to feel stronger, you know? Like, last night I struggled to open a jar of salsa, and it was so frustrating. I’d love to feel more capable in little ways like that. Plus, I think being more active would help my body confidence too.;;;
93;high;managing life;4;therapist;That’s a really clear vision—feeling stronger, more capable, and more confident in your body. It sounds like those small, everyday wins, like opening a jar, really matter to you. How about your mood and energy? How do you see those fitting into this?;;;
93;high;managing life;5;client;Oh, for sure. I’ve noticed that when I’m more active, I feel less irritable and more productive. It’s like a domino effect—better energy, better mood, and then I just feel better about myself overall.;;;
93;high;managing life;6;therapist;That’s such a great connection. It sounds like physical activity could be a cornerstone for a lot of positive changes in your life. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is “not ready at all” and 10 is “totally ready,” where would you say you are right now in terms of starting this change?;;;
93;high;managing life;7;client;Hmm, I’d say I’m at an 8.;;;
93;high;managing life;8;therapist;An 8—that’s pretty high! What’s keeping you from being at a 6 or lower?;;;
93;high;managing life;9;client;Well, I’ve already thought about all the benefits—better mood, more energy, feeling stronger, and even improving how I see myself. Those things really make me want to get started.;;;
93;high;managing life;10;therapist;It’s amazing how much clarity you have about the benefits. You’ve got a strong vision of what you want—energy, mood, strength, and body confidence. Is there anything else that’s motivating you that we haven’t touched on yet?;;;
93;high;managing life;11;client;Not that I can think of. Those are the big ones for me right now.;;;
93;high;managing life;12;therapist;Got it. It sounds like you’re really clear on your “why.” So, if you’re ready, we can start exploring what this might look like in practice. What kinds of activities do you think you’d enjoy or feel comfortable starting with?;;;
93;high;managing life;13;client;Yeah, I’d love to talk about that. I think starting with something simple, like walking or maybe yoga, could work for me.;;;
93;high;managing life;14;therapist;That’s a great starting point—something simple and enjoyable. Let’s dive into that a bit more. What would make those activities feel doable for you right now?;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;Hi there! Thanks for coming in today. What’s been on your mind lately?;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;Well, I’ve been struggling with something. I’ve been letting someone stay with me, but I think it’s time for them to move out. I just don’t know how to bring it up.;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;That sounds like a tough situation. It’s really kind of you to have opened your home to them. What’s making you feel like it’s time for them to leave?;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;I guess I feel like the transitional period is over. I want my space back, but I’m not great at being assertive. It’s hard for me to say, “Hey, it’s time to go.”;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;It sounds like you’re torn between wanting your space and not wanting to hurt their feelings. What’s that like for you?;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;Yeah, exactly. I care about them, and there’s a part of me that likes having someone around. But another part of me feels like I’m ready to move on. It’s like I’m at war with myself.;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;That makes a lot of sense. It’s not easy to balance those feelings. What do you think would help you feel more confident about having that conversation?;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;I don’t know. Maybe if I reminded myself that I’ve already done a lot for them? I’ve given them time to figure things out, and they have other options now.;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;That’s a great point. You’ve been really supportive, and it sounds like you’ve already helped them get to a better place. What would it mean for you to have your space back?;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;Hmm. I think it would feel freeing. Like I could focus on my own plans and not feel like I’m carrying this extra weight.;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;That sounds really important—having the freedom to focus on yourself. What’s one small step you could take to start moving toward that?;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;client;I guess I could set a clear timeline with them. I’ve already mentioned it a few times, but I haven’t been firm about it.;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;therapist;That sounds like a good plan. How do you think they’d respond if you were more direct about the timeline?;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;client;Honestly, they’d probably be okay with it. They’ve got other places they can go, and I’ve already talked to them about those options.;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;therapist;It sounds like you’ve already laid the groundwork. What’s stopping you from taking that final step?;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;client;I think it’s just guilt. I don’t want to feel like I’m kicking them out, even though I know it’s time.;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;therapist;Guilt can be really hard to work through. But it sounds like you’ve already gone above and beyond to help them. How would it feel to remind yourself that you’ve done your part?;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;client;It would feel good, actually. Like I’m not being selfish—I’m just taking care of myself for once.;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;therapist;"That’s such an important realization. Taking care of yourself isn’t selfish; it’s necessary. How can I support you in taking that next step?";;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;client;Just knowing I’m not being unreasonable helps. I think I’ll talk to them again tomorrow and set a firm date.;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;therapist;That sounds like a solid plan. You’ve got this! And remember, it’s okay to prioritize your own needs. Let me know how it goes.;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;client;Thanks. I feel a lot better about it now. I’ll keep you updated!;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;Hi, Ruth. Thank you for coming in today. How are you feeling?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;Um, okay, I guess. I just... I don’t even know why I’m here anymore. I feel so stuck.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;It sounds like you’re feeling really overwhelmed. Can you tell me more about that?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;I just keep doing the same things, even though I know they’re bad for me. I feel like I’m out of options.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;It sounds like you’re frustrated with yourself and maybe even a little tired of fighting. Is that right?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;Yeah. I just... I don’t have any willpower left. I feel like I’m just a burden to everyone.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;You feel like you’re a burden? That’s a really heavy feeling. Can you tell me more about that?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;It’s just... my mom struggles so much. She’s a single mom, and I feel like if I weren’t here, she’d have one less thing to worry about.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;So you’re carrying a lot of worry for your mom. It sounds like you care about her deeply. But it also sounds like you’re feeling really alone in this.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;Yeah. I just... I don’t know what to do anymore. Sometimes I think about... just ending it.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;That sounds like an incredibly painful place to be. I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. Can we talk about what’s been happening that’s led you to feel this way?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;client;I’ve been cutting myself. It’s like... the pain inside is too much, and hurting myself is the only way I can feel something else.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;therapist;It sounds like the emotional pain feels unbearable, and cutting gives you some relief, even if it’s just for a moment. Is that right?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;client;Yeah. But then I feel even worse afterward. I just feel so... hopeless.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;therapist;That makes sense. It’s like a cycle—you’re trying to cope, but it leaves you feeling even more stuck. What else have you tried to help yourself feel better?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;client;I don’t know. I try to go to school and be a good kid, but it’s hard. I’m not failing, but I’m not doing great either.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;therapist;It sounds like you’re still trying, even when it feels really hard. That takes a lot of strength, Ruth. What do you think keeps you going, even on the toughest days?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;client;I guess... I don’t want to let my mom down. She works so hard for us.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;therapist;It sounds like your love for your mom is a big part of what keeps you going. That’s really powerful. But it also sounds like you’re carrying a lot of guilt. Do you think your mom sees you as a burden?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;client;I don’t know. She never says it, but... I just feel like I am.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;therapist;It’s hard when we feel that way, even if no one else is saying it. What do you think your mom would say if she knew how much you’re struggling right now?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;client;I don’t know. Maybe she’d be sad. She’d probably tell me to stop being so hard on myself.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;therapist;That sounds like she really cares about you. What would it be like to share some of this with her?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;client;I don’t know. I don’t want to make her worry more.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;therapist;That’s understandable. You’re trying to protect her, but it also sounds like you’re carrying this all by yourself. What would it feel like to let someone else help you carry it?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;client;I guess... it might feel a little less heavy.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;therapist;That’s a really important insight, Ruth. You don’t have to do this alone. We’re here to help you find ways to feel better that don’t involve hurting yourself. How does that sound to you?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;client;It sounds... okay. I just don’t know if I can do it.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;therapist;That’s okay. You don’t have to have all the answers right now. Just coming here today and talking about this is a huge step. What’s one small thing you think you could do to take care of yourself this week?;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;client;Maybe... I could try to talk to my mom about how I’m feeling. Just a little.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;therapist;That sounds like a really brave step. And if it feels too hard, we can talk about other ways to start. You’re not alone in this, Ruth. We’ll figure it out together.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;client;Thank you. I think... I feel a little better just talking about it.;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;therapist;I’m really glad to hear that, Ruth. Thank you for trusting me with this. You’re doing important work here, even if it doesn’t feel like it yet. Let’s keep moving forward, one step at a time;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Thank you for coming in today, Katie. How are you feeling about being here?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;I’m okay, I guess. My doctor referred me, so I’m just doing what I’m told.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;I see. It sounds like you’re here because your doctor has some concerns. Can you tell me more about that?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah, he’s worried about my alcohol intake during pregnancy.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;I understand. How do you feel about that concern?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Honestly, I don’t think it’s a big deal. I’ve heard mixed things, and I don’t see the risk.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;So it sounds like you’re not too concerned, but your doctor is. Can you tell me a bit about your drinking habits?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Sure. I usually have a glass of wine with dinner. It’s just a way to relax, and it’s kind of a family tradition.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;I hear that. It’s part of your routine and helps you unwind. Have you thought about how it might affect your pregnancy?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Not really. I’ve seen articles and heard from friends that it’s not a big deal. I think it’s kind of overblown.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;It sounds like you’ve done some research and feel confident in your perspective. What do you think about the idea that there’s no safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;I don’t know. It feels like they’re just repeating the same thing without showing me real evidence.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;So you’re looking for more concrete proof. What would help you feel more convinced?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;I guess if I saw something that clearly showed the risks, I’d take it more seriously.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;That makes sense. Would you be open to looking at some guidelines together?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Sure, I guess.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Great. According to the latest guidelines, there’s no safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy. It’s recommended to avoid it entirely. What are your thoughts on that?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I mean, I’ve heard that before, but I still don’t see the evidence. It’s hard to believe without more proof.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;I hear your skepticism. It’s tough to change your perspective without feeling convinced. How important is it to you to have a healthy baby?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;It’s really important. I want to be a good parent and do everything I can to protect my baby.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;That’s a really strong value. It sounds like being a good parent means making choices that prioritize your baby’s health. How do you feel about aligning your actions with that goal?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;I guess if it’s really necessary, I’d consider cutting back. But I’d need more information and support.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;That’s a great step. What kind of support would help you make that change?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Maybe talking to my partner and finding ways to relax without alcohol. It’s just hard to imagine giving it up completely.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;It’s a big adjustment, and it’s okay to feel that way. What if we explored some alternatives together and worked on a plan that feels manageable for you?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;That sounds helpful. I’d like to learn more and see how I can make it work.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;I’m glad to hear that. Let’s take this step by step. How about we meet again next week to discuss your progress and any questions you have?;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah, that works for me. Thanks for listening and not just telling me what to do.;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Of course, Katie. This is about what works best for you. I’ll see you next week.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Therapist;Well, Mr. Smith, it looks like we’ve got your medication sorted out. How are you feeling about that?;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;Good, yeah. It’s one less thing to worry about.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;That’s great to hear. I did notice your blood pressure is a bit on the higher side today. How does that sit with you?;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;Yeah, I guess it’s not ideal, but I’ve been under a lot of pressure lately.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;That makes sense. Stress can definitely play a role. I wonder if we could take a moment to talk about something related—your weight. How would you feel about that?;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;My weight? Seriously? I mean, I’ve already had to wait 45 minutes just to get in here.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;I hear you. That wait must have been frustrating, especially when you’ve got a busy schedule. I really appreciate you sticking around.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;Yeah, well, I’ve got clients waiting for me, accounts to sort out—it’s not like I can just drop everything.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;Absolutely. It sounds like your time is really precious, and I don’t want to take up more of it than necessary. I just wanted to check in with you about your weight because it can sometimes tie into things like blood pressure and overall health. How does that land for you?;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;I mean, I get it. I know my weight’s not where it should be, but honestly, I don’t have the time to focus on that right now.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;That’s fair. It sounds like you’re juggling a lot, and adding one more thing to the list might feel overwhelming. Can I ask—what’s your biggest concern about your weight at the moment?;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;Well, I know it’s not great for my health. I get out of breath easily, and I’m sure it’s not helping my blood pressure. But between work and everything else, it’s hard to find the energy to do anything about it.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;It sounds like you’re aware of the impact it’s having, but the demands of your life make it tough to prioritize. What would it look like if things were a little different?;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;I guess I’d like to feel healthier, maybe have more energy. But it’s just not that simple. I’m always on the go—grabbing food here and there, no time to cook or exercise.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;I hear that. It’s not easy to make changes when life feels so rushed. Let me ask you this—if you could make one small change that felt manageable, what might that be?;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Client;Hmm. Maybe I could try to cut back on the ready meals. But even that feels like a lot when I’m juggling everything else.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;16;Therapist;That’s a really thoughtful idea. Small steps can make a big difference over time. What would help you feel supported in making that kind of change?;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;17;Client;I don’t know. Maybe if I had a bit more structure or someone to keep me on track. But like I said, time is the biggest issue.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;18;Therapist;Totally understandable. How about this—we could schedule a follow-up in a couple of weeks to check in on how you’re doing? I could also give you some quick tips for healthier eating on the go, if that would help.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;19;Client;Yeah, that might work. But I’d need an early appointment—I can’t afford to wait around again.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;20;Therapist;Of course. How about we book you in for the first slot of the day? That way, you can get in and out without any delays.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;21;Client;That sounds better. I’ll see if I can make it work.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;22;Therapist;Great. And in the meantime, maybe you could think about one or two small changes that feel doable for you. Even something as simple as swapping out one ready meal for a healthier option could be a start.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;23;Client;Yeah, I can try that. Thanks for understanding.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;24;Therapist;Absolutely. I know it’s not easy, but you’re already taking a step by being here today. Let’s touch base in a couple of weeks and see how things are going.;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;25;Client;Okay, sounds good. Thanks.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;0;therapist;Hi, Mike. Thanks for coming in today. I’m Kathy. How are you doing?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;1;client;Hi, Kathy. I’m doing alright, thanks. Nice to meet you.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;2;therapist;I appreciate you taking the time to be here. I know this might not be where you’d choose to spend your afternoon, so thank you for showing up. How are you feeling about being here today?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;3;client;Honestly, I’m not sure what to expect. My lawyer said I needed to come, so here I am.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;4;therapist;That makes sense. It can feel a bit uncertain when you’re not sure what’s ahead. Let’s take this step by step. First, how are you doing physically? I want to make sure you’re feeling okay before we dive into anything.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;5;client;I’m fine, yeah. No issues there.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;6;therapist;Good to hear. So, I understand you’re here because of a recent DUI. Can you tell me a little about what happened?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;7;client;Yeah, I got a DUI a few weeks ago. I was speeding, and I blew a 2.8. It’s my second one, so I guess that’s why I’m here.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;8;therapist;Thanks for sharing that. It sounds like this has been a challenging experience. How have you been feeling since it happened?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;9;client;Honestly, I’ve been stressed. I don’t want to lose my license, and I’m worried about my job. I sell cars, so I need to drive for work.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;10;therapist;That sounds really tough. It’s clear this situation is weighing on you. What have you been thinking about since the DUI?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;11;client;I’ve been thinking I need to be more careful. Maybe not drink as much, or at least not drive if I’ve had anything.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;12;therapist;That’s a really thoughtful reflection. It sounds like you’re considering some changes to avoid being in this situation again. What do you think those changes might look like for you?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;13;client;Well, I’ve thought about calling a cab or having someone else drive if I’m going to drink. Or maybe just not drinking at all when I’m out.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;14;therapist;Those sound like solid plans. It seems like you’ve put a lot of thought into this. What do you think would be the easiest change to start with?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;15;client;Probably just not driving if I’ve had anything to drink. I think that’s the biggest thing.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;16;therapist;That makes sense. It sounds like you’re really focused on keeping yourself and others safe. How confident do you feel about sticking to that plan?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;17;client;I’d say I’m pretty confident. I don’t want to go through this again.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;18;therapist;That’s great to hear. It sounds like you’re motivated to make a change. What do you think might get in the way of sticking to that plan?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;19;client;Maybe my friends. They like to drink, and sometimes they give me a hard time if I’m not joining in.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;20;therapist;That’s a good point. It can be tough when friends are part of the equation. How do you think you could handle that situation if it comes up?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;21;client;I guess I could just tell them I’m not drinking, or maybe I’ll have one and stop. I don’t want to feel left out, but I also don’t want to get in trouble again.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;22;therapist;It sounds like you’re balancing a lot—your friendships and your desire to stay safe. What do you think your friends would say if you told them you’re trying to cut back?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;23;client;They’d probably tease me at first, but they’d get it. They’re my friends, after all.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;24;therapist;That’s a good perspective. It sounds like you trust them to support you, even if it takes a little time. How do you think making these changes might impact your life?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;25;client;I think it’d be better overall. I wouldn’t have to worry about getting in trouble, and I’d feel better about myself.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;26;therapist;That’s a really positive outlook. It sounds like you’re seeing the benefits of making these changes. What’s one small step you could take this week to move in that direction?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;27;client;Maybe I’ll just plan ahead if I’m going out—like, set aside money for a cab or ask a friend to be the designated driver.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;28;therapist;That’s a great plan. It sounds like you’re ready to take action. I’m really impressed by how much thought you’ve put into this. How can I support you as you move forward?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;29;client;I think just having someone to talk to about it helps. It’s good to get it all out there.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;30;therapist;I’m glad you feel that way. You’re doing important work here, Mike. Let’s check in next time and see how things are going. Does that sound good?;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;31;client;Yeah, that works for me. Thanks, Kathy.;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;32;therapist;You’re welcome, Mike. Thanks for being so open today. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Steve, before we wrap up today, I’d like to spend a few minutes discussing your drinking habits. How does that sound?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Sure, I guess. What do you want to know?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Thanks for being open to this. I noticed on the survey you filled out that you mentioned drinking 2-3 times a week, with 3-4 drinks each time. Does that sound about right?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah, that’s accurate. Mostly on weekends.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Got it. I wanted to share that I’m a bit concerned about your drinking level. It can sometimes worsen or even cause health issues, like the anxiety and insomnia you mentioned earlier. Have you ever thought about how drinking might be connected to those?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Not really. I don’t think I drink enough for it to be a problem. If anything, I sleep better when I drink.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;That’s a common belief, and you’re not alone in thinking that. While alcohol might help you fall asleep faster, it can disrupt your sleep later in the night, causing you to wake up around 2 or 3 AM. Does that sound familiar?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Huh. Yeah, I do wake up around then sometimes. I didn’t realize it could be from drinking.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;It’s a tricky effect. Let me show you this chart. For men under 65, low-risk drinking is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than 4 drinks a day. Based on your survey, you’re in the high-risk category. How does that land for you?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Wow, I didn’t realize I was in that category. I don’t think of myself as a heavy drinker.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;It can be surprising to see it laid out like this. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is “I don’t want to change” and 10 is “I’m ready to change,” where would you say you are?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Hmm. I guess I’d say a 5. I mean, I don’t want to put my health at risk, but I also don’t think I’m that bad.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;A 5 is a great starting point. What makes you choose 5 instead of a lower number?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Well, I’m training for a marathon, and I need to be at my best. But I still don’t think I’m a problem drinker.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;That makes sense. Your health and marathon training are important to you, and you were surprised to see where your drinking falls on the chart. What do you think you might want to do about it?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;I guess I could cut back a little. Maybe drink less often or have fewer drinks when I do.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;That’s a thoughtful approach. What would cutting back look like for you?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Maybe limit myself to 3-4 drinks on weekends and cut back to drinking only twice a week.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;That’s a solid plan. Writing it down can help make it feel more concrete. If you were to set a goal for yourself, what would it be?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;I’d say no more than 18 drinks a week.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;That’s a step in the right direction. While 18 is still above the low-risk level, it’s a great start. I’d encourage you to aim for 14 or fewer eventually, but this is a fantastic first step. How do you feel about checking in on this during your next appointment?;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yeah, that sounds good. I’ll give it a try.;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;That’s all we can ask for. I’m really glad you’re open to making these changes, Steve. Let’s see how it goes next month.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;Hi there. Thanks for coming in today. What’s been on your mind lately?;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;Honestly, I’ve been struggling with my criminal history. It’s like no matter how hard I try to move forward, it feels like this shadow is always there, blocking me from becoming who I really want to be.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;That sounds really heavy. It’s like you’re carrying this weight that keeps pulling you back, even though you’re trying so hard to move forward. What’s been the hardest part about it for you?;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;The hardest part? It’s the rejection. I’ve gone back to school, got a degree, and I’m ready to work in a professional setting, but the moment they see that felony on my record, it’s like I’m not even considered.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;That must feel so frustrating—like all your hard work and effort just hits a wall. Can you tell me more about what happens when you apply for jobs?;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;It’s like I’ll have a great interview, everything’s going well, and then they bring up the background check. Once they see the felony, it’s over. It’s like I’m back to square one every time.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;It sounds like you’re caught in this cycle of hope and disappointment. How do you think that’s affecting you emotionally?;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;It’s bringing back a lot of anger and depression. I don’t want to fall back into old habits, but it’s hard to stay positive when it feels like the system is stacked against me.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;You’re really determined not to go back to that old lifestyle, and that’s huge. What’s been helping you stay on track despite all these challenges?;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;I’ve been focusing on school and trying to start my own business. It’s not much yet, but it’s something. I’m also trying to remind myself that I’ve come a long way, even if it doesn’t always feel like it.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;That’s incredible—you’re creating opportunities for yourself even when the doors seem closed. What kind of business are you working on?;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;It’s event planning—corporate events, transportation, things like that. I’m good at organizing and connecting with people, so it feels like a natural fit.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;That sounds like a great way to use your strengths. How does it feel to take control of your career like that?;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;It feels empowering, but it’s also scary. I’m used to relying on others for opportunities, so doing this on my own is a big shift. But I think it’s the right move for me.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;It sounds like you’re really stepping into your own power. What do you think would help you feel more confident as you build this business?;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;I think just having a plan and sticking to it. Maybe connecting with others who’ve been through similar struggles. I’ve heard there are advocacy groups out there, but I haven’t had much luck with them yet.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;That’s a great idea. Have you looked into groups like the John Howard Society or blogs by people who’ve navigated similar challenges? They might have some helpful insights or resources.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;I haven’t, but I’ll definitely check them out. I think hearing from others who’ve made it through this could give me some hope and direction.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;That’s a great mindset. It sounds like you’re not giving up, even when it feels overwhelming. What’s one small step you could take this week to move forward?;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;I think I’ll start by researching those advocacy groups and maybe reaching out to someone who’s been through this. I also want to work on how I talk about my past in interviews—maybe be more upfront about it.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;That sounds like a solid plan. Being upfront could save you a lot of time and energy. How do you feel about practicing that here? We can work on phrasing that feels authentic to you.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;That would be really helpful. I want to be honest but not defensive, you know? I want them to see me for who I am now, not just my past.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;Absolutely. Let’s work on that together. You’ve got so much to offer, and it’s clear you’re committed to building a better future. I’m really impressed by your resilience.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;Thanks. It’s not easy, but I’m trying. I just don’t want to let my past define me anymore.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;24;therapist;And it doesn’t have to. You’re already proving that by taking these steps. Let’s keep working on this together. You’re not alone in this.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;25;client;I appreciate that. It helps to know someone’s in my corner.;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;26;therapist;Always. Let’s schedule our next session and keep building on the progress you’re making. You’re doing great work.;;;
102;low;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Liz. Thanks for meeting with me today. How are you feeling?;;;
102;low;managing life;1;client;I’m okay, just a bit overwhelmed with everything going on.;;;
102;low;managing life;2;therapist;I hear that. It sounds like things have been pretty busy for you lately.;;;
102;low;managing life;3;client;Yeah, they have. It’s been hard to find time for myself.;;;
102;low;managing life;4;therapist;That makes sense. When life gets busy, it can feel like there’s no room for anything else. What’s something you’ve been thinking about lately that you’d like to make time for?;;;
102;low;managing life;5;client;Well… [sighs] I’ve been thinking about working out again. I know I need to do it, but it’s hard to find the motivation.;;;
102;low;managing life;6;therapist;It sounds like working out is important to you, but finding the motivation and time has been a challenge. What makes working out feel important to you right now?;;;
102;low;managing life;7;client;I just know it’s good for me. I feel better when I’m active, and I’ve been feeling kind of sluggish lately.;;;
102;low;managing life;8;therapist;That’s a great insight. You’ve noticed that being active helps you feel better, and you’d like to get back to that. What do you think might be getting in the way right now?;;;
102;low;managing life;9;client;I think it’s mostly my schedule. I’m so busy with work and other things that it feels like there’s no time left.;;;
102;low;managing life;10;therapist;It sounds like time is a big factor. Balancing everything can be really tough. What have you tried so far to make time for working out?;;;
102;low;managing life;11;client;I haven’t really tried much. I keep telling myself I’ll start, but then something comes up, and it just doesn’t happen.;;;
102;low;managing life;12;therapist;It’s not easy to start something new, especially when life feels so full already. What do you think a realistic first step might look like for you?;;;
102;low;managing life;13;client;Maybe just… going once or twice a week? I don’t know if I can do more than that right now.;;;
102;low;managing life;14;therapist;That sounds like a thoughtful approach. Starting small can help build momentum. What would make it easier for you to take that first step?;;;
102;low;managing life;15;client;Maybe if I plan it ahead of time, like putting it on my calendar so I don’t forget.;;;
102;low;managing life;16;therapist;That’s a great idea. Scheduling it can help make it feel more like a priority. How do you feel about trying that this week?;;;
102;low;managing life;17;client;I think I could try that. Maybe just one day to start and see how it goes.;;;
102;low;managing life;18;therapist;That sounds like a really manageable plan. It’s okay to start small and adjust as you go. What would success look like for you after that first workout?;;;
102;low;managing life;19;client;I think just feeling like I did something for myself would be a win.;;;
102;low;managing life;20;therapist;That’s a wonderful way to look at it. Celebrating those small wins can really help build confidence. I’m looking forward to hearing how it goes. Is there anything else you’d like to explore or talk about today?;;;
102;low;managing life;21;client;No, I think that’s it for now. Thanks for listening.;;;
102;low;managing life;22;therapist;Of course, Liz. You’re doing great by just thinking about this and planning your first step. I’m here to support you. Let’s check in next time and see how it went. Take care!;;;
102;low;managing life;23;client;Thanks, you too.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Thanks for sharing the questionnaire with me. Before we dive in, I want to clarify: my role here is to listen, share helpful info, and support your goals—not to judge or tell you what to do. How does that sound?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Yeah, that’s cool.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Great. I noticed you marked drinking alcohol about eight times last year. Could you walk me through what a typical night out with drinks looks like for you?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Uh, mostly parties. I don’t drink at home. Just when friends are around.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Parties are your main spot. What kinds of drinks do you usually go for in those settings?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Vodka mixes, maybe gin and tonics. Beer’s not my thing.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Got it. How many drinks would you say you have in one night?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Maybe four or five? Depends how long the party lasts.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;So it’s spread out over the evening. You also mentioned drinking helps you relax and fit in. What does that “relaxed” feeling do for you?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;It just… takes the edge off. Makes it easier to laugh and not overthink.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;That makes sense. And you noted sometimes forgetting things when drinking—like how many drinks you’ve had or where you are. How does that sit with you now?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Kinda freaks me out. Last time, I hooked up without a condom because we were both wasted.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;That sounds scary. I appreciate you sharing that. Can we zoom in on that experience? How did drinking play into that choice?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;We weren’t thinking. If I’d been sober, I’d’ve insisted on a condom.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Alcohol shifted your priorities in the moment. [Pauses] I want to share something relevant: For teens, even small amounts of alcohol can affect brain development and increase risks like accidents or STDs. How does that connect with your experience?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Totally. I don’t want another pregnancy scare or STD.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;You’re motivated to protect yourself. On one hand, drinking helps you socialize, but on the other, it brings risks you’re not okay with. Where does that leave you?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I need to cut back. Maybe two drinks max at parties.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;That’s a clear goal. On a scale of 1–10, how confident are you about sticking to two drinks?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Like… a 7? My friend Jess would keep me accountable.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;A 7 is solid! What’s already working in your favor to hit that 7?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Jess doesn’t drink much. She’ll call me out if I go overboard.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;Teamwork makes the dream work. What’s one small step you could take next time you’re at a party?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Alternate drinks with water. And leave my cardigan at home so I can’t stay too late.;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Brilliant—setting physical boundaries. Want to revisit this plan in 3–4 weeks to tweak as needed?;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Yeah, let’s do that.;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;Let’s start by hearing how your exercise routine has been since our last session. What’s been working well?;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Since we last spoke, I’ve managed to go to the gym a few times.;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;That’s a solid step forward! What’s motivated you to prioritize that?;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Honestly, I’m already noticing my pants fit better. It feels rewarding.;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;That’s wonderful progress! Beyond the physical changes, what else have you observed?;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;My back pain has lessened, which is a huge relief.;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;Reducing pain is a big win. How has that improvement impacted your daily life?;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;It’s easier to stay active, but I still struggle to go consistently. I wish I could push myself harder, but I know I need to pace myself.;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;It sounds like you’re balancing ambition with self-compassion. What strategies could help you build momentum gradually?;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;Maybe just sticking to a routine without letting distractions derail me. Last week, I only made it on Thursday and Saturday because work was hectic.;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;Even during a chaotic week, you prioritized it twice. What kept you committed on those days?;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;I reminded myself that showing up, even once, was better than skipping entirely.;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;That mindset shift is key. You mentioned feeling discouraged by others at the gym—how does that comparison affect you?;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;Seeing younger people lift more makes me doubt my progress. Logically, I know my goals are different now, but in the moment, it’s tough.;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;It’s natural to compare, but your focus on health over aesthetics is empowering. How does celebrating small wins, like reduced pain, reinforce your motivation?;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;It reminds me why I started. I’ve even cut back on junk food—pausing before grabbing a candy bar and thinking, “Is this worth undoing my gym effort?”;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;That’s insightful! Linking choices to consequences shows real growth. What support do you need to strengthen these habits further?;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;Maybe tracking progress differently—like noting energy levels instead of weight. And reminding myself that consistency matters more than speed.;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;You’ve clearly reflected on what works for you. How can we build on this momentum in our next session?;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;I’d like to set a realistic schedule and revisit my diet adjustments. Our last chat really sparked this change—I’m grateful for that.;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;You’ve taken remarkable ownership of your journey. Let’s explore those goals together. Celebrate how far you’ve come already.;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hi, I noticed Aiden has had several ear infections this past year. How has that been for you and him?;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah… it’s been stressful. He gets so upset, and I feel like I’m failing him.;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;It sounds like you care deeply about his well-being. What have you tried so far to help reduce these infections?;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;3;client;I take him to the doctor every time, but… I don’t know. I even go outside to smoke so he’s not around it.;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;You’ve put in a lot of effort to protect him. Could you share more about how smoking fits into your daily routine?;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;5;client;I’ve tried quitting before, but it’s just… hard. I go outside, but maybe it’s not enough? I don’t want him to suffer because of me.;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;You’re really torn—you want to quit for Aiden, but it feels overwhelming. What do you know about how smoke exposure affects kids?;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;7;client;I’ve heard it’s bad… ear infections, breathing stuff. I hate that my habit might hurt him.;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;It’s clear you love him and want the best. If you could picture a change that would help him, what might that look like?;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;9;client;Maybe… cutting back more? Or quitting entirely. But I don’t even know where to start.;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;It’s okay to feel unsure. What’s one small step you’d feel ready to explore? We could brainstorm options, or I could share what’s helped others.;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;11;client;I’ve heard about patches or groups, but I’m so busy. Maybe talking to my doctor?;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;That’s a thoughtful idea. How can I support you in taking that next step?;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;13;client;If you could send me info on local groups or meds… and maybe check in next time?;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Absolutely. I’ll share resources today, and we can revisit your plan in a week. How does that sound?;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;15;client;Thanks… I think I need this push. I’ll try. For Aiden.;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;You’re doing important work here. Let’s celebrate any progress, okay? I’m here to help, not judge.;;;
108;high;managing life;0;Therapist;Thank you for coming in today, Sarah. I understand from your counselor that you’ve got a lot on your plate. Can you share a bit about what’s been going on?;;;
108;high;managing life;1;Client;Yeah, it’s been a lot. I have a two-year-old son, I work full-time as a server, and I recently started night classes. It’s just been really overwhelming.;;;
108;high;managing life;2;Therapist;That sounds like a lot to juggle. Are you managing all of this as a single mom?;;;
108;high;managing life;3;Client;Yeah, I am. It’s just me and my son.;;;
108;high;managing life;4;Therapist;I can imagine how stressful that must be—raising a toddler, working full-time, and going back to school. What do you feel is the most pressing issue we should focus on today?;;;
108;high;managing life;5;Client;Childcare is probably my biggest challenge right now.;;;
108;high;managing life;6;Therapist;Can you tell me more about that? What’s been happening with childcare?;;;
108;high;managing life;7;Client;My mom usually watches my son, but lately, she’s been canceling last minute. I’ve had to miss work and classes because of it. It’s really stressful.;;;
108;high;managing life;8;Therapist;That sounds really tough. So, your mom’s unreliability is causing you to miss work and school. That must feel really frustrating.;;;
108;high;managing life;9;Client;Yeah, it is. I don’t know what to do.;;;
108;high;managing life;10;Therapist;Outside of your mom, is there anyone else who could help with childcare?;;;
108;high;managing life;11;Client;Well, there’s my sister, but I don’t really trust her with my son. There’s also a neighbor who helped once when my mom canceled. She has a daughter, so she knows what she’s doing.;;;
108;high;managing life;12;Therapist;That’s interesting. It sounds like your neighbor stepped up when you really needed help. How did that go?;;;
108;high;managing life;13;Client;It went well. My son seemed happy, and I didn’t have any concerns when I picked him up.;;;
108;high;managing life;14;Therapist;That’s great to hear. It sounds like she could be a good resource. Have you thought about asking her for more regular help?;;;
108;high;managing life;15;Client;I’ve thought about it, but I don’t know if I can afford to pay her regularly.;;;
108;high;managing life;16;Therapist;That’s a valid concern. What if you could work out a trade? For example, you could cook meals for her and her daughter in exchange for childcare. What do you think?;;;
108;high;managing life;17;Client;Hmm, that’s an interesting idea. I’m actually in culinary school, so cooking is something I enjoy. It might work.;;;
108;high;managing life;18;Therapist;That’s a great skill to leverage. It sounds like you’re open to exploring that. What about other options, like your son’s father? Is he involved at all?;;;
108;high;managing life;19;Client;No, he’s not in the picture.;;;
108;high;managing life;20;Therapist;I see. Well, it sounds like your neighbor could be a good starting point. How many days a week do you need childcare?;;;
108;high;managing life;21;Client;I have class three nights a week—Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.;;;
108;high;managing life;22;Therapist;What if your neighbor could take one of those days, and your mom could handle the others? That might ease the pressure on your mom.;;;
108;high;managing life;23;Client;Yeah, that could work. If my neighbor took one day, it might make my mom more reliable.;;;
108;high;managing life;24;Therapist;That sounds like a solid plan. What would your next steps be to make that happen?;;;
108;high;managing life;25;Client;I’d need to talk to my neighbor first and see if she’s open to the idea. Then I’d let my mom know, so she feels less overwhelmed.;;;
108;high;managing life;26;Therapist;That’s a great approach. You’ve got a clear plan. Now, I noticed your son is almost three. Have you heard of the Head Start program?;;;
108;high;managing life;27;Client;I’ve heard of it, but I don’t know much about it.;;;
108;high;managing life;28;Therapist;Head Start is a high-quality, affordable preschool program designed for families like yours. It could be a great option for your son when he turns three. Would you like more information about it?;;;
108;high;managing life;29;Client;Yeah, that sounds like it could really help.;;;
108;high;managing life;30;Therapist;Great. I’ll get you some details. Now, I also saw you’re working on reducing smoking and drinking. How’s that going?;;;
108;high;managing life;31;Client;It’s been harder than I thought. Some days I do well, but other days I struggle, especially in the evenings.;;;
108;high;managing life;32;Therapist;It’s great that you’re committed to making a change. Have you thought about how secondhand smoke might affect your son?;;;
108;high;managing life;33;Client;Yeah, I never smoke around him. I always go outside.;;;
108;high;managing life;34;Therapist;That’s really thoughtful of you. It’s clear you’re doing your best for your son. Let’s recap: we’ve discussed childcare options with your neighbor and Head Start, and you’re working on reducing smoking. What do you see as your next steps?;;;
108;high;managing life;35;Client;I’ll talk to my neighbor and my mom, and I’ll look into Head Start.;;;
108;high;managing life;36;Therapist;That’s a solid plan. How about we meet again in two weeks to check in on your progress? If you hit any bumps, we’ll figure it out together.;;;
108;high;managing life;37;Client;That sounds good.;;;
108;high;managing life;38;Therapist;Great. Thank you for sharing so openly today, Sarah. You’re doing an amazing job balancing everything. I look forward to hearing how things go.;;;
108;high;managing life;39;Client;Thanks. I appreciate your help.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Great news—no cavities today! Always a relief to hear that.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Oh, that’s wonderful!;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Definitely. However, I did notice some irritation on the roof of your mouth. It’s called nicotinic stomatitis, which is often linked to tobacco use. How does tobacco fit into your life right now?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Tobacco? Well, I don’t smoke cigarettes—never have. But, um, when I go out with friends, we might have a few drinks and smoke those little cigarillos. They’re not even real cigars, and I only have one or two in an evening. It’s not like I’m smoking packs a day or anything.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;It sounds like you’ve made a conscious choice to avoid cigarettes, which is great. But these cigarillos—how often would you say you’re smoking them?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Oh, just socially. Maybe one or two when I’m out with friends. It’s not a habit or anything.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;So it’s more about the social connection than the smoking itself?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Exactly. It’s just something we do together. It’s not like I need it.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;I hear you. It’s more about the experience and being part of the group. Have you noticed any changes in how often you’re smoking lately?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Well… now that you mention it, I’ve started having one or two during work breaks. A couple of my coworkers smoke, so I join them outside. I’ve been trying these peach-flavored Swisher Sweets—they’re kind of fun.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;So it’s become part of your routine, both socially and at work. What do you enjoy most about it?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;11;client;It’s relaxing, and I like being with people. When we go to Vegas, for example, it feels sophisticated to visit cigar bars. It’s just a fun thing to do.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;That makes sense. It sounds like it’s tied to a lot of positive experiences. On the other hand, have you noticed any downsides to smoking?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, my teeth are getting stained, and I was actually going to ask about whitening them. I’m guessing the smoking has something to do with that.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Yes, smoking can definitely cause staining. Are there any other concerns you’ve noticed, like with your health or finances?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Yeah, the cost adds up. With the economy being what it is, I’ve been trying to save, and this is an extra expense I hadn’t really thought about.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;So there’s the financial aspect, the staining, and now this irritation in your mouth. Were you aware that cigarillos can have similar health risks to cigarettes?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Wait, really? I had no idea. I always thought of them as harmless—just a fun thing to do with friends.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;It’s a common misconception. Cigarillos can still expose you to nicotine and other harmful chemicals. How does it feel to realize that?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Honestly, I’m a little shocked. I never thought of myself as a smoker. I even checked “No” on your form when you asked about tobacco use.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;That’s a big realization. How do you feel now, knowing that this might be affecting your health?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;21;client;I’m really concerned. I don’t want to develop lung cancer or any of those awful diseases. I had no idea this was even a possibility.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;I understand. The good news is, if you decide to quit, your body can start healing right away. The irritation in your mouth can reverse, and you’ll reduce your risk of other health issues. Is quitting something you’d consider?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Absolutely. I’d really like to quit. I just didn’t realize I needed to until now.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;That’s a great step. On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is “not at all confident” and 10 is “completely confident,” how confident are you that you could quit if you tried?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;25;client;I’d say a 7 or 8. It’s not a huge part of my life, so I feel like I could stop if I really put my mind to it.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;That’s a strong starting point. What makes you feel confident about it?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Well, I don’t smoke every day, and I don’t feel like I need it. It’s more about the social aspect, so I think I could cut it out if I tried.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;It sounds like you’ve got a good sense of what’s driving your smoking and how you might approach quitting. What do you think would help you take the next step?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;29;client;I’d like to learn more about quitting—like if there are medications or strategies to make it easier. I really want to do this.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;I’d be happy to help with that. We can explore options like nicotine replacement therapy, counseling, or support groups. Would you like to start by setting a goal or timeline?;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;31;client;Yes, that would be great. I’d like to quit within the next month.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;That’s a fantastic goal. Let’s work together to create a plan that feels manageable for you. I’m really glad we had this conversation today.;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Thank you. I feel so much more aware now, and I’m ready to make a change.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;0;therapist;Hi, are you Katie?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;1;client;Yeah.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;2;therapist;Hi, I’m Beth. I work with Mrs. Smith, the nurse practitioner you just saw. Do you have a few minutes to chat?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;3;client;Uh, sure. What’s this about?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;4;therapist;I noticed you filled out a healthy habits questionnaire while waiting for your appointment. You mentioned some things about marijuana use—would it be okay if we talked about that?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;5;client;Sure, I guess.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;6;therapist;Great. I see you use marijuana regularly. I’d love to hear more about how it fits into your life. How does it help you?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;7;client;Well, it’s legal here now, so it’s not a big deal. I’m not in trouble, am I?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;8;therapist;Not at all! This isn’t about getting you in trouble. I’m just curious about how it works for you. Can you tell me more about how you use it?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;9;client;It’s just a couple of times a week to relax. I’ve got a lot going on—school, debate team, you know.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;10;therapist;It sounds like you’re juggling a lot. You’re on an academic scholarship and involved in debate—that’s impressive. How does marijuana help with all that?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;11;client;I guess it helps me unwind. I’m the first in my family to go to college, and it’s kind of overwhelming sometimes.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;12;therapist;That’s a big responsibility. It sounds like marijuana helps you manage the stress of such a big transition. Are there other ways it’s helpful for you?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;13;client;I don’t know. Sometimes when I’m with friends, it feels like it helps me fit in. But I’m not sure it really does.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;14;therapist;So it sounds like it helps you relax, but when it comes to fitting in with your peers, it might not be working as well as you’d hoped. Is that right?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;15;client;Yeah, I guess so.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;16;therapist;What about the downsides? Are there any challenges or concerns that come with using marijuana?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;17;client;I mean, I’m always worried about getting caught. My parents would freak out if they knew. And I don’t really have the money for it—I usually just bum it off my roommate.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;18;therapist;So it sounds like there’s some stress around using it—worries about your family finding out, financial strain, and maybe even some embarrassment. Does that feel accurate?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;19;client;Yeah, that’s pretty much it.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;20;therapist;Katie, it seems like marijuana helps you relax, but it’s also creating some stress in other areas of your life. Given all that, what do you think you’d like to do about your use?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;21;client;I don’t know. When you put it that way, it doesn’t seem like the best habit.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;22;therapist;Would it be okay if I shared an idea?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;23;client;Sure.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;24;therapist;You mentioned earlier that you’ve always dealt with anxiety. Have you ever considered talking to a counselor about that?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;25;client;No, not really. My family doesn’t really believe in that kind of thing.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;26;therapist;Can you tell me more about that?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;27;client;It’s just not something we do. They think it’s for people who are really messed up, and we definitely can’t afford it.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;28;therapist;I hear that. It sounds like there’s a lot of stigma around counseling in your family, and cost is a concern too. But here at the college, counseling is free, and it’s completely confidential. We wouldn’t share anything with your parents unless there was a serious safety concern.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;29;client;Really? It’s free?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;30;therapist;Yes, absolutely. And it’s a safe space to talk about things like stress, anxiety, or even just figuring out how to navigate college life. A lot of students find it really helpful. What do you think?;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;31;client;I don’t know. I guess I’d think about it.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;32;therapist;That’s totally okay. How about this—on our way out, I can show you where the counseling center is. No pressure to go in, but it might help to know where it is in case you ever want to check it out.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;33;client;Okay, that sounds good.;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;34;therapist;Great! Let’s head over there now.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Chris, I wanted to check in with you. You’re one of our star athletes, and I really value you as part of the team. As Athletic Director, I like to make sure everyone is performing at their best. I heard about a party this weekend, and I understand you were there. Can we talk about how alcohol and partying fit into your life right now?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Yeah, sure. Actually, there’s something I’ve been wanting to confide in someone about. Before the party, I’ve always been this honor student, and my parents have kept me pretty sheltered from social stuff.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Mm-hmm. That sounds like a lot of pressure. Can you tell me more about how that’s been for you?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Well, about a month ago, my friends invited me to a party. They kept saying, “You’re always studying, you need to live a little.” So, I convinced my parents I was staying at a friend’s house, and that’s when I started drinking.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;I see. So, that was your first experience with drinking? How did that feel for you?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;It was... different. I guess it was fun in the moment. I felt more relaxed, like I could finally let loose. But now, looking back, I’m not sure it was worth it.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;It sounds like it was a mix of fun and maybe some uncertainty. What’s been happening since then?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Well, this past weekend, I skipped studying for an exam to go to another party. My mom made me promise no alcohol, but I broke that promise. She knew as soon as I got in the car. I felt terrible—like I betrayed her trust.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;That sounds like a tough situation. How has that been affecting you?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;It’s been weighing on me. I’ve been feeling more lethargic, and my focus on schoolwork has dropped. I’ve also noticed I’m hanging out with different friends now—people who are more into the party scene.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;It sounds like a lot has changed in a short time. What do you like about drinking, and what’s been less enjoyable?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I like that it helps me relax and feel less self-conscious. But the downsides—like losing focus, disappointing my mom, and feeling sick—are starting to outweigh the fun.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;It sounds like you’re really reflecting on this. How important is it for you to make a change?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;It’s really important. I want to rebuild trust with my mom, get back on track with school, and focus on my athletics. I don’t want to lose sight of what matters most to me.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;That’s a great insight. On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you can make this change?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;I’d say an 8 or 9. I’m determined to fix this, but I know it won’t be easy.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;That’s a strong number. What makes you feel so confident?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I don’t like how I’ve been feeling—guilty about my mom, unfocused in school, and physically sick after drinking. I know I can do better.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;It sounds like you have a clear vision of what you want. What do you think is a realistic goal for you moving forward?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;I want to stop drinking altogether, or at least limit it to one drink if I’m at a party. My main focus is rebuilding trust with my mom and getting back on top of my studies and sports.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;That’s a solid plan, Chris. I really appreciate you opening up about this. It’s clear you’ve thought this through, and I’m here to support you. How can I help you stay on track?;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Thanks for listening. It means a lot. I think just having someone to talk to and hold me accountable will help.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;Absolutely, Chris. I’m here for you. Let’s check in again soon to see how things are going. You’ve got a lot of potential, and I’m confident you can make this work.;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Thanks. I’ll do my best.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hi, Sandra. Thanks for making the time to talk today. How are you doing?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Hi. I’m okay, I guess. Just a lot going on with my daughter in the hospital.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;I can imagine this is a stressful time for you. What’s been on your mind lately?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I’ve been thinking about quitting smoking, but I’m not sure I’m ready.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;It sounds like quitting is something you’ve been considering, but it feels like a big step right now. What makes you think about quitting?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;5;client;I feel like I’m setting a bad example for my kids, especially my daughter. She’s 12, and some of her friends are already trying cigarettes. I don’t want her to start.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;It sounds like being a good role model for your daughter is really important to you. Can you tell me more about that?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Yeah, I smoked when I was young, and I don’t want her to go down that path. But at the same time, I enjoy smoking. It’s hard to imagine giving it up.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;I hear you. Smoking feels like a part of your life, and it’s not easy to think about letting it go. What do you enjoy most about smoking?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;9;client;It’s relaxing, especially after a long day. And at work, it’s a way to socialize with my coworkers. I’d feel left out if I stopped.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;So it’s a way to unwind and connect with others. What else do you like about it?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Hmm, I also use it to manage my weight. After meals, it helps me feel like I’m done eating. Sometimes I’ll smoke instead of snacking.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;It sounds like smoking serves a lot of purposes for you—relaxation, socializing, even managing your weight. That’s a lot to consider. What about the other side? What are some of the downsides of smoking for you?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, I worry about my health, and I feel guilty about my kids seeing me smoke. Just this morning, my daughter was watching me smoke through the window, and it made me feel awful.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;That sounds like a powerful moment. How did it feel to see her watching you?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;15;client;It was really hard. I want to be a good parent, but I feel like I’m failing her.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;It’s clear that being a good parent is a top priority for you. How do you think smoking fits into that goal?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;17;client;It doesn’t fit. I know it’s not good for me or for them, but it’s just so hard to quit.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;It sounds like there’s a real tension between what you value as a parent and what smoking provides for you. What would it take for quitting to feel more possible for you?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;19;client;I don’t know. I’m not ready to quit right now, but I do think about it.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;That’s okay. It’s good that you’re thinking about it. What would need to change for quitting to feel like a priority?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;21;client;I guess if I had more support or a plan, maybe it would feel less overwhelming.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;That makes sense. Would you be open to exploring some small steps together?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Yeah, I think so.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Great. Before we wrap up, I’d like to give you a small exercise to think about over the next week. Would you be willing to write down your top three reasons for considering quitting, as well as what you enjoy and don’t enjoy about smoking?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Okay, I can try that.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Perfect. Thanks for being so open today, Sandra. Let’s meet again next week and see where you’re at. How does that sound?;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Sounds good. Thanks for listening.;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;You’re welcome. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Dylan, I see from the Minnesota State Mankato security report that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence, and transported to detox. The report also lists your age as 20. How accurate is this report, and can you share what led up to the incident?;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Yeah, that sounds about right. It happened a week ago. I was at my friend’s place watching the game, and we had a few beers. When the Vikings started losing, we ended up drinking more than usual. I couldn’t find a ride home, so I drove myself.;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;It sounds like the game didn’t go as planned, and that led to drinking more than you intended. When you couldn’t find a ride, you made the decision to drive. Did I understand that correctly?;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Yeah, that’s exactly what happened. I’m just a normal college kid hanging out with friends. It wasn’t a big party or anything, but I still got busted.;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;I hear that you were just trying to have a good time with your friends. It sounds like you didn’t expect things to go this way, especially since you weren’t at a big party. You even tried to find a ride home. What do you think went wrong in that situation?;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;I guess I didn’t think about the consequences. I mean, my friends drink all the time and never get caught. I just had bad luck.;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;It sounds like you feel this happened because of bad luck. If things stay the same and you don’t make any changes, what do you think might happen in the future?;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;I guess I could get in more trouble with the police or the school. I don’t have the time or money for that. Going to detox was awful, and my dad said if I get suspended, I’ll have to work on my uncle’s farm in Iowa. That would ruin my social life and my plans for college.;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;It sounds like avoiding future problems is really important to you. What steps do you think you could take to prevent something like this from happening again?;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I guess I could drink less and avoid situations where I’m more likely to get in trouble. Maybe I should only drink at home or wait until I’m 21. Or find other things to do that don’t involve drinking.;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;That sounds like a thoughtful plan. On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you can follow through with it, with 10 being very confident?;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I’d say about a 6. I’m halfway there, but I’m not totally sure.;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;What could you do to move that 6 to a 7 or 8?;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Maybe I could set some rules for myself, like only drinking at home or finding other activities. There’s got to be more to do in this town than just drinking.;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;How do you think your life might improve if you succeed in making these changes?;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;I’d probably feel better overall—no more hangovers, and I’d actually make it to my 8:00 AM classes. In high school, I had a 3.5 GPA, so I know I can do well if I focus.;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;It sounds like education and your future are really important to you. How do your beliefs and values align with the decisions you’re planning to make about drinking?;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Education and my family mean a lot to me. I want to be an international journalist, and I know drinking too much is getting in the way of that. If I reprioritize, I can make my parents proud and get the education I need.;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;Thanks for sharing all of this, Dylan. As part of your sanction, you’ll be placed on university disciplinary probation and need to attend an alcohol education seminar, which costs $150. How do you feel about that?;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;All right. When is the seminar?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Hi David, how are you feeling today?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;1;Client;I’m okay, I guess. Just here to get my teeth fixed.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;I understand. Your oral health is important, and I’m here to help with that. How’s everything else been going?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;3;Client;It’s been alright. Just the usual stuff.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;Got it. So, while we’re looking at your teeth, I noticed some staining. Do you have any thoughts about that?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;5;Client;Yeah, I know. It’s probably from smoking and coffee. I’ve heard it before.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;It sounds like you’re aware of the connection. How do you feel about that?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;7;Client;I mean, I know it’s not great, but it’s hard to change.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;It’s definitely not easy to make changes, especially with habits like smoking. What’s been your experience with trying to cut back or quit?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;9;Client;I’ve tried before. Did the pills, but they didn’t work. Just gave me side effects.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;That sounds frustrating. It’s not uncommon for people to try a few times before finding what works. What did you learn from that experience?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;11;Client;I guess I learned it’s harder than I thought. Everyone keeps telling me to quit, but it’s not that simple.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;It can feel overwhelming when it seems like everyone is giving advice. What would make it feel more manageable for you?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;13;Client;I don’t know. I just don’t want to feel pressured, you know?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;Absolutely. This is about what works for you, not about pressure. What’s something small that you feel ready to explore?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;15;Client;Maybe cutting back a little. But I’m not sure.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;That’s a great start. Cutting back can be a step in the right direction. What would support look like for you in doing that?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;17;Client;I guess having someone to talk to without feeling judged.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;I’m here for that. We can work together on this at your pace. How does that sound?;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;19;Client;Yeah, that’s okay. I appreciate it.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;Of course. And remember, it’s about progress, not perfection. Let’s take it one step at a time.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;21;Client;Alright. Thanks for understanding.;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;Anytime, David. Let’s keep the conversation going next time. Take care.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;0;Therapist;Molly, thank you so much for coming in today. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;1;Client;You’re welcome. I guess I needed to talk about some stuff anyway.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;2;Therapist;Of course. I’m here to listen. Your mom mentioned that you’ve been having some trouble at school—kids being mean, bullying, things like that. How’s that been for you?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;3;Client;It’s been really hard. I’ve already stayed home twice because of it. I just couldn’t deal with it.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;4;Therapist;That sounds really tough. Missing school because of how others are treating you—that’s a lot to handle. Can you tell me more about what’s been happening?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;5;Client;Yeah. Like, when I stayed home, rumors started spreading that I was in the principal’s office with security guards escorting me to class. But I wasn’t even there—I was at home!;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;6;Therapist;That must have been so frustrating—people making up stories about you when you weren’t even there. How did that make you feel?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;7;Client;It made me really mad. I’ve been getting blamed for stuff since fifth or sixth grade. It’s like I’m an easy target or something.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;8;Therapist;You feel like you’re an easy target. Can you tell me more about that? What makes you think that?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;9;Client;I think it’s because I don’t let things go. Like, if someone says something to me, I keep talking back instead of walking away. I guess they know they can get a reaction out of me.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;10;Therapist;So, when you engage with them, it tends to escalate things. What happens when you don’t walk away?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;11;Client;It just gets worse. The conversation gets bigger, and then we both end up in trouble—like getting called to the principal’s office.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;12;Therapist;That sounds like a tough cycle to be in. But I noticed you mentioned something earlier—about a time when you walked away. Can you tell me about that?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;13;Client;Yeah, there was this one time when someone was talking about me, and I just said, “This is lame, I’m leaving,” and I walked away. I felt really proud of myself.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;14;Therapist;That’s amazing, Molly. Walking away in that moment took a lot of strength. What helped you do that?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;15;Client;I thought about my mom. She always tells me to just let it go, but I usually don’t listen. This time, I thought about how she’d feel if I got in trouble again, and I just walked away.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;16;Therapist;That’s really insightful. You were able to think ahead and make a different choice. It sounds like you’re starting to find ways to break that cycle. How did it feel afterward?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;17;Client;It felt good. Like, I didn’t get in trouble, and the other kids just stopped talking to me. It was kind of a win.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;18;Therapist;That’s a huge win. It sounds like you’re learning what works for you. What other strategies have you thought about trying?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;19;Client;I’ve been thinking about just walking away more often. Or, if I’m in class and things get tense, I’ll ask to go to the bathroom or something to cool off.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;20;Therapist;Those are great ideas. It sounds like you’re really thinking about how to take care of yourself in those moments. Have you tried any of those yet?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;21;Client;Yeah, actually. In gym class, there’s this girl who always tries to start stuff with me. I asked the teacher to move me to a different court, and it worked. I didn’t have to deal with her at all.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;22;Therapist;That’s such a smart move. You recognized a potential problem and took steps to avoid it. How did that feel?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;23;Client;It felt good. Like, I was in control for once. I didn’t let her get to me.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;24;Therapist;That’s a big step, Molly. It sounds like you’re starting to figure out what works for you. And it’s okay if it takes time—this isn’t easy stuff.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;25;Client;Yeah, it’s definitely not easy. But I’m trying.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;26;Therapist;And that’s what matters. You’re trying, and you’re making progress. I’m really proud of you for that. How do you feel about where you’re at right now?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;27;Client;I feel like I’m getting better at handling things. But it’s still hard, especially with all the rumors and drama.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;28;Therapist;It is hard. High school can be really tough, especially when people are being mean for no reason. But you’re not alone in this. Do you have friends who support you?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;29;Client;Yeah, I have a few really good friends. They’re the ones who don’t believe the rumors and actually stick up for me.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;30;Therapist;That’s so important—having people who have your back. How do you know you can trust them?;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;31;Client;They’re the ones who text me, hang out with me, and help me when things get bad. They don’t just believe everything they hear.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;32;Therapist;That’s a great way to tell who your real friends are. It sounds like you’ve got a good sense of who’s there for you.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;33;Client;Yeah, I think so. But it’s still hard to know who to trust sometimes.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;34;Therapist;That’s completely understandable. Trust takes time, especially when you’ve been hurt before. But it sounds like you’re doing a great job figuring it out.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;35;Client;Thanks. I’m trying.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;36;Therapist;And that’s what counts. Molly, I’d love to keep working with you on this. Would you be open to meeting again? Maybe we can even bring in one of your friends if you think that would help.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;37;Client;Yeah, I think that would be good. There’s one friend who might want to talk too—she’s going through some similar stuff.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;38;Therapist;That’s a great idea. We can definitely make that happen. For now, though, I just want to say how impressed I am with how you’re handling everything. High school is tough, but you’re showing a lot of strength.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;39;Client;Thanks. That means a lot.;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;40;Therapist;Of course. You’re doing great, Molly. Let’s keep building on that.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, it’s great to see you again. What’s been on your mind lately?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;I’ve been struggling with my drinking. It’s gotten out of hand, and I think I need help.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;I hear you. It sounds like this is something that’s been weighing on you. Can you tell me more?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah, it’s been worse over the last six months. I used to drink socially, but now it’s almost every day.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;That sounds like a big shift. What do you think has contributed to this change?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Well, I broke up with my boyfriend about a year ago, and six months ago, I started going out more to meet people. Drinking just became part of that.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;I see. So, drinking became a way to cope with social situations and meeting new people?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Exactly. It helps me feel less nervous, but now I’m drinking even on weeknights, which I never used to do.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;It sounds like drinking has become a way to manage your nerves, but it’s also starting to feel like too much. Is that right?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Yeah, it’s not even working anymore. I end up too drunk to really connect with anyone, and then I’m just hungover the next day.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;That’s a tough spot to be in. On one hand, it helps you feel more comfortable, but on the other, it’s not giving you the results you want.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Yeah, and it’s affecting other parts of my life too. I’m not eating well, I’ve stopped exercising, and I just feel stuck.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;It sounds like you’re noticing how this is impacting your health and lifestyle. What would you like to change?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;I want to cut back, especially during the week. I don’t want to stop completely, but I need to get it under control.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;That makes sense. It sounds like you’re looking for balance—keeping the social aspect but reducing the negative impacts.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Yeah, exactly. I don’t want to lose my social life, but I also don’t want to feel like this anymore.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;It’s great that you’re thinking about balance. On a scale from 0 to 100, how important is it for you to cut back on drinking?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I’d say 80. It’s really important to me right now.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;That’s a high number. What makes it an 80 instead of something lower?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;I just feel like it’s gotten to a point where I can’t ignore it anymore. It’s affecting too much of my life.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;It sounds like you’re ready to take action. What do you think might be a good first step?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;I think starting with weekdays. If I can stop drinking during the week, that would be a big change.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;That sounds like a solid plan. How do you feel about setting that as your first goal?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;I feel good about it. It’s realistic, and I think I can do it.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;That’s great to hear. It sounds like you’re motivated and ready to make a change. What support do you think you’ll need to make this happen?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;I think just having someone to talk to, like you, and maybe finding other ways to relax during the week.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Those are great ideas. We can definitely work on strategies together. How do you feel about where we’re headed?;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;I feel hopeful. Talking about it makes me feel like I can actually do this.;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;That’s wonderful. You’re taking a big step by being here and being open to change. Let’s keep working on this together.;;;
119;high;managing life;0;Therapist;Thanks for coming in today. How have things been since we last met?;;;
119;high;managing life;1;Client;Well, I did get an interview for a job, but… I couldn’t go. I didn’t have anyone to watch my kids.;;;
119;high;managing life;2;Therapist;That sounds really tough. It must have been disappointing to have to cancel.;;;
119;high;managing life;3;Client;Yeah, it was. It felt like a missed opportunity. The job seemed like a good fit, but my kids come first.;;;
119;high;managing life;4;Therapist;Absolutely, your kids are your priority. How did it feel to have to make that choice?;;;
119;high;managing life;5;Client;Frustrating, honestly. I worry this will keep happening—missing chances because of childcare.;;;
119;high;managing life;6;Therapist;It sounds like childcare is a big barrier for you. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it for you to find a job right now?;;;
119;high;managing life;7;Client;It’s a 10. I’m the only one supporting my kids, and what I’m getting now just isn’t enough.;;;
119;high;managing life;8;Therapist;It’s clear how much this matters to you. And how confident are you, on that same scale, about finding a job?;;;
119;high;managing life;9;Client;Maybe a 3. Even if I get childcare, my resume isn’t great—gaps in work, not much education. I don’t feel very employable.;;;
119;high;managing life;10;Therapist;It sounds like childcare and confidence in your resume are the two big challenges. What would it take to move that confidence from a 3 to a 5?;;;
119;high;managing life;11;Client;Reliable childcare would help. And maybe some training or certifications to feel better about my skills.;;;
119;high;managing life;12;Therapist;That makes sense. What kind of training or certifications are you thinking about?;;;
119;high;managing life;13;Client;Something quick, like computer skills. I don’t have time for a long program, but I need something to help me get started.;;;
119;high;managing life;14;Therapist;So, short-term training that could lead to steady work—something that fits your immediate needs.;;;
119;high;managing life;15;Client;Exactly. Even if it’s not my dream job, it would help me get on my feet.;;;
119;high;managing life;16;Therapist;That’s a practical approach. Let’s break it down: childcare first, then training. What’s one small step you could take this week to start addressing childcare?;;;
119;high;managing life;17;Client;I could look into local childcare resources or ask around for recommendations.;;;
119;high;managing life;18;Therapist;That’s a great start. And what about training? Any ideas on where to begin?;;;
119;high;managing life;19;Client;Maybe I could check out community programs or online courses for basic computer skills.;;;
119;high;managing life;20;Therapist;Those are solid steps. How can I support you in moving forward with these plans?;;;
119;high;managing life;21;Client;Just having someone to talk through this with helps. I’ll start looking into childcare and training options this week.;;;
119;high;managing life;22;Therapist;You’re taking important steps, and I’m here to support you. Let’s check in next time on how it’s going.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Therapist;I’m really glad we could address that issue today. How are you feeling about everything we’ve discussed so far?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;Thanks, doctor. I feel a bit relieved. I’ll try to take it easy for the next few days.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;That sounds like a good plan. Since we have a little time left, I’d like to touch on something else if that’s okay with you. I’ve noticed your blood pressure and weight have been gradually increasing over the past few years. Would you be open to discussing this?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;Yeah, I guess so. I know my weight’s been an issue, but every time I try to do something about it, I end up back where I started. It’s really frustrating.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;I hear you. Weight management can feel like an uphill battle, especially when life gets busy. How about we explore this together and see if we can find some small, manageable steps that work for you?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;That sounds good, but I’m not sure where to start. Work is crazy, and with the kids, it feels like there’s no time for anything else.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;That’s completely understandable. Life can get overwhelming. Maybe we can focus on one small change that fits into your routine. What do you think?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;Okay, I’m willing to try. What do you suggest?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;One of the most effective ways to improve health and manage weight is through physical activity. It doesn’t have to be intense—just moving more can make a big difference. Are there any activities you enjoy or used to enjoy?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;I like walking, but I don’t know if it’s enough to make a difference.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;Walking is actually a fantastic way to start! Even short walks can have a positive impact on your health. Plus, it’s something you can do almost anywhere. Do you think you could fit a short walk into your day?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;Hmm, maybe. There’s a park near my office—I could take a walk there after work.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;That’s a great idea! And you know, walking can be a nice way to unwind after a busy day. How does that sound to you?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;Yeah, I think I could do that. Actually, I used to love dancing, but I haven’t done it in years.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;Dancing is such a fun way to stay active! It’s great for your body and your mood. Do you think you’d like to explore that again?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Client;I’d love to! My family would probably support me too. Maybe I could find a class or something.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;16;Therapist;That’s wonderful to hear. Having support from your family can make a big difference. Would you like to look into local dance classes or even dance fitness programs?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;17;Client;Yeah, I think I’d really enjoy that. I’m kind of excited about the idea now!;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;18;Therapist;That’s fantastic! Small steps like walking and dancing can add up over time. Another idea is to incorporate more movement into your daily routine—like taking the stairs or parking a little farther away. What do you think?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;19;Client;I can definitely do those things. They seem simple enough.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;20;Therapist;Exactly. Small changes can lead to big results. Let’s start with these steps and check in during your next appointment to see how it’s going. Does that work for you?;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;21;Client;Yeah, that sounds good. What about diet, though? That’s always the hard part.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;22;Therapist;Diet is important, but it doesn’t have to be overwhelming. We can take the same approach—small, manageable changes that fit into your life. For now, let’s focus on adding movement and see how that goes.;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;23;Client;Okay, I like that plan. I’ll start with walking and look into dancing. Thanks, doctor!;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;24;Therapist;You’re welcome! I’m really excited for you. Let’s schedule a follow-up in a few weeks to see how things are going. You’ve got this;;;
121;high;diabetes management;0;Therapist;Welcome! My name is Mark, and I work here at Green Prescriptions. How are you doing today?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;1;Client;Thank you. I’m doing alright, just a bit surprised to be here, honestly.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;2;Therapist;I can understand that. I’ve got a bit of background from your GP, but I’d love to hear from you—what’s brought you in today?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;3;Client;Well, my GP said I might have Type 2 diabetes. It was a bit of a shock, to be honest.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;4;Therapist;That does sound like a lot to take in. How did you feel when you first heard that?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;5;Client;I thought he was joking! I mean, I feel fine. I don’t fit the “diabetes look,” you know? I’m not overweight or anything.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;6;Therapist;So it felt like it came out of nowhere, and it doesn’t really match how you see yourself or your lifestyle.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;7;Client;Exactly. I mean, I’m busy, I’m active—well, as active as a 55-year-old can be. I don’t see how this fits.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;8;Therapist;It sounds like you’re feeling a bit conflicted—on one hand, you trust your GP, but on the other, this diagnosis doesn’t align with how you feel physically.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;9;Client;Yeah, that’s it. I don’t feel sick at all. I sleep well, I get around, I’m not struggling. It’s just... confusing.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;10;Therapist;That makes sense. Sometimes health issues like this can be silent, especially in the early stages. What do you know about Type 2 diabetes?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;11;Client;Not much, really. My GP mentioned it might be hereditary. My dad had it, and his brother too. But I haven’t looked into it much.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;12;Therapist;It’s great that you’re aware of the family connection. Diabetes can have a genetic component, but it’s not the only factor. Lifestyle plays a role too. Would you like me to share a bit more about how it works?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;13;Client;Sure, that might help. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;14;Therapist;Of course. So, Type 2 diabetes is often linked to how your body processes sugar. Insulin, a hormone, helps your cells use sugar for energy. In Type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to insulin, so sugar builds up in your blood.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;15;Client;Oh, so it’s like my body’s not using the sugar properly?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;16;Therapist;Exactly. And over time, high blood sugar can lead to other health issues. But the good news is, it can often be managed with small changes to diet, exercise, and sometimes medication.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;17;Client;Hmm. I guess that’s where I’m stuck. I don’t want to overhaul my life. I’m happy with how things are.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;18;Therapist;That’s completely valid. Big changes can feel overwhelming. What if we focused on small, manageable steps? For example, are there any areas of your lifestyle you’d be open to tweaking?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;19;Client;Well, I do drink a lot of coffee with sugar. Maybe I could start by cutting that out.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;20;Therapist;That’s a great starting point! Small changes like that can add up over time. How do you feel about that idea?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;21;Client;I think I could handle it. It’s not a huge sacrifice, and it might help.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;22;Therapist;That’s a really positive mindset. And you know, sometimes making one small change can inspire others. Have you thought about adding a bit more physical activity, like something social or fun?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;23;Client;I used to play squash years ago. Maybe I could get back into that. It’s social, and I’d enjoy it.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;24;Therapist;That sounds like a fantastic idea! Combining exercise with something you enjoy can make it feel less like a chore.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;25;Client;Yeah, and it might be a good way to get out of this rut I’ve been in.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;26;Therapist;It sounds like you’re ready to make some changes. How do you see this playing out over the next few months?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;27;Client;I’ll start with the coffee and maybe join the squash club. Then, in a few months, I’ll go back to my GP and see if there’s any improvement.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;28;Therapist;That’s a solid plan. It’s all about taking it one step at a time. How about we schedule a follow-up in a month to see how you’re doing?;;;
121;high;diabetes management;29;Client;Sure, that works for me. I’m actually feeling a bit more motivated now.;;;
121;high;diabetes management;30;Therapist;That’s great to hear! It’s been really helpful talking with you today. Remember, small steps can lead to big changes. I’ll see you in a month!;;;
121;high;diabetes management;31;Client;Thanks, Mark. I appreciate your help.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;0;client;Well, I'm here because my mom wants me to be here.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;1;therapist;I hear that. It sounds like this isn’t necessarily something you chose for yourself. How are you feeling about being here?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;2;client;I don’t really wanna be here, but… I guess I don’t have much of a choice.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;3;therapist;It’s tough when it feels like the decision is out of your hands. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on that led to this?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;4;client;Um, she found my stash… and she freaked out. She’s been going crazy over it. I don’t even know why she was going through my stuff in the first place.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;5;therapist;That sounds really frustrating. It’s like your privacy was crossed, and now it’s led to this situation. How did that make you feel when she found it?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;6;client;I was mad. I mean, it’s my stuff. I don’t go through her things, so why does she get to go through mine?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;7;therapist;That makes sense. It’s your personal space, and it feels unfair when someone crosses that boundary. What do you think her reaction says about how she’s feeling?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;8;client;I don’t know… I guess she’s worried or something. But she doesn’t have to freak out like that.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;9;therapist;It sounds like you can see that she might be coming from a place of concern, even if her reaction felt overwhelming to you. How do you feel about the stash itself?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;10;client;I mean, it’s not a big deal. It’s just something I do with my friends. They’re a cool group, and we hang out and… it’s just part of it.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;11;therapist;It sounds like this group means a lot to you, and they’ve become an important part of your life. What do you enjoy most about spending time with them?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;12;client;They’re just… fun. They get me, you know? We don’t judge each other. It’s like I can be myself around them.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;13;therapist;That’s really valuable—having people who accept you for who you are. It sounds like they provide a sense of belonging. At the same time, your mom’s reaction suggests she might see things differently. How do you feel about balancing those two parts of your life?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;14;client;I don’t know. I guess I don’t want her to worry, but I also don’t want her controlling everything I do.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;15;therapist;That’s a really important insight. You want your independence, but you also care about how your actions affect her. What do you think might help bridge that gap between you two?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;16;client;Maybe if she just talked to me instead of going through my stuff. I’m not a little kid anymore.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;17;therapist;That sounds like a really reasonable approach—having an open conversation where both of you can share your perspectives. How do you think she’d respond if you brought that up?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;18;client;I don’t know… maybe she’d listen. She might still freak out, but at least I’d feel like I tried.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;19;therapist;That’s a great attitude. Taking that step, even if it’s hard, shows a lot of maturity. What’s one small thing you could do to start that conversation with her?;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;20;client;I guess I could just tell her how I feel about her going through my stuff and ask her to talk to me instead.;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;21;therapist;That sounds like a solid plan. It’s not easy to have those conversations, but it could really help both of you understand each other better. How can I support you as you think about taking that step?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Hi there! I just finished your exam, and I’ve got some good news and something we might want to chat about. The good news is, no cavities—your teeth are looking great!;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;1;Client;Oh, that’s awesome! I’ve been trying to take better care of them.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;That’s great to hear! But I did notice something I’m a bit concerned about. When I looked at the roof of your mouth, I saw some irritation that’s often linked to tobacco use. You mentioned on your form that you don’t use tobacco, so I’m curious—what do you think might be causing that?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;3;Client;Hmm, that’s weird. I don’t smoke cigarettes or anything like that.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;Got it. The irritation I’m seeing is called nicotinic stomatitis, and it’s usually tied to tobacco use. It’s not something we see in people who don’t use tobacco. Could there be anything else you’re using, like cigars, pipes, or even vaping?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;5;Client;Well, I don’t smoke cigarettes, but sometimes when I’m out with friends, we’ll have these little flavored cigars—Swisher Sweets, you know? They come in peach and grape. It’s just something we do socially.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;Ah, I see. Those flavored mini cigars are pretty popular. A lot of people think they’re harmless because they’re fruity and small, but they still contain tobacco. Did you know they can cause the same health risks as regular cigarettes?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;7;Client;Really? I thought they were just a fun little thing to do with friends. They’re so small—I didn’t think they could be that bad.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;I totally get why you’d think that—they’re marketed that way. But even small amounts of tobacco can cause serious damage over time. What I’m seeing in your mouth is a sign of that. Have you ever thought about how these might be affecting your health?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;9;Client;I mean, I only do it occasionally when I’m out with friends. It’s not like I’m smoking a pack a day or anything.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;That’s a good point—it’s not a daily habit, which is great. But even occasional use can still cause harm. The irritation in your mouth is a sign of that. How do you feel about what I’ve shared so far?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;11;Client;I guess I didn’t realize it was that serious. I just thought of it as something fun to do socially, like having a drink.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;That makes sense. It’s easy to think of it that way, especially when it’s part of socializing. But the damage it’s causing is real. If you were to cut back or stop, do you think that would be something you’d want to do?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;13;Client;I don’t know. It’s not something I do often, so I’m not sure it’s a big deal.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;I hear you—it’s not a daily habit, so it might not feel like a priority. But even small changes can make a big difference for your health. What would it take for you to feel ready to make a change?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;15;Client;I guess I’d need to really believe it’s worth it. I don’t want to damage my health, but it’s also something I enjoy in the moment.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;That’s a really honest reflection. It’s tough to balance enjoying something in the moment with thinking about long-term health. What do you think might help you feel more confident about making a change?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;17;Client;Maybe if I learned more about the risks or found something else to do when I’m out with friends.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;Those are great ideas. Learning more about the risks might help you feel more motivated, and finding alternatives could make it easier to cut back. Would you be open to exploring some of those options together?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;19;Client;Yeah, I think so. I don’t want to hurt my health, but I also don’t want to feel like I’m missing out.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;That’s completely understandable. It’s about finding a balance that works for you. Let’s take it step by step and see what feels manageable. How does that sound?;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;21;Client;That sounds good. I’m willing to give it a try.;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;That’s great to hear! I’m here to support you every step of the way. Let’s start small and see how it goes. You’re already taking a big step by being open to this conversation.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;0;client;The baby was up all night, and I'm exhausted.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;1;therapist;It sounds like last night was really tough for you. Can you tell me more about what happened?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;2;client;Yes. She was up every three hours to eat. I don’t understand why she’s still doing this.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;3;therapist;That must have been really draining for you. How are you feeling about it right now?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;4;client;Frustrated, I guess. My mom told me I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old. Lilly is six weeks now, so I thought she’d be doing the same.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;5;therapist;It sounds like you had certain expectations based on what your mom shared, and it’s been hard because Lilly’s sleep pattern is different. What do you think might be contributing to her waking up so often?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;6;client;I’m not sure. Maybe she’s just hungrier? Or maybe I’m doing something wrong?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;7;therapist;It’s completely normal to feel unsure, especially as a new parent. Every baby is unique, and their needs can vary. What have you tried so far to help her sleep longer stretches?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;8;client;I’ve tried feeding her more during the day, but it doesn’t seem to make a difference.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;9;therapist;That’s a great step to try. It shows how much you care about figuring this out. Sometimes, it can take time to find what works best for both of you. How do you feel about exploring some other strategies together?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;10;client;I’d like that. I just want to make sure I’m doing the right thing for her.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;11;therapist;That’s a really caring perspective. Let’s start by looking at what’s been working and what hasn’t. What do you think has been the most challenging part of this for you?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;12;client;The lack of sleep, definitely. I feel like I can’t function during the day.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;13;therapist;That’s completely understandable. Sleep deprivation can take a toll on anyone. How have you been managing to take care of yourself during this time?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;14;client;Honestly, not very well. I feel like I’m just surviving right now.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;15;therapist;It’s okay to feel that way, and it’s important to acknowledge how hard this is. What would it look like for you to get a little more support or rest?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;16;client;I don’t know. Maybe asking my partner to help more during the night?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;17;therapist;That sounds like a great idea. How do you think your partner would feel about that?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;18;client;I think they’d be willing to help. They’ve offered before, but I feel like I should be able to handle it.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;19;therapist;It’s okay to lean on others, especially when you’re feeling overwhelmed. What’s one small step you could take today to start sharing some of the responsibilities?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;20;client;I could ask them to take one of the night feedings so I can get a longer stretch of sleep.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;21;therapist;That sounds like a really practical and caring plan. How do you feel about trying that tonight?;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;22;client;I think it’s worth a try. I just hope it helps.;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;23;therapist;It’s a step in the right direction, and it’s okay if it takes some time to see what works best. You’re doing a great job, and I’m here to support you through this.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hi, Kaylie! I’m Lori, the pharmacist here. I see you’re picking up a new prescription today. How are you doing?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;I’m good, thanks. Just grabbing a few things while I’m here.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Great! I noticed Dr. Ferris called in a prescription for cholesterol statin. Have you had a chance to talk with him about it?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Not really. He just mentioned I needed to start taking it after my blood test.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Got it. Well, I’d love to take a few minutes to go over it with you. Does that work for you?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Sure, that’s fine.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;Perfect! So, this medication is called cholesterol statin, and it’s designed to help lower your cholesterol levels. Do you know why managing cholesterol is important?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Not really. I mean, I know high cholesterol isn’t great, but I’m not sure why.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;That’s a great question! High cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease, heart attacks, or strokes. This medication helps lower that risk. How does that sound to you?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Oh, okay. That makes sense. I didn’t realize it was that serious.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;It’s definitely important to stay on top of it. Now, let’s talk about how to take it. Did Dr. Ferris mention how often you should take it?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;No, he didn’t say.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;No problem! You’ll take one tablet once a day. It’s best to take it at night, but you can take it anytime that works for you. Do you already have a routine for taking medications?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;Yeah, I take my other meds right before bed.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;That’s perfect! Taking it at night works really well with this medication. Do you think you’ll remember to take it daily?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;Yeah, I think so. I’m pretty consistent with my other meds.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;16;therapist;That’s great to hear! Consistency is key. Now, let’s talk about side effects. Most people tolerate this medication well, but some might experience mild muscle aches. If you notice anything severe, like intense pain or weakness, let Dr. Ferris know right away. Does that sound okay?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;17;client;Yeah, I’ll keep an eye out for that.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;18;therapist;Awesome. Also, this medication can interact with grapefruit juice, so it’s best to avoid that while you’re on it. Do you drink grapefruit juice often?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;19;client;Not really, but I’ll make sure to avoid it.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;20;therapist;Perfect. And if you ever start any new medications or supplements, just check with Dr. Ferris or me to make sure there aren’t any interactions.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;21;client;Okay, I’ll do that.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;22;therapist;Great! Just to make sure we’re on the same page, can you tell me how you’ll take this medication?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;23;client;Sure. I’ll take one tablet every night before bed, avoid grapefruit juice, and call the doctor if I have any bad muscle pain.;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;24;therapist;Exactly! You’ve got it. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the medication?;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;25;client;No, I think you covered everything. Thanks!;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;26;therapist;You’re welcome! I’ve set this prescription on autofill, so it’ll be ready for you every month. If anything comes up, our number is right here on the bottle. Have a great day, Kaylie!;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;27;client;Thanks, you too!;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Good morning! It’s great to see you here today. How are you feeling about taking this step to talk about quitting smoking?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;1;client;Good morning. I’m a bit nervous, but I think it’s time.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;That’s completely understandable. It’s a big step, and it’s great that you’re here. What’s been on your mind about quitting?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I think I need some help—maybe medication or something to make it easier.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Absolutely, we can definitely explore that. What else are you hoping to get out of our sessions?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;5;client;I just want to stop smoking for good. It’s getting harder to keep going like this.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;It sounds like you’re ready for a change. Can you tell me more about what’s made you decide to quit now?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;7;client;It’s just… I’m smoking way too much—20, 30 a day. And my friends have all quit. I feel like the odd one out.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;That must feel isolating, especially when you’re the only one stepping out for a smoke. How does that make you feel?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;9;client;It’s embarrassing, honestly. The other night at dinner, I was the only one who had to leave the table.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;That sounds like it was uncomfortable for you. So, feeling out of place and the embarrassment are big reasons for you. What else is motivating you to quit?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;11;client;It’s so expensive now. I spend about £7 a day—that’s £50 a week!;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Wow, that adds up quickly. £50 a week is a lot of money. How do you feel about spending that much on cigarettes?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;13;client;It’s crazy when I think about it. I could be using that money for something better.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Absolutely. So, we’ve got a few strong reasons here: the social pressure, the cost, and the smell. Do you feel like those are enough to keep you motivated?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;15;client;Yeah, I think so. I just need to figure out how to actually do it.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;That’s a great mindset. Have you thought about when you might want to start your quit journey?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;17;client;Not really. What do you recommend?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;18;therapist;It’s often helpful to pick a date when you’re not dealing with too much stress. Do you have a time coming up that might work for you?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;19;client;Maybe after this weekend. I’ve got a party, so maybe Monday morning?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Monday morning sounds like a solid plan. That gives you a fresh start to the week. Now, let’s talk about what smoking does for you. What do you enjoy most about it?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;21;client;It’s just… it helps me relax, especially at the end of the day.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;22;therapist;That makes sense. Smoking can feel like a way to unwind. What do you think you’ll miss the most when you quit?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;23;client;Probably that feeling of just… shutting off for a few minutes.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;24;therapist;That’s a really important insight. So, when you quit, we’ll need to find other ways to help you unwind. What do you think could replace that cigarette at the end of the day?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;25;client;Maybe just taking a walk or something. I don’t know.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;26;therapist;That’s a great idea. Fresh air and movement can be really helpful. Have you tried quitting before?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;27;client;Yeah, a couple of times. The longest I made it was about two weeks.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;28;therapist;That’s a good effort. What do you think brought you back to smoking?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;29;client;Stress, mostly. I had a big argument with my partner, and I just… caved.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Stress can be a huge trigger. It’s good to be aware of that so we can plan for it. Let’s talk about tools to help you this time. Have you heard of nicotine replacement therapy, like patches or gum?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;31;client;Yeah, I’ve seen the patches. I think I’d like to try those.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Great choice. Patches can be really effective, especially when paired with something like gum or lozenges for those tough moments. How do you usually feel when you can’t have a cigarette?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;33;client;I get really irritable, like I can’t focus on anything else.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;34;therapist;That’s a common experience, and it’s something we can manage. The patch will help with the overall cravings, and we can add something like gum for those moments when the irritability hits. Does that sound like a plan?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;35;client;Yeah, that makes sense.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Perfect. So, we’ve got your quit date set for Monday, and we’ll start with the patch and gum combo. How would you feel about checking in with me next week to see how it’s going?;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;37;client;That would be good. I think I’ll need the support.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Of course. I’ll give you a call mid-week to see how you’re doing. You’re taking a big step, and I’m here to help you through it.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;39;client;Thanks. I really appreciate it.;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;40;therapist;You’re welcome. Remember, this is your journey, and we’re in it together. See you soon!;;;
132;high;diabetes management;0;therapist;Hello again, Mr. Green. It’s great to see you. How have you been since our last session?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;1;client;Honestly, I’ve been a bit stressed. The doctor’s report has been on my mind—diabetes, cholesterol…;;;
132;high;diabetes management;2;therapist;It sounds like it’s been weighing on you. How are you feeling about everything right now?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;3;client;I don’t know. I feel like I’m being told to change everything, and it’s overwhelming.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;4;therapist;That’s completely understandable. Change can feel daunting, especially when it involves so much.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;5;client;Yeah, and the doctor said I’d need to take pills for the rest of my life. That doesn’t sit well.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;6;therapist;It sounds like that news was hard to hear. How do you feel about starting medication?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;7;client;I mean, if it’s going to save my life, I’ll do it. But I’d rather not rely on pills if I can help it.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;8;therapist;That makes sense. Medication is one part, but there are also things you can do to take control.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;9;client;Like what?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;10;therapist;Well, we’ve talked about smoking, diet, exercise, and weight loss. Where do you feel most ready to start?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;11;client;I guess… losing weight? But it’s so hard to give up the things I enjoy.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;12;therapist;It is hard. What makes losing weight important to you, though?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;13;client;I want to be around for my family—my kids, my grandkids. I don’t want to be a burden to them.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;14;therapist;That’s a really powerful motivation. Being there for your family matters a lot to you.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;15;client;It does. I’ve been thinking about them a lot lately.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;16;therapist;That’s a great starting point. What’s one small step you could take toward that goal?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;17;client;Maybe cutting down on drinking. I know it’s not helping my weight or blood pressure.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;18;therapist;That’s a really good idea. How do you feel about taking that step?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;19;client;I think I can do it. My wife says I drink too much on weekends anyway.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;20;therapist;It sounds like you’ve got some support there, which is great. What else could help you stay on track?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;21;client;I could cut out the crisps and pies at work. They’re not doing me any favors.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;22;therapist;That’s a good plan. What would you replace them with to keep you full and energized?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;23;client;Maybe soup? A big bowl of vegetable soup would be healthier than two pies.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;24;therapist;That’s a fantastic choice. Soup can be filling and nutritious. Anything else you’ve already started?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;25;client;I’ve stopped adding salt to my food. The doctor said it would help with my blood pressure.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;26;therapist;That’s a great step! Reducing salt can also protect your bones by preventing calcium loss.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;27;client;Really? I didn’t know that. I’ll tell my wife—her mom had osteoporosis.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;28;therapist;That’s a great idea. You could support each other. You’re already making some really positive changes.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;29;client;I feel like I’m on the right track. Cutting out the booze, crisps, and pies—it’s a start.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;30;therapist;Absolutely. Taking it step by step is the best way to make lasting changes. How do you feel now?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;31;client;Better. I feel like I’ve got a plan, and I’m ready to give it a go.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;32;therapist;That’s wonderful to hear. Shall we meet again next week to check in on your progress?;;;
132;high;diabetes management;33;client;Yes, that works for me.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;34;therapist;Great. I’ll see you then. Take care, Mr. Green.;;;
132;high;diabetes management;35;client;Thanks. You too.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;Thanks for coming in today, Daryl. I appreciate you taking the time to sit down with me. How are you feeling about being here?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;Honestly, I’m not sure. I’ve been in this kind of situation before, and it’s hard to know if it’ll make a difference.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;That’s completely understandable. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s not easy to trust that things can change. What’s been on your mind lately about where you’re at in life?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;I’ve been thinking about how easy it would be to go back to dealing. I mean, I know how to do it, and it’s quick money. But I also know it’s not the life I want anymore.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;It sounds like you’re at a crossroads—on one hand, there’s the familiarity of that life, and on the other, there’s this sense that it might not lead where you want to go. What’s holding you back from going back to it?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;Fiona. She’s made it clear that if I go back to that life, she’s done. And I can’t lose her. She’s been through everything with me.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;Fiona sounds really important to you. Can you tell me more about her and what she means to you?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;We’ve been together for 12 years. She’s the one person who’s stuck by me through all the chaos. She believes in me, even when I don’t believe in myself.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;That’s a powerful connection. It sounds like she sees something in you that you might not always see in yourself. What do you think she sees?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;She sees the guy I used to be—the one who was fun, romantic, and had dreams. Not the guy who keeps messing up.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;So, there’s a version of you that Fiona believes in, and it sounds like part of you wants to reconnect with that person too. What do you think it would take to start moving in that direction?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;I don’t know. That’s the problem. I don’t even know where to start. It feels like I’m stuck in this loop, and I can’t see a way out.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;It’s okay to feel stuck. Change is hard, especially when the path forward isn’t clear. But you’ve already taken a big step by being here today and talking about it. What’s one small thing you could do to start exploring what’s possible?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;I guess I could talk to my mate who got out of the life. He’s a drug counselor now. I don’t know how he did it, but maybe he could give me some ideas.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;That sounds like a great idea. He’s someone who’s walked a similar path and found a way out. What do you think it would be like to reach out to him?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;It’d be weird, honestly. We haven’t talked in years. But I think he’d be willing to help. He’s that kind of guy.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;It’s brave of you to consider reaching out. It’s not easy to ask for help, but it sounds like you’re willing to take that step. What do you think Fiona would say if you told her you were thinking about talking to him?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;She’d probably be relieved. She’s been trying to get me to do something—anything—to move forward. I just haven’t known what to do.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;It sounds like Fiona’s been a big support for you, and she’s rooting for you to find a way forward. What would it feel like to have her by your side as you take these steps?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;It’d make it easier, I think. She’s always been my rock. But I don’t want to let her down again.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;It’s clear how much she means to you, and it sounds like you’re motivated to make this work for both of you. What’s one thing you could do this week to show her you’re serious about making a change?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;I could call my mate and set up a time to talk. It’s not much, but it’s a start.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;That’s a great first step. It’s not about doing everything at once—it’s about taking small, meaningful steps. How would it feel to take that step and see where it leads?;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;It’d feel… different. But maybe in a good way. I don’t know. I’m tired of being stuck.;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;24;therapist;That’s a powerful realization. It sounds like you’re ready to try something new, even if it’s uncertain. Let’s check in next time and see how it goes. You’re not alone in this, Daryl. We’ll figure it out together.;;;
