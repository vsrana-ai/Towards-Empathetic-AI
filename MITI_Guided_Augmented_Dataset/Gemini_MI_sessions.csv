3;high;diet and weight loss management;0;client;Well see, my wife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits, and I really don't see what the big problem is. I mean, I've been working real hard. Sometimes I can't come home for dinner, so I'm having to go out to eat at Applebee's or something like that, so-- but she seems to have a bigger problem, I really don't see what the big deal is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;1;therapist;It sounds like you're feeling a bit confused and maybe even a little frustrated that your wife is concerned about your eating habits, while you feel like everything is fine.  Is that a fair summary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;2;client;Yeah, I mean, I feel fine.  Work's tough, I work hard all day, and grabbing something quick at Applebee's is just…easier.  She doesn't get it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;3;therapist;So, the convenience of grabbing a quick bite after a long day is really important to you right now.  Tell me more about what a typical workday looks like for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;4;client;Well, it's manual labor, mostly outside. Hot sun, you know. I'm on my feet all day.  I sweat a lot, so I figure I'm burning off whatever I eat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;5;therapist;That sounds physically demanding.  It makes sense that you’d want something quick and easy after a long day like that.  So, you mentioned sweating a lot – how do you think that impacts your overall health and well-being?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;6;client;Well, I mean, I feel okay.  A little tired sometimes, but nothing major.  I figure sweating's good, right? Gets rid of the bad stuff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;7;therapist;It sounds like you’re pretty in tune with your body. You mentioned feeling tired sometimes – is that a regular thing, or just occasionally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;8;client;Eh, sometimes.  Especially towards the end of the week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;9;therapist;Okay.  And you mentioned you had a physical last year.  Everything was good then, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;10;client;Yeah, the doctor said I was fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;11;therapist;That’s good to hear.  So, if you’re feeling okay, and your doctor gave you a clean bill of health last year, what do you think might be driving your wife’s concern?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;12;client;I don't know. She says I need to eat healthier, maybe cook more at home.  But honestly, I don't have the time or energy for that after work.  And like I said, I feel fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;13;therapist;It sounds like you value the convenience of eating out after a long day, and that cooking at home feels like a significant challenge given your work schedule.  It also sounds like you trust your own assessment of your health.  Is that right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;14;client;Yeah, pretty much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;15;therapist;Okay. So, just to make sure I understand, you’re not particularly concerned about your health right now, you feel your current eating habits work for you given your work schedule, and you’re a little puzzled by your wife’s concerns. Is there anything else I should know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;16;client;No, I think that covers it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;17;therapist;Okay. Thanks for sharing all of that with me.  It sounds like you've given this some thought.  What are your thoughts on exploring this a little further, maybe looking at the connection between diet, energy levels, and long-term health?  No pressure at all, just an option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;18;client;I guess… I mean, if it’s quick. I don’t have a lot of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3;high;diet and weight loss management;19;therapist;Absolutely. We can keep it brief and focus on what’s relevant to you. How about we start by talking a little bit more about what 'healthy eating' means to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Emily. It's good to see you again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;1;client;Hi. Yeah, it's been a little while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;2;therapist;I notice something new!  You've got a lip piercing.  Looks interesting. How long have you had it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;3;client;Oh, thanks! About a month now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;4;therapist;Cool. So, what prompted you to get it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;5;client;Um, I don't know, really. Just felt like a change, I guess.  A bit bored with the usual, and it's kind of fun to stand out a little.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;6;therapist;I get that.  A little something different can be refreshing.  So, what's been your experience with it so far?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;7;client;Pretty good!  It's still new, so mostly just getting used to it.  I like how it looks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;8;therapist;It does look good.  As your dentist, though, I do have a few things I usually discuss with patients who have oral piercings. Have you thought much about how it might affect your teeth or gums?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;9;client;Not really, to be honest. I mean, I figured it might, you know, rub against them a bit, but I haven't really looked into it. My teeth are pretty good, so I haven't been too worried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;10;therapist;You do have great teeth, and I always enjoy seeing how well you take care of them.  That's why I want to make sure we're on the same page about this.  Sometimes, these piercings can cause some gum recession, particularly right where the jewelry sits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;11;client;Oh, really? I didn't know that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;12;therapist;It's something to be aware of.  And we also see chipped teeth occasionally, from the jewelry bumping against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;13;client;Oh wow. I definitely don't want to mess up my teeth.  You've mentioned my gums being a little lower before, and how important flossing is. I know I'm not the best at that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;14;therapist;Flossing is definitely key, and we can always talk more about that too.  It sounds like you're already thinking about the potential impact on your oral health.  What would make you consider taking the piercing out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;15;client;I guess if I started seeing actual problems, like the gum thing you mentioned, or if I chipped a tooth. But right now, it's fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;16;therapist;"So, you're thinking a ""wait and see"" approach, keeping an eye on things?";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;17;client;Yeah, pretty much.  It's only been a month, and like I said, I like it.  But my teeth are important, so…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;18;therapist;Absolutely.  It sounds like you're weighing the aesthetic appeal against the potential risks, which is a smart approach. So, monitoring it closely and being aware of any changes is your plan for now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4;high;managing life;19;client;Exactly.  I mean, the piercing might not be forever, but I'd like my teeth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;0;therapist;Hi, Sal. Thanks for coming in today. I know it’s not always easy to make time for these appointments, so I really appreciate you being here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;1;client;No problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;2;therapist;So, Sal, what brings you in to see me today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;3;client;Well, my doctor suggested I come talk to someone.  She mentioned something about needing to make some changes…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;4;therapist;Okay. And what’s your understanding of those suggested changes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;5;client;Honestly, it feels like I’m being asked to change everything all at once.  It’s a bit overwhelming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;6;therapist;It sounds like you’re feeling quite a bit of pressure to make these changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;7;client;Definitely.  There’s the asthma, which has been acting up lately, and then there’s… well, everything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;8;therapist;Can you tell me a little more about this “everything else”?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;9;client;It’s the dog, for one.  The doctor thinks Oscar is making my asthma worse, which is ridiculous.  He’s my best friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;10;therapist;It sounds like the possibility of having to give up Oscar is really upsetting you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;11;client;It is.  He’s been with me through thick and thin.  And then there’s the drinking…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;12;therapist;So, cutting back on your drinking is also something you’re thinking about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;13;client;Yeah, it’s on the list.  Along with cutting back on cigarettes, which I’ve already made some progress on, actually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;14;therapist;That’s great to hear!  So, you’ve already started making some positive changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;15;client;Yeah, but it feels like there’s still so much more.  And with my wife on maternity leave, and me being the only one working… it’s just a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;16;therapist;It sounds like you’re carrying a lot right now, Sal.  Between your health, your family, and the pressure to make these changes, it’s understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;17;client;Exactly.  It just feels like too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;18;therapist;So, Sal, we have about [duration] together today.  Where would you like to start?  What feels like the most pressing issue for you right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6;high;asthma management;19;client;I think the Oscar situation is really weighing on me.  And my asthma has been pretty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;So, you mentioned you sprained your ankle yesterday. Tell me a bit about how that happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Ugh, it's so embarrassing. I was at a 90s-themed pub crawl, and, well, you know how those are. A few drinks, and then I thought it would be brilliant to jump off the bus stairs to catch up with my friends. I was wearing stilettos, of all things. And, yeah, I landed wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;A 90s pub crawl in stilettos – sounds like quite an adventure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Definitely an adventure. Though my ankle didn't think so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;So, the dancing ended abruptly, I imagine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Yeah, the dancing was over. And so was my night, pretty much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;I understand. I'm curious, would you be open to talking a little about your alcohol use in general, beyond last night?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Uh, sure. As long as we don't dwell on the vodka shots. I'm still… yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;Still feeling the after-effects?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;That sounds rough. So, what does a typical week look like for you in terms of alcohol consumption?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Well, my friends and I, we usually go out on weekends. We're all university students, so it's kind of the norm to have a few drinks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;A few drinks being a regular part of the university experience, as you see it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Yeah, pretty much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;And what does 'a few' mean? Is that per night, or are we talking two or three drinks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;If we're going out, it can be more than a few. Like, if I'm really going for it, maybe seven or eight. And then, you know, a beer or two after a long day at the library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;Seven or eight drinks – that's quite a bit. Do you ever have any concerns about your drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Not really. It seems pretty normal for university.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;So, no real concerns at this point, and you feel it's in line with what other students are doing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Yeah, exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Would you be willing to take a look at the low-risk drinking guidelines?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Sure, why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;I know you might not be feeling your best right now, but let's just briefly glance at these. They suggest that for women, the safe limit is around 10 drinks a week, with no more than two drinks on any single day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Oh, wow. Really?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Yeah. Where do you think you fall in relation to those guidelines?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Uh… probably a bit over, especially with midterms coming up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;So, it's maybe a way to manage stress a bit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Yeah, I guess so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;And has that been your way of coping for a while now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Yeah, it has, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;Okay. Does that concern you at all, even a little?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;Um, the 10 drinks just seems like such a small amount, especially with my tolerance. I've built that up over time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;I understand. So, the guideline amount seems low given your experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;Do you see any potential benefits to staying within those guidelines, or reducing your alcohol intake?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;Uh, benefits… Well, health-wise, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;Tell me more about what you mean by that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Well, I mean, I definitely don't feel great right now. And I know I'm more productive when I'm not hungover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;So, you recognize some advantages to drinking less?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;Yeah, definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;That's a great insight. Would you be open to exploring this further with me sometime when you're feeling a bit better? Maybe we could talk more about those potential benefits?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;Yeah, I think so. Maybe when I haven't just… you know… done this to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;I'd be happy to schedule another appointment with you. Would later this week or early next week work for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;Okay, yeah. That sounds good. Just not on another Saturday morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;Absolutely. We can find a better time. Thanks for talking with me today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;Yeah, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hi Bob, thanks for coming in. What's on your mind today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Well, honestly, my wife's the reason I'm here. She thinks I have a smoking problem. I've smoked for years, and now, since she quit six months ago, it's like I'm the villain. She's really been on my case about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;It sounds like you're feeling pressured to be here, and maybe a little frustrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;3;client;That's putting it mildly. I mean, I'm missing work for this. It feels like a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;So, it's not just the smoking itself, but the feeling of being forced into this that's bothering you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Exactly. It's the constant nagging. Six months of it! She quit, so now I have to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Help me understand. What are some of the specific things your wife is concerned about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;7;client;The usual – my health. She's always showing me these articles about secondhand smoke. It's like a daily dose of guilt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;So, she's worried about the impact on your health, and maybe even the impact your smoking has on others around you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Yeah, and it's changed our routines too. We used to enjoy a cigarette together, now I'm banished outside, even in the worst weather. It feels like she's completely changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;It sounds like you feel like your shared habits and rituals have been disrupted, and that's creating some tension.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Absolutely. And the kids are in on it too. It feels like I'm the target of a family campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;So, you've got your wife, your kids, and the constant reminders about health risks. It sounds like you're feeling ganged up on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Yeah, exactly. It's like I'm the only one who smokes anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Bob, you mentioned your dad still smokes at 85. What comes to mind when you think about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Well, he's fine. I mean, it makes me wonder if all this fuss is really necessary. But I also know things are different now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;It sounds like you're weighing the immediate pressure from your family against your own experience and observations. You’re also acknowledging that times and understanding of health risks have changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Yeah. I mean, I love my wife and kids. I don't want to lose them over this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;It sounds like your relationship with your family is a top priority for you. You’ve been married for 25 years, and this is the first major conflict you've faced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Yeah, it is. We’ve always been good together. This is really putting a strain on things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;So, on the one hand, you value your relationship and don't want to lose it. On the other hand, you're feeling pressured and maybe a little resentful about the way this is being handled. Is that a fair summary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Yeah, that's pretty much it. I don't want to lose my family, but I also don't like being told what to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;"It sounds like you're in a tough spot, Bob. It's not just about the cigarettes; it's about navigating these important relationships and finding a way forward that works for everyone. It's not an easy situation.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;23;client;No, it's not. I don't know what to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;It seems like you're thinking about the future, and how this issue might impact your relationship long-term. You mentioned the possibility of gradual change. What are your thoughts on that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;25;client;I’d be more open to that. Just quitting cold turkey feels impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;It sounds like a more gradual approach might feel less overwhelming and more manageable for you. There are definitely strategies and resources we can explore to support that. We could also talk about involving your wife in this process. Would that be something you'd be open to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Definitely. She needs to hear this. She thinks I can just snap my fingers and quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;I’d be happy to have her join us. Perhaps we could find a time that works for both of you to come in and discuss this together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;29;client;Okay. I'll talk to her and give you a call tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Great, Bob. I look forward to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
8;high;smoking cessation;31;client;Thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;0;Therapist;Hi there. Thanks for coming in today.  I understand you're here to talk about managing your diabetes. Is that right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;1;Client;Yeah, that's right. I was just diagnosed, and honestly, I'm a bit overwhelmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;2;Therapist;I can imagine.  Being diagnosed with diabetes can feel like a lot to take in.  It sounds like you've already had a conversation with your doctor about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;3;Client;Yeah, I did. She went over my A1C results, which were pretty high, and talked about all the potential complications – eyesight, feet, all of it.  It was really scary. That's why I'm here, I guess. I need to figure out how to manage all of this, but it just seems so daunting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;4;Therapist;It sounds like you're feeling quite anxious about the potential health risks and the changes you might need to make.  It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when faced with something like this.  It's a big adjustment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;5;Client;Exactly!  She talked about medication, diet changes, exercise...it's a huge list.  I'm not even sure I can do all of that.  And the thought of all those complications if I *don't*...it's just a lot to handle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;6;Therapist;So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of changes that seem necessary, and also quite worried about the potential consequences if you're not able to make those changes. Is that a fair summary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;7;Client;Yeah, that's pretty much it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;8;Therapist;Okay.  So, let's break things down a little.  Instead of looking at the entire list of changes all at once, maybe we could start by exploring what *you* feel might be the easiest or most manageable first step.  What comes to mind when you think about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;9;Client;Hmm... I guess the diet thing seems the most immediate. I know I need to change how I eat, but I don't even know where to start. It feels like my whole life revolves around food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;10;Therapist;That's a very common feeling.  Many people find dietary changes challenging.  It's understandable that you feel that way. So, it sounds like you're identifying diet as something important, and you're also recognizing some of the challenges you anticipate.  Tell me a little more about what makes you say your whole life revolves around food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;11;Client;Well, I work long hours, and when I get home, I'm exhausted.  Cooking a healthy meal feels like a huge effort.  Takeout is just so much easier.  And then there's social stuff – going out to eat with friends, family gatherings... food is always a big part of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;12;Therapist;So, convenience and social connections both play a role in your current eating habits.  It sounds like there are several factors to consider.  It's not just about the food itself, but also the context in which you're eating.  Is that right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;13;Client;Yeah, that's a good way to put it.  It's not just the food, it's everything around it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;14;Therapist;Okay.  So, given that convenience and social connections are important factors, what are some small, realistic changes you could imagine making to your diet that might address those factors?  We're not talking about huge overhauls here, just small, manageable steps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;15;Client;Hmm... maybe I could start by packing my lunch for work instead of getting takeout every day.  That would at least take care of one meal.  And maybe I could look for healthier options when I do go out with friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;16;Therapist;Those sound like some great starting points. Packing your lunch could definitely increase convenience and give you more control over what you're eating.  And looking for healthier options when dining out is another smart strategy. So, it sounds like you've already got some ideas.  What feels most doable right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;17;Client;The lunch thing, I think.  I could probably manage that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;18;Therapist;Okay, great.  So, packing your lunch is something you feel confident you could try.  Let's talk a little more about that. What kind of support or resources might be helpful for you to make that happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;19;Client;Maybe some quick and easy recipes? I'm not a great cook.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;20;Therapist;Absolutely.  We can definitely find some resources for that.  So, it sounds like some quick recipes would be helpful.  Is there anything else that might make this easier for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;21;Client;Maybe some containers? I don't have very good ones right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;22;Therapist;Great idea.  Having the right containers can make a big difference.  So, we've identified some quick recipes and new containers as potential supports.  How do you feel about trying this out for the next week and then we can check in and see how it's going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;23;Client;Yeah, I think I can do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;24;Therapist;Excellent.  Remember, we're taking this one step at a time.  Small changes can lead to big results.  I'm here to support you in any way I can.  We'll talk more next week and see how things are progressing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;low;diabetes management;25;Client;Okay, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;0;Therapist;So, tell me more about what brings you in today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;1;Client;Well, they found a small amount of marijuana on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;2;Therapist;I see.  Can you tell me a little more about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;3;Client;It wasn't much, honestly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;4;Therapist;Okay.  So, it sounds like the quantity is a key part of this for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;5;Client;Yeah, I mean, it's not like I'm some big dealer or anything.  It was just for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;6;Therapist;Just for personal use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;7;Client;Yeah, exactly.  And honestly, it's California.  Everyone does it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;8;Therapist;It sounds like you're thinking about the context of where we are and how common this is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;9;Client;Yeah, pretty much. So, how long is this whole thing going to take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;10;Therapist;That's a very understandable question. We have about 15-20 minutes for our session today, and this is the first of several sessions we'll have together over the next six months.  It's natural to want to know the timeframe.  Beyond the time commitment, what else is on your mind about this whole process?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;11;Client;I just want to get this over with as quickly as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;12;Therapist;So, your focus is on completing whatever is necessary to put this behind you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;13;Client;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;14;Therapist;Okay. That makes sense. I have a form we can use to create a shared agenda for our sessions. This can help us stay focused on your goals and ensure I'm supporting you in the best way possible to get this resolved. Would you be open to working on that together now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;15;Client;Sure, that sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;16;Therapist;Great. Let's start by thinking about what a successful outcome would look like for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;17;Client;Well, obviously, getting through this without any major consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;18;Therapist;So, minimizing any negative impact is a top priority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;19;Client;Yeah, and also, I guess, figuring out how to avoid this kind of situation in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;20;Therapist;That's a really important point.  So, we're talking about both immediate consequences and longer-term strategies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;21;Client;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;high;reducing recidivism;22;Therapist;Okay, let's write those down on the form.  We can then break down those goals into smaller, more manageable steps we can work on together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Sarah, it's good to see you again.  How are you doing today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;I'm okay, I guess.  A little stressed, to be honest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;I understand.  Life can be hectic.  We talked last time about your smoking and drinking habits. How have things been going since then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;Um, not great. I haven't really made any changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;That's perfectly alright.  Change can be challenging.  What's been getting in the way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;Well, work has been crazy, and then my son has been sick.  It's just been easier to light up a cigarette or have a drink to unwind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;It sounds like you've had a lot on your plate.  So, smoking and having a drink in the evenings have been your way of coping with that stress?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;Yeah, pretty much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;I hear you.  It makes sense that you'd reach for something that helps you relax when things get overwhelming.  Tell me more about what those evenings are like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;Well, I put my son to bed, and then I finally have some time to myself.  That's when I usually smoke and have a couple of drinks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;So, it's that 'me time' that you look forward to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;And what else do you do during that 'me time' besides smoking and drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;Not much, really.  Sometimes I watch TV or scroll through my phone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;So, it sounds like those activities are also part of your relaxation routine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;Yeah, I guess so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;Okay.  Let's talk a bit more about your smoking.  You mentioned you haven't made any changes.  How many cigarettes are you smoking a day now, roughly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;Probably still around eight or nine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;And how about alcohol?  How many drinks are you having in a week?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;Probably closer to ten than seven, if I'm being honest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;Thanks for your honesty, Sarah.  I appreciate you sharing that with me.  It takes courage to be open about these things. So, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is 'not at all ready to consider making a change' and 10 is 'completely ready to make a change,' where would you say you are right now regarding your smoking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;Probably still around a five, like last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;Okay, a five.  That's interesting.  What makes you say a five and not a three or a two?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;23;Client;I know I should probably cut back, especially with my son.  And you mentioned the health risks last time, and those are in the back of my mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;So, those health concerns and your family are motivating factors for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;25;Client;Yeah, definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;That's understandable.  It sounds like you have some important reasons to consider making a change. What would it take to move that number closer to a seven or an eight?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;27;Client;I don't know.  It just feels so hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;I understand.  Change can be difficult, especially when it's something you enjoy and use to relax.  What are some things you could try that might make it a little easier?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;29;Client;Maybe I could try going for a walk instead of having a cigarette. Or maybe try drinking sparkling water instead of wine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;30;Therapist;Those sound like some great ideas, Sarah.  So, you're thinking about replacing the smoking and drinking with other activities?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;31;Client;Yeah, maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;32;Therapist;That's a fantastic starting point.  We can explore some other strategies as well.  How would you feel about trying those out for the next couple of weeks and then we can check in again and see how it's going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;33;Client;Yeah, I think I could do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;34;Therapist;Great.  And remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way.  We can work together to find what works best for you.  We can also talk more about managing stress in other ways, if you'd like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;35;Client;That would be helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;36;Therapist;Absolutely. We can schedule another appointment in a couple of weeks to discuss your progress and explore some stress management techniques. How does that sound?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;37;Client;Sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;38;Therapist;Wonderful.  I'm glad we had this conversation, Sarah. You're taking a positive step by even considering these changes.  I'll see you in a couple of weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;high;smoking cessation;39;Client;Okay, thanks.  See you then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Hi, Mrs. Smith.  It's good to see you and Lilly today. We're scheduled for some routine vaccinations today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Oh, hi.  Actually, I'm a little hesitant about the vaccines. I've been reading some things online, and I'm not sure they're the best thing for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;I understand. It's perfectly normal to have questions and concerns, especially when it comes to your child's health.  Tell me more about what you've been reading and what's making you unsure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Well, I've seen some articles saying it's better for kids to build their immunity naturally, you know, by getting the actual diseases.  Like, I had chickenpox as a kid, and now I'm immune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;That's a great example.  You're right, having chickenpox gives you natural immunity.  It sounds like you're thinking about the benefits of natural immunity versus the immunity provided by vaccines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;Exactly.  I just worry about overloading her little system with so many vaccines.  And I've heard some scary things about side effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;I appreciate you sharing your concerns. It's important to weigh all the information. Let's talk about the specific diseases these vaccines protect against and how they can impact children.  Before vaccines, diseases like measles, polio, and whooping cough were much more common and could have devastating consequences, sometimes leading to serious disabilities or even death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Wow, I didn't realize they were that serious. I've heard of polio, but I don't really know much about it.  And honestly, some of the other diseases you mentioned, I've never even heard of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;That's actually a testament to how successful vaccines have been.  They've become so effective at preventing these diseases that many people today haven't seen or experienced their impact firsthand.  Because of this success, sometimes we forget how dangerous these diseases used to be.  Would you be open to learning a bit more about the specific diseases we're vaccinating Lilly against today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;Yeah, I think that would be helpful. I want to make an informed decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;Absolutely.  Let's start with measles.  It's highly contagious and can cause a rash, fever, and in some cases, serious complications like pneumonia, brain damage, or even death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;That sounds scary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;It is. And before the measles vaccine, it was a very common childhood illness.  Polio, which you mentioned, is another example. It can cause paralysis and was a major public health crisis in the past.  These are just two examples, and each vaccine protects against a disease with its own set of risks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;So, the vaccines are meant to prevent those kinds of serious illnesses?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;Therapist;Exactly. They work by helping Lilly's immune system develop antibodies to fight these diseases without her having to actually get sick.  It's a way to build immunity safely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;Client;I see.  I guess I hadn't really thought about it that way. I was so focused on the potential risks of the vaccines themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;Therapist;That's understandable. It’s important to discuss those risks too.  Vaccines, like any medication, can have side effects.  Most are mild, like soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever.  Serious side effects are very rare.  We can talk more about those if;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Therapist;So, it sounds like your goal is to enjoy the things you like, but in a healthier way, by cutting back rather than giving them up entirely?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;Yeah, I think so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;Okay.  This feels really important to you, right?  You mentioned wanting to be healthier and more active, like your friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is 'not at all confident' and 10 is 'completely confident,' how confident are you *right now* about starting this new approach?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;Right now, probably a six.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;A six. Okay. What makes it a six and not lower, say a three or a four?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;Because I've been thinking about this for years. It's something I've wanted for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;That makes sense. So, what's holding you back from a higher number, like an eight or nine? What makes you think it might drop when you get home?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;Well, when I'm around the food, it's just harder.  The temptation is there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;I understand. So, it sounds like the environment plays a big role. Let's explore that a bit. What kind of support or changes in your environment might make it easier to stick to your goals?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe having healthier options readily available?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;That's a great idea.  So, if you had healthier, readily available options, that would boost your confidence?  How much would that move you up the scale, do you think?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;Probably to an eight, maybe even a nine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;That's significant! So, let's focus on that for a moment.  What are some specific, concrete steps you could take to make those healthier options more readily available?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Client;I could maybe meal prep more, or talk to my family about buying different foods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;16;Therapist;Excellent! Those are actionable steps.  Which one feels more doable right now, or which one would you like to explore first?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;17;Client;Meal prepping, I think.  That feels like something I can control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;18;Therapist;Great. So, let's talk about meal prepping. What kind of meals would be helpful to have prepped?  What would make it easier and more enjoyable?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;19;Client;Maybe some salads, and some pre-portioned meals for dinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;20;Therapist;Fantastic.  So, salads and pre-portioned meals. What ingredients would you need for those?  And when would you have time to do the prepping?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;21;Client;I could probably do it on Sunday afternoons.  And I'd need, like, lots of veggies, some lean protein...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;22;Therapist;Sounds like you're already thinking this through.  So, Sunday afternoon for prep, focusing on veggies, lean protein, and pre-portioned meals.  How confident are you that you could make that happen this week?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;23;Client;Pretty confident, maybe a seven or eight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;24;Therapist;That's wonderful! You've moved your confidence up just by talking through some concrete steps. What else could we explore that might further boost your confidence and help you achieve your goal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;25;Client;I guess I could also look for some healthy recipes online.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;26;Therapist;Excellent idea! That could add variety and make the meal prepping even more appealing. So, you've identified meal prepping, talking to your family about healthier food choices, and finding new recipes.  You've already taken some big steps just by exploring these ideas. What feels like the most important step to focus on first?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;27;Client;Definitely the meal prepping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;28;Therapist;Okay, meal prepping it is. Let's delve into the specifics of that a little more. What resources do you have available, and what might you need to get started?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;high;diet and weight loss management;29;Client;I have containers, and I can go grocery shopping...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi Rick, it's good to see you again.  We've talked before about your living situation with Tristan and how it relates to the goals you're working towards.  I'd like to explore that a bit more today.  Could you tell me about some of the advantages and disadvantages of staying where you are?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Well, the place is great.  It's close to work, and Tristan's a good mate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;That makes sense.  It sounds like there are some real positives.  Thinking about the changes you're hoping to make, how do you see your current living situation supporting those changes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;That's the tricky part, isn't it? I'm not sure if it's the ideal environment for me to make these changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;I hear you.  It sounds like you're weighing things up.  You mentioned Tristan being a good mate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Yeah, he is. But we're at different stages of life now.  He doesn't have the same responsibilities I do, and I can't expect him to change his lifestyle just because I want to change mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;That's a very insightful point. It sounds like you're recognizing the differences in your current situations.  Have you talked much with Tristan about the changes you're aiming for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;I've mentioned it, and he says he's supportive. But, like I said, he's in a different place. He doesn't have kids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;Right.  So, it sounds like while he's supportive, there might be a gap in understanding due to those different life experiences.  Let's switch gears a bit. You also mentioned considering moving in with your aunt and uncle. What are some of the potential pros and cons of that option?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;The food would be amazing! And I know my family would be really supportive.  But I'm also worried about losing my independence.  I'm worried they might take over, you know? I value the freedom I have now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;That's a valid concern.  It sounds like you're balancing the support your family offers with the desire to maintain your autonomy.  Thinking about that freedom you value, how does that connect with your goals of reconnecting with your children and partner?  How do you see those things working together?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I definitely don't want to hold onto my freedom if it means losing my kids.  I'd do anything to have them back in my life. I'm just worried that even with good intentions, moving in with family might... I don't know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;It sounds like you're anticipating some potential challenges, even with the support of family.  It's good that you're thinking this through carefully. What are some of the specific things you're worried about in that scenario?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Well, they might try to manage things too much, even with the best intentions. I need to learn to manage things myself, you know, for my kids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;That makes perfect sense. It sounds like you're recognizing the importance of taking ownership of your own life and changes, which is crucial for regaining custody of your children.  It seems like you are really thinking deeply about what will be best for you and your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Yeah, I am. It's a lot to think about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;Absolutely.  It's a big decision, and it's great that you're exploring all these different angles.  We can continue to unpack this next session, if that sounds good to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;You're welcome, Rick.  I'll see you next week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;See you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;0;Therapist;So you're sick of this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;1;Client;Yeah. I-I just-- I can't shoplift anymore. You know, I got- I got caught again. And uh, you know, I-I got suspended, I got back to school, so I'm-I'm uh-- I'm gonna mess up my whole life here, unless I can stop this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;2;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;3;Client;Yeah, it's bad. My friends and I, we just-- I mean, it's fun and uh-- so I don't know what to do, but I- but I gotta change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;4;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;5;Client;I want it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;6;Therapist;So, it sounds like you're ready. You're ready to give this up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;7;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;8;Therapist;But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;9;Client;Right. I don't know what I'm gonna do, I got some friends. These guys are-- they're bad news, but they're my friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;10;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;11;Client;And, uh, and it's fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;12;Therapist;And it's fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;13;Client;You know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;14;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;15;Client;Nothing-nothing much else going on that's as fun as this. We go in, we steal these CDs. It was working out fine, but—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;high;reducing recidivism;16;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;Um, I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;Well, um, It's just me and him and I do smoke. Um, I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I-I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. But it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and-and my having a full-time job. And so it's just-- that's why I started smoking again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;Yeah. Some people have a glass of wine. I have a cigarette.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;I know it's not good for him. I mean, I've read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;Right. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't have asthma. Yeah. He-- I don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have, so. And I've thought about quitting before in the past, but I just don't- I just don't see how it's possible right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that. And I didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;Yeah, exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;How were you successful when you quit before?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;I don't know. I-I think about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just- I just did it. You know, I just- I just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;-and-and him having problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. So I-- that was just enough to-to say, Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?;you;know;what;I'm-I'm;not;going;to;risk;"that.""";"so.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;But they don't feel as scary to you now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;No, I mean, we're two separate people. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good about that. I-I don't let other people smoke around him. Um, so I, you know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;You're doing the best you can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;23;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;25;Client;Yeah. I-I know that I need to, and I, you know, keep every new year I say, Okay;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;It's on your to-do list. It's just not making it to the top?;this;year;I'm;gonna;quit;"smoking""";but;then;something;happens;and;it-it;just;doesn't.;And;quitting;doesn't;"happen.""";;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;29;Client;Probably like a 5 . Kind of in the unsure area. Like I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;30;Therapist;Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;31;Client;I know- I know all the ways it's bad for me. And I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. I don't want him to-to use any kind of-- I don't want him to chew or anything like that. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing, but I just don't know if I can do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;32;Therapist;Okay. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit. You have been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;33;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;34;Therapist;Where do you think we should go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;35;Client;I don't know. I-I'd like some help. I just don't know what kind of help I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;36;Therapist;Sure. Well, if you'd be interested, that's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful in their attempt at quitting. There's different medications you can try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;37;Client;I don't like medicine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;38;Therapist;Okay. There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with you. And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is such a stress reliever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;39;Client;That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if I have the time for all that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;40;Therapist;Sure. It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;41;Client;That would be really nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;42;Therapist;Okay. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;43;Client;I would like that. That would be great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;44;Therapist;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;45;Client;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;high;smoking cessation;46;Therapist;Sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi, Laura. It's good to see you again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Hi. Thanks for having me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Of course.  So, how have things been since our last chat?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Um, pretty much the same, I guess.  Still busy with school.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;That sounds like senior year.  Lots to juggle. So, what's been on your mind lately? What feels important to talk about today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Well, I've been thinking more about what we talked about last time, with the drinking and stuff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Okay.  And what specifically about that has been on your mind?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;I don't know... just... how it fits in, I guess. Or maybe doesn't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;"It sounds like you're exploring that a bit. Can you tell me more about what you mean by ""fits in""?";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Like, with my friends, it's just kind of what everyone does. But then I think about what I want for the future, like college and stuff, and it feels… different.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;So, there's a bit of a pull between what's happening socially now and what you envision for yourself later?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Yeah, exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;That's a really common experience.  It takes courage to look at those pulls and consider what's truly important to you. What are some of the things you value most right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Definitely my friends, my family… and, I guess, doing well in school so I can get into a good college.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Those are some great values.  How do you see alcohol fitting in, or maybe not fitting in, with those values?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;That's what I'm trying to figure out.  With my friends, it feels like it's part of hanging out. But my family… they'd be really disappointed if they knew.  And with school, I know it can't help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;So, there's a conflict there.  A tension between wanting to belong with your friends, honoring your family's expectations, and also keeping your academic goals in sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Yeah, that's exactly it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;It sounds like you're really thoughtful about this.  What are some of the pros and cons of drinking, as you see them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Well, the pros are… it makes it easier to relax with friends, feel like I'm part of things. But the cons are… the health stuff, the risk of getting in trouble, and how it could mess up my chances of getting into college.  And, honestly, sometimes I see how some kids get when they drink too much, and it's not a good look.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;That's a really insightful list.  It sounds like you've given this a lot of thought.  So, where does that leave you? What are you thinking about in terms of your own drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;I'm not sure.  I don't want to stop completely, I guess. But I also don't want it to be a big deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;So, maybe finding a balance?  A way to enjoy time with your friends without it becoming something you regret later?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Yeah, I think so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;That sounds like a reasonable goal.  What would it look like for you to find that balance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Maybe… only drinking a little bit, or not at all, when I have something important coming up, like a test or college applications.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;That sounds like a good starting point.  So, you're thinking about being more intentional about when and how much you drink?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;Okay.  So, let's say you decide to go to a party this weekend. How would you approach that differently, based on what we've talked about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;I could… maybe have one drink and then switch to soda. Or just not drink at all.  It depends on who's there and what's going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;It sounds like you're already generating some good strategies.  What makes you think you could pull that off?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;I think… I'm pretty good at sticking to things once I decide to do them.  And I know my real friends won't care if I'm not drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;That's great to hear. It sounds like you have a strong sense of self-efficacy. So, what do you think?  Would you like to try this out for a while and then we can check in again and see how it's going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;Yeah, that sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;Okay.  So, between now and our next session, your goal is to be more mindful of your drinking, to experiment with those strategies you mentioned, and see how they feel.  How does that sound?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;Sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;Great.  And remember, this is a process.  There might be times when it's harder than others.  If you run into any challenges, we can talk about them next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;Anything else you want to discuss today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;No, I think that's it for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;Okay.  Thanks for sharing, Laura.  I'll see you next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;Thanks. See you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;0;Therapist;You did your values clarification handout, and that was part of what I wanted to go over with you today. I wanted to hear about your values and just talk to you a little bit more about that. Do-do you wanna tell me what some of your top five values are?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;1;Client;Yes, um, my top value is family happiness, um, that's-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;2;Therapist;That's number one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;3;Client;-that's number one to me, especially now. I usually do this values clarification sheet, like, every two to three months-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;4;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;5;Client;-just to see if anything changed, and every time it has changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;6;Therapist;Oh. So, right now family value is the most important thing to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;7;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;8;Therapist;Family happiness?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;9;Client;Yes, it's the most important because it's a little lacking, so I know that that's something that is very important to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;10;Therapist;Okay. Would you like to talk more about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;11;Client;Yeah. Um, I can just pretty much say that my family hasn't been on one accord, so, like, if-- I feel like if we all just can fall in the middle, which I know everybody doesn't really follow that track. So, um, I think for my part, 'cause I can't change anybody, is to be more present and, um, just listen and understand my family members, and-and be able to voice what I feel as far as how important family happiness-happiness is to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;12;Therapist;Mm. Because even though it's important to you, maybe they don't know it's important to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;13;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;14;Therapist;Is that what you're saying? Yes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;15;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;16;Therapist;And you want them to know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;17;Client;And I want them to know how important it is to me, especially now, and I do this, like I said, every two to three months just to see where I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;18;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;19;Client;And, um, these definitely are different from-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;20;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;21;Client;What I usually pick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;22;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;23;Client;"Um, and then the second one I said is religion. Um, it was number one at first, um, but somehow with a big situation that happened in my family you kind of lose sight of your faith a little bit, which is normal. And not a lot of people-- They, uh-- Well, in my church home, i-it just seems like, ""Oh, you lost touch of God, oh my gosh, you're the devil.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;24;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;25;Client;You know? And it's kind of like, well we all face those challenges every day, we're not perfect, you know? And I feel like my faith is still there but it's-- You know, as long as it's still there, that's all that matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;26;Therapist;Right. So, right now, it really is important to you to put the family values first? And religion is still very important to you, but you feel like maybe you're losing faith a little bit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;27;Client;Yeah. I lost faith, and so I'm not afraid to say it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;28;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;29;Client;You know? And once you say [unintelligible 00:03:12] people that don't really feel like that's-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;30;Therapist;Because you know that other people experience it too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;31;Client;Yeah, I know that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;32;Therapist;So, you know it's normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;33;Client;I know that it's normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;34;Therapist;But sometimes it's not something that people talk about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;35;Client;Yeah, well, it's a-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;36;Therapist;Especially in the church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;37;Client;"Yeah, it's like a shock to them when you say something like that. And it's like, ""Well, we all go through things where we're just not sure, and--"" I still have a little bit, I'm not saying that I'm off track, you know? I still have a little bit to go on. And the little bit that I do have are the positive things in my life that I look at and I'm like, ""Okay, well, I'm not in this situation, so I'm thankful,"" and-";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;38;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;39;Client;"-you know, I'd still have faith to keep going on, but sometimes you feel as though, ""Where is God?""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;40;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;41;Client;You know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;42;Therapist;And it sounds like right now you're at a place of acceptance about that also.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;43;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;44;Therapist;Uh, that it's okay with you, and you-you know that it's gonna change because that's been your, uh, experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;45;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;46;Therapist;You've done numerous values clarification handouts and every time they're different-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;47;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;48;Therapist;-so you know that it's going to change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;49;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;50;Therapist;And you accept that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;51;Client;"I've accepted that. At first, I was like, ""Whoa,"" I think I was focused too much on the first time I did it-";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;52;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;53;Client;-then the second time that I did it-- I did five of these total-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;54;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;55;Client;"-but the second time that I did it I was so focused on, ""What did I read about last time?"" You know?";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;56;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;57;Client;So, and I just went ahead and blanked that out and I just went and I-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;58;Therapist;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;59;Client;"-compared and I was like, ""Oh wow.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;60;Therapist;I really applaud you for being open-minded enough to realize that where you are now is not necessarily where you are, that you don't have to always have it be the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;61;Client;"Mm-hmm, and that's what I felt wasn't-- At first I was like, ""Is that not normal?"" You know?";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;62;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;63;Client;But, I noticed people go through things every day. I go through things in life. Things are gonna change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;64;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;65;Client;Things do not stay the same. Um, you know, like, you may be here, you're gonna go there, you're gonna go over there, not necessarily saying you're gonna fall down, but your view on life changes the more experience, the more life, every day-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;66;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;67;Client;-every day your eyes-- Well, to me, my eyes have gotten broader, and broader, and broader. So-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;68;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;69;Client;"I don't limit myself to change anymore, I just kind of fill it out, and then [unintelligible 00:05:38] I'm like, ""Okay.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;70;Therapist;All right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;71;Client;That's cool, so I'll focus more on that, than on the unnecessary stuff in my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;72;Therapist;Mm-hmm. Do you feel that there are some parts of your life where you'd like to be more in line with your values, or do you feel like you're really on target with them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;73;Client;"Um, I mentioned before that it was kind of, like, out of place for me, because when I did this one in particular, um, as-as-- I stated that there were-- The other three were important to me, but I haven't focused on it so I'm like, ""Okay, it's important to me,"" so I lost track of that and the other three-";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;74;Therapist;The other three?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;75;Client;Um, number three was health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;76;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;77;Client;Number four is inner harmony, and number five is security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;78;Therapist;Inner harmony, health, and security-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;79;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;80;Therapist;are the other three?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;81;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;82;Therapist;And the top two are family happiness and religion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;83;Client;And religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;84;Therapist;Okay, and the three- the three other ones, inner harmony-- Let me see if I can remember them. Inner harmony, health and, what was the other one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;85;Client;Security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;86;Therapist;Security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;87;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;88;Therapist;Inner harmony, health, and security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;89;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;90;Therapist;You feel like you're not really paying as much attention to them as you would want to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;91;Client;"Yeah, because when I saw it I was like, ""Okay, yeah, that's one, that's one, and that's one.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;92;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;93;Client;But-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;high;adhering to family values;94;Therapist;Is it because a lot;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;0;Therapist;Hi, Hannah. Nice to meet you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;1;Client;Hi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;2;Therapist;So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;3;Client;Yeah. Um, yeah, I guess it kind of- it kind of started like five, six years ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;4;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;5;Client;Um, it kind of escalated a bit. Um, I've just recently moved out, um, from living with my parents. So just made it a bit worse, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;6;Therapist;Okay. Is this the first time that you've left home?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;7;Client;Yeah, I am- Yeah. It's the first time actually, yeah. Um, I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it'd be easier to stay at home, so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;8;Therapist;Okay. So it has been quite a big step and a big change and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;9;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;10;Therapist;So how has that, uh, changed things for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;11;Client;Um, don't know, it's kind of, I haven't really told anyone, so, I mean, it's made it like better in sense. I feel, hopefully this is, this is it like, it- it'll help, but I don't know. I don't like thinking that I've like have to do this. I never thought I'd like be the kind of person you'd have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;12;Therapist;Okay. So how do you feel about being here today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;13;Client;It's like scared. I don't know. Hopefully, it will help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;14;Therapist;Okay. So you'd, you're feeling a little bit anxious about today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;15;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;16;Therapist;Okay. So I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today. So it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years. Um, but just recently you moved out of home for the first time and, um, and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP. So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;17;Client;Um, I thought that they'd be better, but 'cause I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and I suppose actually a lot worse. So I'm-I'm just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don't really have any friends or anything. I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it's not-- I don't know. It's kind of scary because I've just been kind of-- that should just end the flight by myself, which I always thought I'd like, but I don't actually like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;18;Therapist;Okay. So what other kinds of difficulties that you have been experiencing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;19;Client;Um, I mean, I'm-I'm a photographer. Um, so I kind of-- It's-it's been stopping me a bit, my anxiety, from being able to get work and because every time, you know, there's, uh, an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people, I just tend to just turn it down. So it was kind of making things hard in that respect and um, just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone. So it's kind of stopping me from making friends and, you know, like relationships and stuff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;20;Therapist;Okay. So you said that, um, your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things. So they're, they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer, I guess that- that can be kind of a problem. And they're also stopping you or you feel like it's stunting you, uh, socially. You're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;21;Client;Yeah, yeah. Um, it was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously, I mean, my parents, so it's fine, but you know, they would, I'd go to places with, um, or I'd kind of have people there, but more and more, I'm just finding myself just staying in a lot. I mean-- I went like two weeks ago for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don't, I just don't want to-- I don't want that to happen. I don't want to lose everyone. So-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;22;Therapist;So you're kind of worried about how, where this is going to lead to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;23;Client;Yeah. Um, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;24;Therapist;So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in about five or six years ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;25;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;26;Therapist;So you would have been about 19.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;28;Therapist;And what was happening around that time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;29;Client;Uh, I guess I'd finished school about a year before that. Um, and I mean, I-I've always been a bit shy, um, at school, but it was never ever, uh, like it didn't really affect the things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, I guess. It just started when I- like my friends went to university, and, I don't know, I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there.I just stop going to parties or I'd just say no to invitations or I don't know, I thought my job would help because I mean, I love it. I've- I really like doing photography, but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on, so, which is my thing, you know, but-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;30;Therapist;What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;31;Client;I guess when it- I have to kind of be working with other people. Um, I don't like that. It's like when I'm trying to kind of- would do an event or something where there's a lot of people there, not just photographers, but actual, you know, if I'm like taking places with people that I don't know, I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean, I want to do them, but just is scary. So I just don't do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;32;Therapist;So I guess, tell me a bit more about what happens then. So let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with, uh, you know, it's going to involve, uh, photography with- with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction. What kind of thoughts go through your head?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;33;Client;Um, just, I mean, I get really hot and sweaty, and I don't-- I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid, and I feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking, I just can't do my job. And I'm just an idiot. And I mean, they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and-- I mean, I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else. So that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera 'cause I- then I can just put all my attention on that instead of having to, you know, be with other people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;34;Therapist;"Okay. So it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation and you think, ""People will look, people will stare, people will think I'm a weirdo."" So there's quite a lot about what you- what you think other the people will think. And how does that make you feel?";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;35;Client;Um, just makes me feel like an idiot, makes me feel like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anymore. I should just go home and I just-- I think I just don't want to be in that situation. I just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal and I'm just the freak, you can't, like do normal things and-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;36;Therapist;Okay. Can you give me an example of a-a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;37;Client;Um, like a work situation or just--?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;38;Therapist;Yeah, time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety, you know, that you're describing, you felt that kick in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;high;managing life;39;Client;Yeah. I was doing a job where it was kind of like a- a Nature issue and I was having to work with a lot of different people. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine. I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Hey, can I help you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Yeah, I hope so. Um, my workplace has just gone smoke-free. I-I'm not-not very happy about it. I'm gonna keep smoking, but I was wondering if there's anything that-that can help me like get through the day. It's like, you know, go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;So your workplaces went smoke-free and you're not too pleased, huh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;No. I'm not gonna quit smoking. I mean, I like it. It helps me relax. So, I mean, I don't see what the big deal is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;Okay. Tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day. It'll help with the-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;I mean, I smoke a little less than a pack a day. It's not too bad. Um, I've probably smoked for the last five years, but I-I-I mean, could quit if I wanted to, but I don't really want to right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;Okay. So you feel like, right now, smoking's a pretty important part of your life. It's not something you're ready to change, but if the time came when you did decide to quit, you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;Sure. I can quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;Okay. What makes you so confident?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;Well, I mean, I don't see why I couldn't, I-- although I have not ever tried to quit, it's just something that I do for fun, you know, on breaks at work, in the morning, and after work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;Mm-hmm. And so in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10, where one is, I'm not considering it at all, and 10 is, I'm definitely ready, I wanna quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;I am probably a two. I-I haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today, I- I'm totally not gonna quit smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;Okay. What made you say two instead of one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;Well, I mean, anything's possible. I mean, I-I guess I could maybe be convinced. Yeah. Is there some-- I mean, are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;Well, there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke. We have products that can help to replace nicotine, which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;Okay. Well, that’s good information. I mean, I'm not gonna do anything today. I just need to know my options, but that's encouraging. If I decided to quit smoking, I-I do have at least tools to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;Sure. And back to that scale, you mentioned, you said you were a two. What do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;I don't know. I guess if my friends, like if one of my friends decided to like quit with me, that would probably help too, but I-- all my friends love to smoke, so I don't see that happening in the near future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;Sure. I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free, if there will be some people at work who planning to quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;That's a good point. I hadn't really thought about that. That-that's a good idea. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;Okay. Well, it sounds like you're really here just for information today. I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;Okay. Well, thanks a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Therapist;So, Liz, what's something that you'd like to change or maybe that you're feeling two ways about right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;Um, I really want to start working out again. Definitely wanna get back in it, have a routine, and just be healthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;Okay, and-and why would you want to make this change?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;Um, I'm sick of feeling the way I do. I feel kinda sluggish. Especially with the winter coming, I think I want to have more energy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;Um, I don't like the way my clothes fit or don't fit me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;Just, I don't feel comfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;Yeah. So, you're not feeling comfortable with the way that, you said, your clothes fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;What are some of the reasons why, um, it would be good for you to kinda make this change?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;Um, I know exercise is-- in the past, has always made me feel good. I felt good about myself, and just in general, exercise, I know, makes me feel good. I want to be a good example for my kids. I want them to feel like that's a part of life-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;-exercising. So, I want-- I really just want to go get back in a routine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;So, to heal-- feel healthy for yourself as well be a good role model for your kids?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;16;Therapist;So, if you did decide to get exercising more into your daily routine, how would you go about doing it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;17;Client;Um, I don't know. I'd probably have to sit down maybe with my husband and try to figure out a good time for me to be able to do that, where he'd be home with the kids and I'd be going to do that, whether it's morning-time, evening, maybe the weekends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;18;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;19;Client;Just to find the time to be able to do it, or what works in our schedule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;20;Therapist;So, it's that balance of doing something for yourself, but it sounds like you don't want that schedule to affect too much into your family routine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;21;Client;Right, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;22;Therapist;So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important, where would you rate yourself on how important it is to start exercising more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;23;Client;Mm, I would like to say a seven or an eight, that that's how important it is to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;24;Therapist;Okay, and how come not at like a five or a six?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;25;Client;Because I'm really sick of being overweight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;26;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;27;Client;Not ha-- I just don't like being unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel good, so I'm motivated to change, it's just getting there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;28;Therapist;So, to summarize, it's important for you to do this. You're starting to feel sluggish, you're not feeling healthy, and you know that you've got other people in your family watching you, and you want to be a good role model for them to know that this is gonna be just a part of your life, is your exercise. Yet for you, you're struggling just a little with the logistics of when to schedule time for you so it doesn't interfere too much with your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;29;Client;Exactly, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;30;Therapist;So, knowing this, what do you think you'll do next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;31;Client;Mm, I'll probably, I don't know, find-- Now, while it's still somewhat okay outside, maybe pick days I'm gonna go for walks or runs, um, maybe look for a gym close to the house so that I know I can go there quickly or maybe that has daycare, um, yeah, maybe I'll just start to look for that, and find ways I can do it first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;32;Therapist;That's great. It sounds like you've got some options and leads on how- on how to get that done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;high;diet and weight loss management;33;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;0;Therapist;Hi [Client Name], thanks for meeting with me today.  I understand you're feeling frustrated about losing your phone call privileges. Can you tell me more about what's been happening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;1;Client;Yeah, it's ridiculous. I just want to call my mom, that's all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;2;Therapist;I can understand wanting to talk to your mom. It sounds like that connection is really important to you.  So, if I understand correctly, you've lost your call privileges recently.  What led to that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;3;Client;Some officer is on a power trip or something.  He said something about my bed and my 'attitude'.  It's petty. I just want to talk to my mom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;4;Therapist;It sounds like you feel the reasons given weren't justified, and it's definitely frustrating when you feel something important is taken away unfairly.  Help me understand – how has not being able to call your mom been impacting you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;5;Client;It's just… I talk to her almost every other night.  Now, nothing.  It's been a week.  It's hard.  My dad's birthday is tomorrow, and I really wanted to talk to her about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;6;Therapist;That makes perfect sense.  Your dad's birthday is a big deal, and it's natural to want to share that with your mom.  It sounds like this isn't just about any phone call, but specifically connecting with her, especially given the upcoming birthday. Is that right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;7;Client;Exactly.  I just wanted to wish my dad a happy birthday with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;8;Therapist;So, it’s not just the call itself, but the connection with your mom, especially with your dad's birthday tomorrow, that's really weighing on you. It sounds like this is more than just a minor inconvenience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;9;Client;Yeah, exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;10;Therapist;I've also heard that, up until recently, you've been doing really well here – consistently following the rules and being respectful.  This recent situation seems out of character.  It makes me wonder if there might be something else going on, perhaps related to your upcoming release in three weeks.  Sometimes, big transitions can bring up unexpected feelings. Could that be part of it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;11;Client;Maybe… I mean, yeah, I'm excited to get out, but also… it's a lot to think about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;12;Therapist;Absolutely.  Getting ready to leave can bring a mix of excitement and maybe some anxiety about what's next.  It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed by that.  It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now – the frustration of losing your call privileges, the importance of your dad’s birthday, and the anticipation of your release.  Is there anything you’d like to explore further about any of this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;13;Client;I just want to call my mom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;high;compliance with rules;14;Therapist;I understand.  Let's talk about that.  What are some possible ways we could work towards getting you back on track with your phone calls, especially with your dad’s birthday being so soon?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;0;Therapist;Hi Sal, thanks for coming in. I understand your asthma has been really difficult lately, and we need to find some ways to manage it so you can stay healthy and avoid future hospital visits. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;1;Client;Yeah, I definitely don't want to be back here. But the doctor said Oscar, my dog, might be connected to my asthma. It's ridiculous, I've had him for 12 years and he's never been a problem before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;2;Therapist;I hear your surprise. It's understandable to feel that way when something you've had for so long suddenly becomes a concern. You've probably seen some of the information we provide about managing asthma, and how pets can sometimes play a role.  What are your thoughts on that information?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;3;Client;Yeah, I've seen it. I even read it.  Honestly, all I've been focusing on is taking the medicine. I haven't really looked into all the other stuff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;4;Therapist;Thanks for being honest about that. I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like you've been primarily focused on the medication, which is important, but there might be other pieces to the puzzle we haven't explored yet.  Tell me more about what you understand about the connection between pets and asthma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;5;Client;Well, I don't really get it. I've had Oscar for 12 years. Why is it a problem now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;6;Therapist;That's a valid question.  It's not uncommon for things to change over time, even with long-term companions like Oscar. Sometimes sensitivities can develop, or existing ones can worsen.  What has your experience been with your asthma over the past year or so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;7;Client;It's definitely been getting worse.  I've had to use my inhaler more, and the attacks have been pretty scary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;8;Therapist;That sounds really tough, Sal.  It’s concerning that your asthma has been worsening, especially with those recent attacks.  I also know you have a young baby, John Carlo, and that you're very committed to his well-being. How does your asthma impact your ability to be the kind of parent you want to be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;9;Client;It's hard. Sometimes I'm so short of breath I can't even play with him.  That's why I want to get this under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;10;Therapist;It sounds like being able to be fully present for John Carlo is a big motivator for you.  So, thinking about that, and also considering your own health and the increasing severity of your asthma, what are your thoughts about exploring all the potential factors that could be contributing to it, including the possibility of Oscar playing a role?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;11;Client;I guess… I just really love that dog. He's part of the family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;12;Therapist;I understand.  It's clear how much Oscar means to you. It's a big decision, and it's okay to feel conflicted about it.  Let's explore this a little more.  What are some of the things you've considered regarding Oscar and your asthma?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;13;Client;I don't know… I guess I could try more cleaning, maybe get an air purifier?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;14;Therapist;Those are some good ideas.  Sometimes those strategies can make a difference.  We can definitely talk about some options and resources for managing pet-related allergies.  In the meantime, given how severe your asthma attacks have been, it’s also important to consider all the options, even the difficult ones, to ensure your health and well-being. Would you be open to discussing some of those other options as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;15;Client;I… I don't know.  It's just hard to think about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;16;Therapist;Of course it's hard. It's a significant decision.  No one is asking you to make any decisions right now.  Let's just talk openly about the possibilities, the pros and cons, and explore all the information so you can make the best choice for yourself and your family.  Would that be okay?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;low;asthma management;17;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Hi Carrie, thanks for coming in today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;What brings you in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;Well, I'm having an ongoing problem with smoking and trying to quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;So, you'd like to give up cigarettes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;Oh, I've been wanting to for a long time, for years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;So, at this point in your life, why is it so important to quit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;Well, I have a 15-year-old daughter, and she's very much against it. And there are health issues. I'm not getting any younger, and I have asthma and chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. I have a hard time breathing when I exercise, and it's socially unacceptable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;It's like being a leper in a non-leper colony these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;So, it's really important for you to be a good role model for your daughter, especially at this age when she might decide to smoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;Right. She's been expressing her feelings. She'll walk in and it's embarrassing for her friends, and in turn, it's embarrassing for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;So, you want to make her proud, and this would be an added benefit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;You mentioned several medical problems: asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. That must be scary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;When were you diagnosed with emphysema?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;I'm not sure. I remember when my daughter was five, it was humid, and I have trouble breathing in humidity. I was trying to get air at the window, and my daughter was so frightened she called 911. She thought she was going to lose me.  That was ten years ago. I've tried Chantix, unsuccessfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;Tell me about your experience with Chantix.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;I don't know if it's my lack of willpower, but I had very bad side effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;What kind of side effects?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;Nightmares, nausea, stomach problems, and agitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;Those are pronounced side effects.  I've heard that some people have success, but others experience significant adverse effects like you described.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;23;Client;Right, and it didn't stop me from smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;How long ago was that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;25;Client;Two or three years ago. I tried it a couple of times. I'd get a refill, thinking I could try again. I had friends it worked for, and they suggested the online support group, but I didn't do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;So, the online support wasn't a fit for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;27;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;You gave it a good try, but it wasn't a good fit.  You listened to your body – nightmares, nausea, those are serious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;29;Client;And the agitation.  Being my age, going through menopause, and having a 15-year-old… I don't need extra stress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;30;Therapist;So, you're looking for relief, not something that makes you feel worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;31;Client;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;32;Therapist;Have there been times in the past when you quit smoking completely?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;33;Client;Only when I was in the hospital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;34;Therapist;What's the longest you've gone without a cigarette, including being in the hospital?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;35;Client;Three days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;36;Therapist;That's a long time. What did you notice during those three days?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;37;Client;Constant thoughts about smoking, like a chocoholic craving chocolate. The first thing I did when I could smoke was grab any cigarette, any brand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;38;Therapist;So, the nicotine is the addiction?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;39;Client;Yes, and the psychological aspect too. I associate cigarettes with coffee, stress…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;40;Therapist;It sounds like it's paired with many things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;41;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;42;Therapist;Cigarettes can feel like the perfect drug, fulfilling different needs at different times. The downside is the health impact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;43;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;44;Therapist;It can take years off your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;45;Client;My aunt used to say, 'Another nail in your coffin.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;46;Therapist;What do you think when she says that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;47;Client;I used to be cocky and say, 'You were my role model, Aunt Kathy. I thought you were so glamorous like in the old movies.' That's what I associated with it then, but now I'm ostracized for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;48;Therapist;It's become harder to be a smoker. People make assumptions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;49;Client;Yes, and you have to go far to smoke. If you have a short break, you might not even finish your cigarette.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;50;Therapist;So, it's become very inconvenient as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;51;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Hi Carrie, thanks for coming in today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;What brings you in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

28;high;smoking cessation;33;Client;Only when I was in the hospital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;34;Therapist;What's the longest you've gone without a cigarette, including being in the hospital?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

28;high;smoking cessation;42;Therapist;Cigarettes can feel like the perfect drug, fulfilling different needs at different times. The downside is the health impact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;43;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;44;Therapist;It can take years off your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;45;Client;My aunt used to say, 'Another nail in your coffin.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;46;Therapist;What do you think when she says that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;47;Client;I used to be cocky and say, 'You were my role model, Aunt Kathy. I thought you were so glamorous like in the old movies.' That's what I associated with it then, but now I'm ostracized for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;48;Therapist;It's become harder to be a smoker. People make assumptions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;49;Client;Yes, and you have to go far to smoke. If you have a short break, you might not even finish your cigarette.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;50;Therapist;So, it's become very inconvenient as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;high;smoking cessation;51;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;0;Therapist;So, if I understand correctly, the report from Minnesota State, Mankato indicates you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence, and then taken to detox.  And you're 20, soon to be 21. Does that sound right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;1;Client;Yeah, I guess so.  It's kind of fuzzy. It was last week, and I was pretty drunk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;2;Therapist;It sounds like a difficult night.  This kind of incident could lead to suspension from the university. How do you feel about that possibility?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;3;Client;Hmm. I mean, not great. But I'm turning 21 in a couple of months.  Once I'm legal, they can't give me a minor anymore. And it's not like I'm a big drinker, not like some of my friends. I just need to be more careful, you know? Not get caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;4;Therapist;It sounds like you're thinking about how to avoid getting caught in the future.  I'm curious, what was going through your mind when you decided to drive after having six beers?  That could have put you and others at serious risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;5;Client;Well, I didn't hurt anyone. I did call my roommate for a ride, but he was really tired. I needed to get home somehow.  Honestly, it feels like he's partly to blame. I give him rides all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;6;Therapist;It sounds like you're feeling frustrated and maybe a little like you were put in a difficult position.  It's understandable to feel that way.  At the same time, it's important to consider the potential consequences of driving under the influence, not just for yourself, but for others too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;7;Client;Yeah, I get that.  But like I said, I didn't hurt anyone.  So, are we done here? I have class in 15 minutes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;8;Therapist;I understand you have to get to class.  Before you go, I want to make sure we're on the same page. The university has expectations for student behavior, and this incident doesn't align with those expectations.  We want to support you in being successful here, and that includes following the rules.  Do you see yourself being able to do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;9;Client;Look, I like it here. I get what you're saying, and I appreciate you talking to me. I'll think about what you've said.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;10;Therapist;Okay.  So, the next steps are that you'll be placed on university disciplinary probation. You'll also need to attend an alcohol education seminar, which has a $150 fee.  It's important to know that further violations could result in a more serious consequence, like suspension.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;11;Client;$150? Seriously?  That's a lot of money. I don't know if I can afford that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;low;compliance with rules;12;Therapist;That's understandable.  Let's talk more about that fee and explore some options. We can discuss payment plans or other resources that might be available to you.  It's important that you complete the seminar, so let's work together to figure out a way to make that happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Okay, David. So, you've had a rinse. How are you feeling?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Pretty good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;Would you like to take a look at the results?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;Yeah, sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;What do you think?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;Oh, that looks really nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;You got rid of that discoloration that was there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;Yeah, completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;I like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;Excellent. It went well. I did notice quite a bit of staining, actually. I'm wondering what you think might be contributing to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;Well, the usual suspects: smoking, wine, coffee – all of the above.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;All of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;Have you given any thought to quitting smoking at this point?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;Yeah, I've thought about it.  It's just… I hear it from everyone. I've tried before, and it didn't work. I get the lecture all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;So, it's like here I am, one more person, the next doctor saying, 'You need to quit smoking, David.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;Yeah, yeah, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;And I'm sorry, that's not how I mean to come across at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;Yeah, I know. I'm not an idiot. I know smokers are seen as… 'How can you still smoke?' It's just not that easy to quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;I understand. If it was as easy as doctors or your partner make it sound…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;…saying you have to quit…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;23;Client;Who wouldn't do it? You'd have to be a real fool not to do it if you thought it was going to be that simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;25;Client;I just hear it every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;Yeah. Tell me a little bit about your past experiences with smoking.  How long have you smoked, and what role does it play in your life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;27;Client;I've smoked for 40 years, since I was 14. I quit a couple of times, off and on in my 20s, but it's been pretty consistent. I can't see myself changing now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;29;Client;No matter what kind of talk I get or what new methods they come up with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;30;Therapist;It sounds like you've tried a lot of things, and it's not something you're currently interested in pursuing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;31;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;32;Therapist;Yeah.  I understand. It sounds like you believe cold turkey is the only thing that works for people who have successfully quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;33;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;34;Therapist;And that's what worked for people you know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;35;Client;Yeah, and then they fight the cravings. But it's my choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;36;Therapist;"Mm-hmm.  And it really is your choice. You're absolutely right; nobody has the right to tell you what to do.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;37;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;38;Therapist;Can I ask, though?  If there were a situation where you decided, 'I must quit,' what would that situation be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;39;Client;"Hard to say, because I already had open-heart surgery. That didn't do it.  And prostate cancer; that didn't do it either.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;40;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;41;Client;I don't know. I really don't want to quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;42;Therapist;So, this is something you pretty much see yourself doing for quite a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;43;Client;Yeah, quite a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;44;Therapist;Yeah. Okay. Well, I really appreciate you being willing to even talk about it. I understand that right now, this isn't something you want to pursue. Would it be alright if I brought it up again at our next visit? I know you said you don't want a lecture, but I am concerned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;45;Client;Okay, yeah. I'm always open to listening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;46;Therapist;As long as I don't talk too much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;47;Client;Yeah. I'm open to hearing about options.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;48;Therapist;Okay.  David, honestly, wherever you're at with this, we'll work with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;49;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;50;Therapist;Thanks for taking a few minutes to talk about smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;51;Client;Thanks, doc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;52;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;high;smoking cessation;53;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi, David. How are you doing today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Hmm, pretty good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;That's good to hear. I wanted to touch base about something I noticed during your rinse—you had some noticeable staining. Any thoughts on what might be contributing to that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Mm, well, the usual: smoking, wine, coffee.  Probably all of them, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;So, you're aware of some of the things that could be playing a role. Have you given any thought to quitting smoking, or is that something on your radar at all right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Yeah, I've thought about it. But honestly, it's just not something I'm interested in.  I hear it from everyone, and I've tried before—it didn't work. I get the 'you should quit' speech all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;It sounds like you've had a lot of people telling you what to do, and that can get old pretty quickly. I'm definitely not here to lecture you, David. I'm just curious about your past experiences with trying to quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;I've smoked for 40 years, since I was 14. I quit a couple of times in my 20s, but it's been pretty consistent since then. I just don't see myself changing now, no matter what anyone says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;So, you've tried quitting before, and it hasn't really stuck. That can be really frustrating. What do you think made it so difficult to quit when you tried in the past?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I don't know. It's just such a part of my life, I guess.  I've had open-heart surgery, prostate cancer—you'd think *that* would have been enough to make me quit, but it wasn't. I just don't see it happening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;It sounds like you've been through a lot, and smoking has been a constant in your life through it all. I hear you saying that right now, quitting doesn't feel like something you're ready to take on. Is that a fair summary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Yeah, that's about right. I know it's not the best thing for me, but I just don't see myself quitting anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;And that's perfectly okay, David.  This is your journey, and you're the one who gets to decide what's right for you. I'm just here to support you, wherever you're at in that process. If you ever *do* decide to make a change, I'd be happy to help in any way I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I appreciate that. I don't like lectures, but I'm always open to listening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Understood. I'll definitely keep that in mind. Would it be alright if we checked in about this again sometime in the future?  No pressure at all—just to see where you're at and if there's anything I can do to support you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Yeah, that's fine. I don't mind talking about it as long as it's not a lecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;[chuckles] You got it—no lectures, I promise. I'll make sure to keep our conversations, well, conversational. Thanks for being open to talking about this, David. I know it's not always an easy topic to discuss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Thanks, doc. I appreciate it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;Absolutely. And remember, wherever you're at with this, we'll work with it. You're in the driver's seat here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Okay. Sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Alright, David. Thanks for taking the time to chat today. Let's connect again soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Thanks, doc. See you next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Therapist;Hi, Natalie. I'm Dawn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;Hi, Dawn. Nice to meet you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;Nice to meet you too. Thanks for coming in today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;Thanks for having me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;Tell me a little about yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;So, I'm 28, and I moved to Arizona about six months ago. I really enjoy spending time with my family and friends when I can. Work keeps me pretty busy. But I'm really looking to make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not happy with where my weight is right now, so I thought it would be good to come and talk with you about some of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;So, you're feeling a little dissatisfied with your current health habits?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;Yeah. I'm starting to notice I feel more sluggish, and just not… My mood has shifted a lot too, which at first I thought was because it's getting colder outside. But I also think it might be related to my activity level, or lack thereof, and the foods I'm eating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;Okay, so you're experiencing some low energy, and you know from past experience that when you're more active and eating differently, you have more energy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;Right. Yeah. Especially when I'm more active, I notice the biggest change in energy and mood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;Tell me more about those previous times when you were active.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;Well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun. I think back now to how much I would cram into a 24-hour period and wonder how I did it. But I think part of it was because I was so physically active. I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically, to go to school full-time, socialize with friends, and do everything. So, when I think back to what was probably the peak of my life, when I felt my best physically and mentally, it was during that time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;You had tons of energy, like the Energizer Bunny, just going and going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;Yeah, exactly. And now it's not the same. When I get home from work, I'm exhausted. It takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer, thinking and working. That's probably been my biggest issue: when work ends, I just go home and don't really do anything. Just trying to unwind by watching Netflix or something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;So, your days are just as full now that you're working, but your energy level isn't what it used to be. Do you have any ideas why that might have changed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Client;"Well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't really optional. I *had* to go to practice, or I *had* to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school. Now, there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money. So that's definitely shifted. But I do feel an urgency to do it; it just seems like the missing step is actually going to a gym or somewhere to be more active. I think I *want* to; it's just the *doing* it that doesn't seem to happen.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;16;Therapist;Right. So, in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you were physically active. Now it is, and you're looking back and saying, 'I want to do things differently. I want to be more physically active than I've been.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;17;Client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think so. Not that I want to run a marathon, but I do think it would help me a lot just to have a better outlook on life and more energy if I were to pick up some type of activity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;18;Therapist;Great. And you've noticed that exercise has a mood-enhancing effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;19;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;20;Therapist;Tell me more about that. What specifically do you notice about your mood on days when you're physically active?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;21;Client;I'm just happier and more upbeat, and I think even my outlook is more positive. If I'm sitting in traffic and I haven't been physically active, I'll probably grumble about it. But if I'm sitting in traffic and I *have* been active, it's like I have a different perspective. I already feel like I've accomplished something that day. It just has a ripple effect into the rest of my day, making me more productive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;22;Therapist;Yeah, you feel more accomplished and less bothered by the little things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;23;Client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;24;Therapist;Okay, let me see if I've got this. You moved to Arizona six months ago, and you're trying to establish new routines. You're reflecting on the past few years, and you realize that in college, you were very active because you were an athlete. Now, it's up to you to choose physical activity, and you're realizing that not being active has affected your energy level and your mood. You're looking for more of both of those things: energy and a mood boost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;25;Client;Yeah. And also, as I mentioned, I'm not totally happy with my weight. I'm hoping that increased activity would have some impact there and maybe help me. If my activity level improves, then my nutrition might also improve along with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;26;Therapist;Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;27;Client;Probably about three or four months ago. My clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't comfortable. And I'm just not happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue before. I've usually been pretty okay with that, but in the last few months, I've had a more negative outlook on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;28;Therapist;Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like a bit of a cycle, and maybe the lack of physical activity has contributed to you feeling less confident. I wonder if that's also part of the picture, since you mentioned that's been a big difference from the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;29;Client;Yeah, I think the activity piece, and also the foods I'm eating, aren't that great.  That also affects how I feel about my appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;30;Therapist;Okay. So, you had strong self-confidence and a positive body image until a few months ago, and you're hoping to get back to that place where you feel good about yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;31;Client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;high;diet and weight loss management;32;Therapist;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;0;Therapist;Barbara Roberts?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;1;Client;Yes. Good morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;2;Therapist;Good morning. I'm Dr. Betty, one of the new GPs here. What would you prefer to be called?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;3;Client;Barbara is fine, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;4;Therapist;Okay, Barbara. I understand you usually see Dr. Brown?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;5;Client;Yes, he's my doctor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;6;Therapist;What brings you in to see me today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;7;Client;I've been having terrible trouble with my stomach, and Dr. Brown hasn't been able to figure it out. I was hoping you might be able to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;8;Therapist;I see. Tell me more about these stomach problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;9;Client;Well, I have almost constant discomfort. I often feel bloated. I swing between constipation and diarrhea. I get cramping, sometimes it's a stabbing pain. I frequently have the urge to go to the toilet, and I pass very smelly gas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;10;Therapist;That sounds like quite a few troublesome symptoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;11;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;12;Therapist;How long has this been going on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;13;Client;I can trace it back to a holiday in Egypt about four years ago. I had a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and my stomach hasn't been right since.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;14;Therapist;So, you think it started about four years ago after that trip?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;15;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;16;Therapist;What treatments have you tried?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;17;Client;Dr. Brown gave me muscle relaxants initially. I've also been to a health shop, and they've been very helpful, giving me various tablets and medicines for different symptoms. Oh, and I use Immodium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;18;Therapist;So, you're taking different herbal tablets depending on your symptoms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;19;Client;Yes, because the problems aren't the same every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;20;Therapist;So, you decide day-to-day what to take based on how your stomach feels?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;21;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;22;Therapist;Have you had any tests done?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;23;Client;Yes, early on I had a… gastroscopy, I think it was called.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;24;Therapist;The one where they put a tube down your throat?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;25;Client;Yes. And I also had a barium enema, which was very uncomfortable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;26;Therapist;I see. And what were the results?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;27;Client;They didn't find anything.  I don't think he's done enough tests. He said they didn't find anything and hasn't sent me for any more. He just sent me back to my regular doctor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;28;Therapist;It sounds like you're not happy with that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;29;Client;Well, I think the NHS is running out of money, and he's decided I've had enough tests. If you go online, there are loads more tests he could have done. If I had more money, I'd go private. I just don't think he's gotten to the bottom of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;30;Therapist;So, you feel like not enough tests have been done?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;31;Client;No, there are many more he could do, I'm sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;32;Therapist;Let me summarize: You've had these problems for about four years, with various stomach symptoms. You've tried prescribed and herbal remedies, and you've had some tests, but you feel they haven't been thorough enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;33;Client;Yes, that's right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;34;Therapist;How is this affecting your day-to-day life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;35;Client;"It's had a big impact. I went from full-time to part-time at work because I couldn't sit comfortably all day. Eventually, about a year ago, I stopped working altogether. I miss it. I miss my friends from work. We used to go out at least once a week. I also used to go to a exercise class, which I miss. But I wasn't comfortable doing the exercise; I was always worried I'd need to use the restroom. My husband and I used to go out for meals, but we don't do that anymore.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;36;Therapist;It sounds like your life has changed significantly because of these symptoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;37;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;38;Therapist;What does a typical day look like for you now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;39;Client;I potter around the house. I probably watch too much daytime television. I read a bit, but mostly I'm at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;40;Therapist;Have there been times in the last four years when your symptoms were better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;41;Client;Last year, my son got married. I was worried I wouldn't be able to cope, but surprisingly, I felt great for about three weeks in the summer, leading up to the wedding and the wedding itself. I hardly noticed my stomach problems then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;42;Therapist;That's interesting. Are there times when your symptoms are worse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;43;Client;"I'm having a bad patch at the moment. It's particularly uncomfortable. I notice it's worse when my husband is away; he travels for work a couple of times a month.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;44;Therapist;So, it's worse when he's away?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;45;Client;Yes. Maybe I think about it more then, I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;46;Therapist;What has Dr. Brown said about what he thinks is wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;47;Client;He thinks it's all in my head, that it's stress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;48;Therapist;And what do you think?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;49;Client;It can't all be in my head. I have too much physical pain. It's real pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;50;Therapist;Have you had any thoughts about what might be causing it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;51;Client;"I thought it might be an infection that didn't clear up. Sometimes I think it's IBS, like a friend of mine has. Other times, I wonder if it's an ulcer. On bad days, I worry it's cancer. My mother-in-law died of cancer; the doctor didn't investigate a growth until it was too late. So, I check myself at night to make sure nothing is changing.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;52;Therapist;So, you check yourself regularly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;53;Client;Yes, to make sure nothing is changing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;54;Therapist;Let me summarize: You've seen Dr. Brown for a few years, tried various medications (prescribed and herbal) with no real difference. You've had some tests, but you feel they weren't enough. You sometimes worry it's something serious, like cancer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;55;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;56;Therapist;What were you hoping I could do for you today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;57;Client;Since you're a new doctor, I wondered if you might have a fresh perspective. Maybe you know about new tests that my doctor doesn't. I was hoping you could send me for some different tests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;58;Therapist;So, you were hoping I'd order more tests?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;59;Client;Yes, I think there must be a test that would reveal something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;60;Therapist;I understand.  However, given your history and the tests you've already had, I'm not sure more tests are the best approach right now. You've had some of the main investigations, and your symptoms haven't changed much.  More tests might not show anything different.  It could be a waste of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;61;Client;So, you think it's all in my head too, like Dr. Brown?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;62;Therapist;No. You clearly have pain and physical symptoms that are affecting your life. But I think these things aren't always just physical or just mental. Sometimes they're connected. You mentioned that at your son's wedding, when you were busy and happy, your symptoms lessened. And when your husband is away, which you don't like, they seem worse. I wonder if there's a link between how you feel emotionally and what's happening in your life, and how much your symptoms bother you. Is that possible?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;63;Client;I can't see how my mind could cause this much pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;64;Therapist;I'm not saying the pain is *just* in your mind. But sometimes how we feel and what's happening in our lives can affect how we experience symptoms. Since medications and tests haven't helped, I wonder if a different approach might be better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;65;Client;What kind of approach?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;66;Therapist;Thinking about other areas of your life.  Over the last four years, your life seems to have become much smaller. You're not doing many of the things you used to enjoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;67;Client;I can't do them anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;68;Therapist;You've stopped doing them because you felt you couldn't, but I wonder if not doing those pleasurable things has contributed to you feeling unhappy, which could then make your symptoms worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;69;Client;I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;high;changing approach to disease;70;Therapist;I wonder if focusing on what you do with your day and bringing back some of those pleasurable activities, even something small like meeting friends, might improve your overall quality of life.  I'm also thinking about the tablets you're taking.  You're taking quite a few, and I wonder if we could review them and see which are helpful, which aren't doing anything, and which might even;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi Sarah, it's great to meet you. My name is Delwyn, and I'm a counselor here at the clinic. I understand from your nurse practitioner that during your recent annual exam, the topics of smoking and alcohol use came up. Would you mind telling me a little bit about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Yeah, um, last week I met with my nurse practitioner, and she's concerned about how much I'm smoking and drinking. I agreed to work on the smoking and try to cut back. But, regarding the drinking, I don't really think I drink that much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;So, you've decided you want to cut back on your smoking a little, but you're not really concerned about your drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Right, I mean, I don't drink that much, and honestly, it's just a good way to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;It's a nice form of stress relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Yeah, exactly. It's like that 'me time' at the end of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;A sort of escape from your hectic schedule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Yeah. I have a two-year-old son, and I work full-time. I also started going back to school. So, I'm trying to juggle everything. It's tiring, and at the end of the day, I just want to relax and enjoy myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;So, you're working, and on top of that, juggling being a single mom and going to school?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Yeah, and for work, I'm a server. I'm on my feet all day, and it's really tiring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;It's pretty exhausting work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Yeah, it's hard trying to please customers all day. And I'm worrying about making enough money to support my son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;So, you're not only doing really tiring work and going to school, but you're also worrying about your finances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Yeah, and with going back to school, I have to figure out how I'm going to pay for everything. It's a lot right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;It does sound like a lot you're trying to deal with. It makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;Tell me a little more about your drinking. How much are you drinking, what's the pattern, and what raised concern?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;That's the thing. I don't understand what raised concern. I don't drink that much. I've gone up to maybe two drinks a day, max.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;So, you're drinking perhaps two drinks a day. What have you heard about the recommendations for drinking levels?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Not much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Would you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;The recommendation for women is no more than three drinks a day, and no more than seven drinks over a week. The reason for those recommendations is to reduce the risk of accidents or chronic diseases like certain cancers, high blood pressure, and psychological problems. What do you think about all that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;It surprises me because two drinks a day doesn't seem like a problem or risky. I have family members who drink a lot more than that per day, and it's not a problem for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;It just doesn't seem that abnormal to you, especially compared to your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;No. I'm getting kind of annoyed, honestly. I agreed to work on my smoking, but with this drinking thing, it's like everything I enjoy is being taken away. If I give up drinking, what will I have to enjoy myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;You really feel like you need that reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;It also sounds like your drinking has perhaps increased a little over time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Yeah, I guess it has. Probably just from being so stressed. I'm in my second semester of school, and that's adding to everything. I'm trying to figure out childcare. My mom usually watches my son, but lately, she can't always. I'm always worrying. It's stressful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;So, it sounds like the more stressed you feel, the more you're drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;Yeah, I guess that's right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;Let me summarize. You have a hectic, stressful life, and you feel like you need some kind of reward or stress relief. You've noticed your drinking has increased, and the more stressed you feel, the more you're inclined to drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;Have you noticed any problems from your drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;No. The one thing is, there are evenings when I want to get my son to bed a little earlier so I can have alone time to unwind, maybe smoke, have a couple of drinks. I feel guilty about that sometimes because I should enjoy spending time with my son, but I just want to be by myself and relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;So, you've noticed it's starting to call to you in the evenings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;It's perhaps taking you away from things that are more important to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;And it doesn't feel good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;It sounds like there's a dilemma there. It's not the occasional drink that's the issue. It's the quantity and whether your drinking is escalating and interfering with things that are more important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;You've perhaps never seen it that way before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;No. It's hard to take in. I've never thought about it like this. I feel worried.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;It seems like it would be a hard pattern to change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;Yeah. It's part of my routine. I don't want to sacrifice something I enjoy, but I'm trying to be a good mom. I'm trying to go back to school. I'm trying to work. I don't know how I can do all that if I don't have a way to enjoy myself or relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;It seems like it would be difficult to change because it's important to you right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;Therapist;But there are things you value that you don't want the drinking to interfere with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;Therapist;Have you thought about other ways to cope with stress without relying on drinking so much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;Client;If there was some way to relieve my stress, I'd feel better, and maybe at night, I wouldn't feel like I had to unwind the same way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;Therapist;If you could tackle some of these stressful issues, that could make a difference. What would that be, for example?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;Client;My biggest problem is childcare. My mom usually watches my son, but she's been backing out lately. I'm worrying about having to call in sick to work or missing class. Worrying about that really stresses me out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;Therapist;So, having more reliable childcare could make a big difference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;Client;Yeah, definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;Therapist;It sounds like your mom has been an option, but perhaps not so much anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;Client;Yeah. She watches him so much. I think she's just getting stressed too. I feel bad because it's not her son, but I need something reliable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;Therapist;One thing that could make a big difference is if you could figure out more reliable, affordable childcare. That would help you not want to drink as much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;Therapist;Anything else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;Client;Most of my problems go back to money. If I had more money, I could afford daycare, I could work less hours. It's usually related to money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;Therapist;Money could make a big difference. You are working full-time and going to school to address that long-term. You have other ideas of how you might cope with stress better. Given our conversation, where are you with everything?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;Therapist;We started talking about how your drinking has drifted into a risky area, and it would be advisable to cut back. You feel like that's important to you and not something you want to do. We've talked about ways that could be made easier, but I'm not sure if you're ready to tackle that. Where are you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;Client;I'm ready to consider changing my drinking, but as far as actually doing it, I don't know. I have a lot of problems I'm trying to work out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;Therapist;It would be helpful if you could narrow it down to one thing. What would that be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;Client;Childcare, probably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;Therapist;It sounds like that keeps coming up as a main issue. There may be some resources I can point you towards. Have you looked into alternatives, more affordable, reliable childcare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;Client;Not really. I just usually see if my mom can watch my son, so I haven't really looked around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;Therapist;One thing you could consider is talking to one of our social workers. They specialize in helping people identify resources they;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;0;Client;Pretty good. It's been three months now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;1;Therapist;Nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;2;Client;Um, and—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;3;Therapist;Since the-- since you used, uh-- since the last time you used meth, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;4;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;5;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;6;Client;Right. It's been three months, and I've been doing pretty well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;7;Therapist;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;8;Client;Um, and I met a couple new friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;9;Therapist;Nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;10;Client;So—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;11;Therapist;So-so, uh, have-- last time we talked, you know, you were kind of cutting the-the ex-boyfriend out. This is because he was your dealer, so--;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;12;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;13;Therapist;And how is that going for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;14;Client;Right. It's been good. I haven't answered the phone when he's called-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;15;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;16;Client;-and a couple of my other friends have tried to call me as well, and I haven't answered the phone. Um, so it's been good for me to just reach out and like, meet a couple of new people, um, in the neigh-neighborhood that I'm living in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;17;Therapist;So it sounds like you've made some good changes. The change in your environment, and some of your behaviors, and, uh, and these new friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;18;Client;Yeah, the new friends, and I've been using the, you know, the breathing exercises you taught me, when I get-- start to feel a little stressed out, and I've been- I've been using those and it helps me. I go for a walk and do my breathing exercises, and it calms me down and kind of gets me through that time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;high;reducing drug use;19;Therapist;So it sounds like--;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;0;Therapist;So, thank you for coming in today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;1;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;2;Therapist;How are you feeling today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;3;Client;I feel great actually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;4;Therapist;Yeah? Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;5;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;6;Therapist;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;7;Client;I feel good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;8;Therapist;And so you did your clarifications, value clarifications-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;9;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;10;Therapist;-and What are your top five?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;11;Client;Yes. It was a good experience for me. It was different. It was different than usual. There were several things that were different, and the number one value that I put was self-respect. And I-I don't even know if self-respect has ever been in my top five let alone my number one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;12;Therapist;Really?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;13;Client;Yeah. And, um—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;14;Therapist;Do you have any idea why that is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;15;Client;I do have an idea, I think, why that is. Um, I think that there's been a few things that have happened recently and something that really came to my awareness, when I visited with my family, is that I have consistently through my whole life, probably, put other people first. And I have consistently, uh, almost not even considered myself in the equation. It was kind of sad in a way, at the time that I realized it. Uh, I didn't realize how severe it actually was, but I was kind of glad that I realized it because I feel like it's never too late to change-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;16;Therapist;True.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;17;Client;-and I feel like I can- I can, uh, respect and value myself just as much as I have other people. I know that's important. And I feel like when I do that, I'm a better person for other people as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;18;Therapist;Mm-hmm. By not putting yourself on the back burner so much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;19;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;20;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;21;Client;Because I get stressed, I get resentful, I get overwhelmed and, uh, out of- out of alignment, I guess, out of sorts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;22;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;23;Client;And I can't be the best- the best me possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;24;Therapist;For someone else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;25;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;26;Therapist;For your family?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;27;Client;For myself or for someone else, either way, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;28;Therapist;You think it is so much of a fact that you put yourself on the back burner that you were neglecting yourself, or that you were putting others so much before you that you just didn't even think about yourself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;29;Client;I-it's almost-- Like, I think that some people might not even think that I put that first, but in my mind and my emotions, I was carrying concern about what other people think, and I was letting that concern dictate my actions. Instead of letting my own values dictate my actions, I was letting what I thought other people wanted me to do to dictate my actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;30;Therapist;Wow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;31;Client;And that's something that I had done for so long, literally since I was a child, that I didn't even know I was doing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;32;Therapist;There's so much of your-- Part of your paradigm?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;33;Client;Yes, yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;34;Therapist;So, do you think sometimes you weren't even aware;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;35;Client;Not aware at all. Completely unaware. Totally unaware, yeah. And so to me, I feel like it's a celebration. I used to, uh, moan and complain about my childhood and about all the things that I didn't get to have, and all the cruel, mean things that people said and did, and I felt-- I feel like I had this aha moment where I realized that I could be my own parent, and I could give myself the things that weren't given to me, now. I can give myself a voice. I can give myself an opinion. I can live like that, if I want to. Nobody's stopping me from it, only me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;36;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;37;Client;So, that's what I want to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;38;Client;Mm-hmm.And it's the first time in my life I haven't felt guilty for saying that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;39;Therapist;The very first time that you can remember?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;40;Client;I would say so, yeah. I don't know if I've ever said that in front of people and not felt the least twinge of guilt for it. [chuckles];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;41;Therapist;That's not a selfish thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;42;Client;No-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;43;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;44;Client;-it's not, it's really not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;45;Therapist;Cool, that's great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;46;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;47;Therapist;Yeah. And so you felt you came about this change, and-and-and how does it make you feel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;48;Client;Well, it makes me feel jubilant. It makes me feel joyful. It makes me feel hopeful. It makes me feel like I count, like I matter. Uh, it makes me feel like I'm going to be able to do what I want to do with more joy and more passion, and less dread and a sense of responsibility, because one of the things that kind of happened along the way I really didn't notice, is that, um-- Like, let's say for example I like being a teacher or I like being a teacher or I like being a counselor to a certain degree but because of all the shoulds and all of the sense of responsibility and all of the caring about what people think, I started to lose joy doing things I actually enjoy doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;49;Therapist;Because you're- felt so obligated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;50;Client;Yes, because it turned into an obligation instead of just really really a sense of like you know passion you know. My passion is gone completely. I don't know I'm just happy to, I feel like I got back in touch with myself. It's like I was like lost for a while and now I'm like back again, yes, now I remember why I wanted to do this or like why this is important to me because it is actually one of my values to be and help, but it just has to be, uh, balanced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;51;Therapist;Yeah, is that on your top five also;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;52;Client;No, but um, the other ones I have on there, uh are, number two, inner harmony. For the same reason, like I feel like I need to harmonious within myself before I can be harmonious with other people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;53;Therapist;You get peace with yourself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;54;Client;Yes, and then I put family happiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;55;Therapist;That's very good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;56;Client;Yes, because I think that when I'm at peace with myself, uh, that automatically contributes to my family happiness. When I am unhappy with myself, I bring my unhappiness to my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;57;Therapist;Sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;58;Client;Uh, yeah, when I don't have self-respect and I am only giving my family a say on who I am and what I should do, I'm angry at them, I quarrel them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;59;Therapist;You feel resentful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;60;Client;I resent them, I really do, when I am in the mode. But when I just say, 'Hey, I'm a person of this family and I deserve this much time and energy and attention and just more than anybody else,' I don't care, you do what I do I do what I do life goes on [chuckles].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;61;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;62;Client;And then I have health and achievement, and to me, this one on achievement says a sense of accomplishment and to me that kind of goes along with what we were talking about earlier like I think I can show up and be a teacher and be a counselor in many different, uh, capacities. I could be your- I could be- I could be a teacher and I could be a really bad teacher. I could still be a teacher you know, I could show up an I could just do a really poor job and I could go home and I probably could keep my job for a while, it wouldn't be the first time right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;63;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;64;Client;But I don't feel good about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;65;Therapist;You don't feel fulfilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;66;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;67;Therapist;Like you've done anything helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;68;Client;Right, right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;69;Therapist;It's because you showed up and you gave out;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;70;Client;It's not enough for me to just show up and get my paycheck. That doesn't, I don't feel fulfilled so it-it, that's the way I see it going together with the helping. It's not just about helping to like look good or to exhaust myself or do what I think I should do but to really give something needy, something substantive, something real.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;71;Therapist;Meaningful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;72;Client;Yeah, meaningful, even if it's-it's small.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;73;Therapist;Sometimes it's the small things that really count, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;74;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;high;unidentifiable;75;Therapist;So all of these things put together feel like right now at this point in life, that it is really healthy change for you, like where you;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Interlocutor;Utterance_text;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;I don't know, I'm just having a lot of hard trouble trying to lose the rest of the weight. Um, right now, it's like no matter how much I try to exercise, run, or whatever, it doesn't matter like nothing else is coming off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;Right, so you've hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you're trying to do to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to be working on the scale?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;No, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong because I keep trying the exercise but nothing's happening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;Right. So you feel like you're spinning your wheels, you're doing more exercising and it's not showing results on the scale?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;And you're not feeling so good about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;No, and even when I'm coming home, like, I'll go to the gym and then I'm noticing nothing is happening and I'll come home and I try to talk to my mama about it or even my father, and no one even cares about it. Like no one wants to support in it anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;Uh, so you feel like you're doing this all alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;At home or you think that they'll be supportive but they're not giving- they're not giving you what you need?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;No, and specifically my father, he just-- Not only does he not want to support me with it but at the same time, he feels like I need to be gaining my weight back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;Oh, okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;So I—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;Tell me about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Client;It's as though by me losing weight, it's like I'm somehow disconnecting from my family, and he thinks that I'm trying to form myself to fit into like this perfect American picture and I just want to be healthy, I just want to have a good body and he doesn't think of it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;Therapist;Tanya, thanks for meeting with me today.  Let's talk about something you'd like to change, something you might be feeling ambivalent about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;Client;Well, I have a lot of anxiety, especially about this big test I have to take. I've been putting it off because I get so anxious and I don't trust myself to do well. It's always on my mind, and I know I need to just do it, but the anxiety stops me. I just don't want to feel this way anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;Therapist;So, this anxiety is a real obstacle, and it sounds like you're not confident you can manage it and succeed on the exam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;Client;Yeah, exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;Therapist;So, avoiding it feels easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;Client;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;Therapist;On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being not at all confident and 10 being very confident, how confident are you that you can manage your anxiety about this exam?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;Client;Maybe a four or five.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;Therapist;Okay, a four or five. That's not a two or three, so you've got some confidence there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;Client;Right. It's been so long coming, and I still have a ton of anxiety, but I think I'm taking that first step. That's why I'm at a four or five.  It's still scary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;Therapist;You mentioned you've actually scheduled the exam this time, after putting it off before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;Therapist;And you've rescheduled it in the past because of anxiety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;Therapist;What's different this time that makes you think you won't reschedule again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;Client;Well, it's just been hanging over me for so long. I need to do it. If I don't pass, I have to wait three months to retake it, which means three more months of studying. If I do pass, it'll be such a weight off my shoulders. I think about it every day, and I'm just sick of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;Therapist;So, the thought of how good it will feel when it's done is a real motivator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;Client;Yes, but then the negative thoughts creep in. You know, with anxiety. I worry about failing, about people asking me how I did, and being embarrassed if I don't pass. That makes me really anxious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;Therapist;You want to avoid those feelings that might come up if you don't succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;Therapist;Tell me about a time in the past when you were anxious about something, you did it anyway, and it turned out well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;Client;A few years ago, I had to do a recording for work. I was terrified and tried to get out of it.  When I finally played it, it was one of the best recordings I'd ever done. My supervisor and our national consultant were shocked, because of how unconfident I usually seem. I don't really like compliments, they make me anxious too, but it felt good because I really didn't trust myself, and I did a good job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;Therapist;So, that experience boosted your self-confidence, and maybe even changed how others saw you. You liked that feeling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;Client;Yes, I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;Therapist;It must have been brave to do something so daunting and be so successful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;Therapist;How can you connect that experience to what you're facing now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;Client;I think it's the same anxiety I have about this test. But if I pass, I could have that same feeling I had with the recording, that feeling of doing a good job. I'd love to have that again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;Therapist;So, you want to create opportunities to have that feeling again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;Therapist;You mentioned feeling proud of yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;Therapist;To wrap up, you started at a four or five for confidence. What would it take to get you to a seven, to feel more confident?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;Client;Well, the test is soon. I think practicing and seeing how I do might help. If I do well on practice tests, my confidence might go up. And maybe just having faith in myself, instead of assuming I'll fail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;Therapist;So, positive self-talk could make a big difference.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;Therapist;So, to summarize, you're anxious about this upcoming test, which you've rescheduled before. But this time, you seem more determined to get it done. You've even recalled a past experience where you were anxious but successful, and you felt proud.  It sounds like you're ready to take this exam and remind yourself that you can succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;Therapist;Okay, Tanya, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;Client;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi Andrea, thanks for coming in. I'm meeting with all the students to talk about life, goals, and behaviors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Why don't you start by telling me a little about yourself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;My name is Andrea, I'm in the marching band, I play the tenor sax. I'm also in the jazz band and wind ensemble, and I'm an IB student.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Wow, music's a big part of your life. How long have you been playing saxophone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;About four years, but I've been involved in music for about ten years. I started with violin for six years, then clarinet, and then found the saxophone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;That's great. And how long have you been in marching band?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Since freshman year, so three years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;And how do you like it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;It's fun, a lot of work, long summers, but fun. I really like the group setting, working with classmates, and putting on the show. It's exciting, especially at competitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;That sounds awesome. Do you have a lot of friends in band?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I have two groups, friends from class and friends from band.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;Great. Tell me about your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I have an older brother, nine years older, my parents, and my dog, a golden retriever named Charlie. He's eight years old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Nice. What are your plans after high school?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;I'm planning on going to school to become a doctor. I'm interested in psychology or psychiatry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;Big dreams. Have you started thinking about schools or majors?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Psychology, maybe. I haven't thought much about schools, everyone wants to go to the Ivy Leagues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;And how are your grades?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Pretty good, high three-point something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Good. What do you do for fun on weekends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;I usually go out with friends, to the movies or someone's house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;Is there ever alcohol involved?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Sometimes, honestly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;How often do you drink?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;It depends on schoolwork. When it's light, maybe every other weekend, or three weekends a month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;So, quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;A little, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;How much do you drink when you do drink?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;We don't get blackout drunk. It's more of a tipsy thing. I have gotten blackout drunk before, but I learned my lesson, didn't like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;Got it. So you've had some heavy drinking experiences. What's the most you've ever had?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;How many drinks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;It was a lot. It was my first time, like three or four cups, but mixed drinks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;So you're not sure how much exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;And your friends drink too?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Yes, some of them. Not all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;How much do they typically drink?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;More or less the same. Now, the most we'll have is maybe one cup after that one time, sometimes one or two, but they can be strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;So it's one cup, but not one standard drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;Right, it's a typical red party cup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;Okay. You're actually drinking quite a lot. It puts you in a high-risk group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;A little bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;It means there's a higher chance of negative consequences, like car accidents, other accidents, fights, sexual assault, health problems, or alcoholism. Have you thought about these things?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;Not too much. Since it's with my small group of friends, and we usually sleep over, I haven't worried about drinking and driving or sexual assault. But I haven't thought about alcoholism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;It's good you're not drinking and driving, but you're still drinking a lot. Let's talk about making some changes. I think you need to stop drinking like this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;Do you think you could quit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;49;Client;Yeah, I think I could. I don't need it. It's just something we do to get the party going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;50;Therapist;So, does that mean you're going to stop?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;51;Client;I'd probably start by telling my friends, 'Hey, I don't think I'm going to drink today.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;52;Therapist;That doesn't sound very convincing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;53;Client;It's one thing to control my own drinking, another when everyone else is drinking. There's pressure, like, 'They're going to think I look stupid.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;54;Therapist;How are you going to quit without your friends thinking you look stupid?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;55;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;56;Therapist;Are they really good friends if they're going to give you a hard time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;57;Client;My close friends wouldn't have a problem. But the ones I'm not as close to might ostracize me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;58;Therapist;It sounds like you might be better off without them. They're maybe not very good friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;59;Client;Probably too judgmental.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;60;Therapist;I think we should set a goal for you to stop drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;61;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;62;Therapist;And I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;63;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;64;Therapist;We'll set the goal, and you'll come back in a couple of weeks to talk about it and make sure you've stopped. What do you think?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;65;Client;I think it's possible. If I make a good plan, I think I can follow through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;66;Therapist;Great. The plan is to quit, and you're going to stop hanging out with the friends who aren't supportive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;67;Client;Yeah, I think I can do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;68;Therapist;Are your band friends drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;69;Client;Not really. The ones who drink more are my class friends. My band friends are focused on band.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;70;Therapist;That's good. Focus more on band.  My other concern is if you want to go to medical school, you won't get in if you're drinking like this. College will be hard, especially pre-med classes. Have you thought about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;71;Client;Not too much, honestly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;72;Therapist;Setting this goal to quit is really important. It sounds like it shouldn't be too tough, especially since you can just stop hanging out with the people who drink a lot since you have other friends. Do you have any questions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;73;Client;What should I say when my friends ask why I'm not drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;74;Therapist;You could tell them you thought about it and realized it's going to mess up your schoolwork, it's a risk to your health, you don't want to become an alcoholic or get liver disease, you don't want to drive drunk or get in accidents or fights. You could mention stories about kids at parties who get drunk and do stupid things, and it gets posted online.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;75;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;76;Therapist;That ruins their social life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;77;Client;And professional life too. I don't want that to come back to haunt me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;78;Therapist;So, tell your friends you realized there are too many bad things about it, and you're just not going to do it anymore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;79;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;80;Therapist;And you can tell them to stop too. That would be good. You'd be a good friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;81;Client;It would be easier if we all worked together to become better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;82;Therapist;Exactly. Any other questions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;83;Client;No, I think I'm good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;84;Therapist;So, I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple of weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;85;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;86;Therapist;To make sure you've quit drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;87;Client;Okay. Sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;88;Therapist;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;0;Therapist;Hi Mary, how was your day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;1;Client;Fine. Where do I sign?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;2;Therapist;Right there. You don't seem in the mood to talk today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;3;Client;Not really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;4;Therapist;It seems like you had a tough day at school. I noticed you missed first hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;5;Client;Yeah, whatever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;6;Therapist;It doesn't seem to concern you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;7;Client;It's the same thing every day. I don't know why. I signed the paper, why all the questions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;8;Therapist;You're wondering about the point of these visits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;9;Client;Yup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;10;Therapist;Would it be okay if I explained the program again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;11;Client;I guess so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;12;Therapist;I'll be stopping by daily to check in, make sure you're following the GPS requirements, and just get to know you. That's my role as your caseworker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;13;Client;So you just want to know my business?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;14;Therapist;It can seem nosy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;15;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;16;Therapist;Some clients struggle with understanding that I care. You've expressed a goal of getting off this program quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;17;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;18;Therapist;Being here when you need to be is one way to do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;19;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;20;Therapist;But you still seem annoyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;21;Client;Yeah. I'll be here if I have to be, but I can't promise I won't leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;22;Therapist;You're not sure you can do this successfully?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;23;Client;No, it just feels like, why do you need to know my business? Why do you care?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;24;Therapist;It must be confusing. You have other people involved, the courts, your mom's concerned, someone else is checking in. It's overwhelming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;25;Client;It's a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;26;Therapist;And there are all these rules.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;28;Therapist;It must be tough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;29;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;30;Therapist;Some clients value their freedom, they don't realize how much until it's gone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;31;Client;Right, that's the only thing I wish I had now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;32;Therapist;Your freedom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;33;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;34;Therapist;How could you get your freedom back?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;35;Client;I guess sign your papers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;36;Therapist;That's one step. What else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;37;Client;Not do this again, so I don't have to be stuck in my house with all these visits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;38;Therapist;So that's motivation, not repeating what you did, because you don't like these visits?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;39;Client;Yup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;40;Therapist;Okay. I appreciate you signing the paperwork, even though it's annoying. Thank you for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;41;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;42;Therapist;Anything else you want to add before I leave?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;43;Client;Not really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;44;Therapist;I'll be back later today then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;45;Client;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;46;Therapist;Alright. Bye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;high;compliance with rules;47;Client;Bye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Jacob, everything looks normal on your physical exam. Any questions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Okay. I see you filled out the alcohol and drug questionnaire. Can we go through it together?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;What we talk about is confidential. I only tell your parents if you give permission or if I'm worried about a danger to you or someone else. Makes sense?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Okay. I see you marked that you sometimes use alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself, or fit in. Can you tell me more about your alcohol use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;It's not a big deal. Sometimes with friends, we'll drink a few beers or rum and cokes when we're hanging out or at a party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;How many do you usually have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Three or four, probably. I don't keep track.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;And how often?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Probably about once or twice a month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;Okay. You drink with friends, three or four beers or mixed drinks, once or twice a month. How long have you been doing that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Probably since last October.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;About six months. What do you like about drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;I don't know. It's fun with friends, like at a party at someone's house, drinking with people we don't know. It tastes good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;So you feel relaxed and have fun, and you like the taste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;Are there any parts you don't like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;I don't like hangovers and throwing up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Have you ever blacked out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;No, but that happened to someone I know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;Any problems related to drinking, like at home or school?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;I missed first period once because of a hangover. Mom got mad and grounded me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;So, negative consequences, trouble with your mom and missing school.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Yeah, but I only missed school once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;I see you haven't ridden with or driven a car after drinking. Correct?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;That's great. As your doctor, I'm concerned about your drinking. Things can go wrong, like injuries. Even without excess, your brain is still developing and sensitive to alcohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being not ready at all and ten being very ready to stop drinking, what number would you pick?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;Probably a five.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;Why not a lower number?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;I'm tired of getting into trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;What could you do to avoid that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;Not drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;Have you tried stopping?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;Some people your age try stopping for a while to see how it feels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;I could probably do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;How long could you go without drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;Could you go two months?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;Yeah, probably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;What would make it easier?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;I could drink something else, like coke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;Anything else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;Hang out with friends who don't drink, or invite them to parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;Anyone you can talk to for support?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;Client;My friends who don't drink would be happy and support me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;Therapist;Great. You've identified reasons to stop, like hangovers and getting into trouble. You've also got strategies, like spending time with friends who don't drink and having non-alcoholic drinks. That's a great plan. I'm proud of you. How about you make an appointment for two months from now, and we'll see how it's going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;0;Therapist;Welcome back       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;1;Client;I suppose my expectations are a bit clearer as to why I'm here. It made me think about how much money I've been losing recently. So  Catherine. I'm interested to hear what you've been thinking about since our last session. What was different about your thoughts coming in this time?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;2;Therapist;Okay  yeah. I'm happier to be here.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;3;Client;"Mm-hmm.  so there's a shift from last time?  My sense is we'll be able to work well together. After our last session  I thought  ""Here's a young woman with some energy to get things together."" So  really  what we'd like to talk about today is getting a sense of the things that would be good to work on over the next nine months together.  ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;4;Therapist;One of the things we touched on last time was this issue of gambling. You were talking about how it had gotten you into trouble with your family.  Thinking back       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;5;Client;Yeah. I'm happy to explore it.  you mentioned you thought you deserved it  and there was some thinking around that. How open are you to exploring that from some different angles?     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;6;Therapist;Good. Sometimes       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;7;Client;Hmm. I don't know  when we start to open things up  it can feel a bit uncomfortable. How do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those feelings in the past?     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;8;Therapist;Yeah. How would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice in our session together?  I probably shut down a bit.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;9;Client;Um. I'm sure you've already noticed. Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;10;Therapist;Yeah  I don't know  probably fidget.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;11;Client;"Okay.  that's okay. So  what would be really helpful  since I might miss it  is if you could just say  ""Ken  I'm starting to tune out here  starting to get uncomfortable."" That would be really helpful.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;12;Therapist;Yeah? Thanks for that. So       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;13;Client;I suppose it's really serious if I want to get out of my debt. Credit is piling up  let's think about the gambling. Last time  you told me that you get a buzz  and it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of  and you said you owed one of your friends some money. How serious do you think this issue is to address?   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;14;Therapist;Okay. On a scale of 1 to 100  and Mom and Dad aren't bailing me out anymore  so I suppose I've got to sort it out myself.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;15;Client;About 80.  how important is it to you to sort this out?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;16;Therapist;About 80? Right up there. And how confident are you that you can actually get it sorted and get on with life?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;17;Client;I'm going to say I'm completely confident.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;18;Therapist;Really? On a scale of 1 to 100       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;19;Client;What  where does your confidence sit?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;20;Therapist;Well  my confidence to stop?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;21;Client;It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle. When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night  to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. We don't know whether stopping is the right answer here. But your confidence to sort it out.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;22;Therapist;So  I had a bit of a flutter. You know  I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit at the bar on my own.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;23;Client;Oh  you gambled last night with them? When they stopped  did you stop with them  or did you continue?    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;24;Therapist;Okay. You were saying before that you didn't really have the money because you owed your parents money  I had to stop halfway because I ran out of money.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;25;Client;Yeah.  and they weren't bailing you out anymore.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;26;Therapist;So       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;27;Client;Mm-hmm.  it seems like you're still engaging in the behavior  still creating some problems?     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;28;Therapist;How do you feel when you think about that?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;29;Client;I don't know       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;30;Therapist;Yeah.  but I'd like to get back on track.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;31;Client;I'm not really planning on spending my life in debt. I don't mind traveling       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;32;Therapist;Okay. It sounds really important. What are your dreams? Where do you want to be in five years?  and I've got friends who are saving for trips. I'm 25 and working in retail  and I have four credit cards  so I won't be doing any traveling anytime soon.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;33;Client;Maybe I want to have traveled and found the man of my dreams. Kids maybe       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;34;Therapist;"It seems like you're considering your next steps. ""Do I continue with my current lifestyle  but I'm not going to be a decent mom the way I am at the moment. I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt at this rate.      ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;35;Client;"Mm.  and you were quite the party girl, as you mentioned last time. Do I live a party-girl lifestyle  or do I have some other dreams to follow?"" They're hard calls to make.     ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;36;Therapist;What's your hunch? Which direction feels best for you at this point?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;37;Client;Party girl at 30 is a bit sad       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;38;Therapist;Where in particular?  really. It's been fun up to now  but I really do want to travel.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;39;Client;Egypt       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;40;Therapist;What is it about Egypt?  always.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;41;Client;Oh       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;42;Therapist;No  I just think it's fascinating. The outlook  the culture  the history. Somewhere I've always wanted to go. It's not the safest place at the moment  but...   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;43;Client;Since I was young  that's true. But things could be very different in the future. How long have you had this idea?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;44;Therapist;How much does your current lifestyle take away from that dream?  early teens.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;45;Client;I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;46;Therapist;So  I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;47;Client;I believe cutting off some of my friendships. Since that's part of their lifestyle.  there are some decisions to make about which dream  which path you want to follow. What do you think would be the hardest part of taking that pathway to traveling and realizing that dream?     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;48;Therapist;So       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;49;Client;It seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. I'd like to take the first step  this is something you've been thinking about for a while. How far away do you think you are from making some decisions about that?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;50;Therapist;What is the first step for you?  but that's going to be easy.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;51;Client;Probably cutting up the credit cards for a starter       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;52;Therapist;It's hard being in that environment. So  and trying to restrain myself  and not be led into temptation. You know  if the pokies are at the pubs  just don't go to the pub.   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;53;Client;Um  how have you found ways to manage that?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;54;Therapist;I think being tough with yourself is important  I haven't managed it to this point. Um  I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;55;Client;Mm-hmm.  but there are some things you can do. You've already identified a really good strategy. Thinking about who your friends are and whether they'll support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt. And the other idea you talked about was cutting up your credit cards.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;56;Therapist;So       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;57;Client;Mm-hmm.  a couple of really good ideas already.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;58;Therapist;So       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;59;Client;Mm. Yeah.  that's some work we can continue to do. I asked before what might be the hardest thing  and you identified your friends and habits. Could that mean that some of your friends are also wondering about where they're going and what they want to pursue their dreams?     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;60;Therapist;We talked about where you might be in five years and which path you want to take. You seemed very clear about it. Something we can do is get some very concrete things in place to support you in that. What's one thing you can do between now and our next session?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;61;Client;Find the scissors. Cut up the credit cards. Then       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;62;Therapist;So  I don't know if the debts are still going to be there  but I've got to find a way to pay them off.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;63;Client;That would be good.  some budget advice will be helpful. We often put people in touch with a budget advice service. It's a great service. Let's talk about how we can organize a meeting with them.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;64;Therapist;Okay.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;high;reducing gambling;65;Client;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;Client;So       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;Therapist;Okay. Earlier in our conversation  my doctor seems to think my blood pressure's a little high  but I really don't think there's a problem. I eat really well  and she suggested I watch my caffeine  but caffeine is not a problem for me.   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;Client;Well  you mentioned feeling like it might be causing some agitation. So  where are we? Do you feel like you do have some agitation from coffee  or is it no problem at all?    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;Therapist;Yeah.  sometimes it makes me a little jittery  and I have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of my co-workers. Working in the hospital  they don't really look favorably on going to the bathroom frequently. But it keeps me awake  it keeps me aware  it makes me more able to do my job better. So I really don't see that it's a real issue.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;Client;Maybe my blood pressure is a little high       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;Therapist;So  but…      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;Client;Mm-hmm.  let me see if I have this right. You've got some positives: the awareness  feeling on your game.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;Therapist;And then there are some negatives: your co-workers       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;Client;Gotta stay on  your boss not wanting you off the hospital floor too frequently.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;Therapist;Yeah  yeah.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;Client;Yeah. Sometimes  and then the blood pressure. Does that sound about right?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;Therapist;How about frequency? Do you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking?  like I said  it does kind of make me a little jittery  and I'm not as happy and relaxed as I normally am. But I really like it  and it makes me more aware of what's going on  and I feel like I'm much more observant.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;Client;Yeah. I have about four cups a day.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;Therapist;And that feels about right to you?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;Client;Yeah. I mean       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;Therapist;Yeah. What would happen if you looked at reducing that habit? Would that get rid of some of the problematic things?  the co-workers that work at night bring in a carafe. I can only imagine what their bodies are like.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;Client;Reducing it? How much are we talking?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;Therapist;I don't know. You tell me. You're drinking four a day.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;Client;Mm-hmm. I gotta have that morning cup. I really like waking up and that whole ritual       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;Therapist;Yeah.  making the coffee. I just really like the flavors.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;Client;So I definitely don't want to give that up.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;Therapist;I gotcha. So that one's important.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;Client;Mm-hmm.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;Therapist;And then       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;Client;Yeah.  of course  working a 12-hour shift  the afternoon cup to keep me going until the evening is a really good idea too.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;Therapist;I think that's great. So you've identified one of the four that you might be willing to try letting go of for a while. What do you think of that?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;Client;I think that does sound all right.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;Therapist;Okay. Good.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;Client;I think I could do that.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Tell me what you know about the flu shot.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Well       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;So you're thinking it's really just for people who are vulnerable to illness?  I know the flu can be pretty bad  but I'm in pretty good health  so I don't really feel like I need it. It's kind of just more for old people  right?   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;Would it be okay if I shared a little more information with you about the flu vaccine and its importance?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;Okay.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;You're right that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean you would probably do okay if you got the flu. But we do know that the elderly are more at risk       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Okay.  pregnant people  babies are at risk of having serious complications from the flu  and by you getting the vaccine  that helps prevent you from passing it on to other people.   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;Having shared that information with you       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;Well  how do you feel about the idea of the flu vaccine?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;Mm-hmm.  my grandparents probably wouldn't handle the flu very well  and my co-worker is pregnant too.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;So       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;Okay  yeah  I guess I should get it for their sake.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
51;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;Yeah.  so you've got some people in your life who are vulnerable to possible illness  and making this decision to get the flu shot will help protect them.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Okay.  Laura. Thanks for coming in. I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here. Basically  I'll be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester. We'll talk about whatever's going on in your life. I'll ask you some questions about your goals and what you like to do for fun. It's pretty casual  just a chance for me to get to know you.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Why don't we start by having you tell me a little bit about yourself?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Okay. My name is Laura       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Okay. What do you like to do for fun?  and I'm 17 and a senior in high school.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Mostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Mm-hmm       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Yeah  and what do you do when you're hanging out? Do you go to football games  go to parties?     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;Okay. What kind of hobbies do you have?  if it's school-related  maybe like a game or two  or go to the mall  like  to shop or go to the movies or something  and at night  maybe like a party or something if someone's throwing one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;Oh  I like to read  and I like to go outside and take walks and hike and stuff. I'm very outdoorsy.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Well  cool. What are your plans for after high school?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;That's great. What do you think you'll study?  I plan to apply to college and maybe have a good career.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Well       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Oh  I'm looking at journalism  maybe pre-law.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Which is a little different  neat.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;Yeah  but…      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Thanks.  that's a really good goal.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;It's hard work to get into law school. Are you doing well in school? What kind of grades do you get?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Yeah       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Okay. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?  I'm doing okay. I'm getting mostly A's and B's  so I'm pretty good.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;Okay. Do you know where you're going to apply to college?  I think all my grades are A's and B's.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Okay. What made you decide maybe law school or journalism?  I'm not sure yet  but I'm looking into schools in the area  maybe I'll leave home or something.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;Okay. Great. Sounds like you have really good goals  well  I'm definitely not a math or science person  so I started looking at careers that I might like.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Um  and you're working hard in school. You said that when you're going out with your friends  you like to hang out and shop and go to parties  so do you drink alcohol?    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;Okay. How often do you think you drink?  not really. Maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;Mm-hmm  maybe like once or twice a month at the most.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;Yeah.  so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;Okay       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;Possibly  so that's maybe like 20 times a year.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then?  yeah.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;Yeah       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;Okay. What do you think is the most you've ever had?  I guess you could say that.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;But you've been drunk before?  just two drinks at a party at the most. I don't like to drink a lot. Getting drunk is not something that appeals to me. I just have a drink in my hand so my friends won't bug me about not drinking. It's just to look like I'm actually doing something. Most of the time  I don't even drink at all.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;Okay. So the most you've ever had is two drinks in a day.  no  not really  maybe tipsy  but not like drunk.   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;Okay. Interesting. Do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;One of the things that's really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. It's a really big problem. Even around here  yeah.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;No  we have kids die every year from drunk driving accidents.  Have you ever done that? Have you ever gotten in the car…      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;Okay. How much do your friends drink?  I have never drunk-driven and never got in a car with a drunk driver.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;Okay. At these parties you're going to  I have some friends that drink more than others. My close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that  but I know that there are people that drink a lot more.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;49;Client;Yeah. There are kids that drink a lot more than I do. Definitely.  are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;50;Therapist;And do you hang out with them?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;51;Client;Not really closely. I know who they are       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;52;Therapist;Mm-hmm  and I'll say hi  but they're not really close friends.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;53;Client;Um  so even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;54;Therapist;Yeah  yeah. That makes sense.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;55;Client;Yeah.  so there are a lot of other dangers of drinking  like car accidents  other accidents. People will fall or break things. A lot of people end up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and falling down. As a girl  it's really important to be careful because you could be sexually assaulted.   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;56;Therapist;Especially if you've been drinking       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;57;Client;Yeah  then you're at a lot more risk. Have you thought about that?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;58;Therapist;Mm-hmm.  yeah  I have. That's one of the main reasons that I don't like to drink that much.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;59;Client;So…       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;60;Therapist;People get in fights more often when they've been drinking.  There have been a lot of kids       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;61;Client;Yeah.  even at this school  who've gotten in trouble because they were drinking  and someone took pictures and put them on Facebook.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;62;Therapist;And then their parents find out       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;63;Client;Yeah. Definitely.  or the school finds out. We have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol. It can really get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy. Have you thought about that?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;64;Therapist;But you're still drinking.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;65;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;66;Therapist;Uh-huh. Do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney?  yeah  I mean  I guess it's the thing to do at a party.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;67;Client;Um       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;68;Therapist;Mm-hmm.  definitely not. That's why I don't try to drink that much. Just…      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;69;Client;…make it look like I am       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;70;Therapist;Mm-hmm. So  kind of.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;71;Client;Okay.  I guess what we need to do then is talk about some goals for how to be safer.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;72;Therapist;Obviously       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;73;Client;I definitely agree. I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol  you shouldn't be drinking at all. What do you think about that?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;74;Therapist;Mm-hmm. So  the ones you mentioned  like health-wise  so I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;75;Client;Um  do you think you can quit?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;76;Therapist;Okay. So  yeah  I mean  it's not a really big part of my life.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;77;Client;Okay.  I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;78;Therapist;That's going to be your goal. That's really why we're here       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;79;Client;Yeah  to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decision. Can you quit this weekend then?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;80;Therapist;Okay  yeah  definitely. I'll just not have a drink.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;81;Client;Um  and then what about your friends who are still drinking?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;82;Therapist;Okay  I really can't control what they do  but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;83;Client;Well  and what if they won't?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;84;Therapist;Yeah. Probably if your friends won't quit drinking  then  I guess  I'll just try to hang around them less or something. I'll try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;0;Therapist;Hello Scott.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;1;Client;Hi.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;2;Therapist;We were talking earlier       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;3;Client;I do.  and you said you wanted to talk about exercising.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;4;Therapist;What's going on with that?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;5;Client;Well       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;6;Therapist;I think you just need to sit down and write down a list of reasons why you need to get back to the gym  I just can't seem to get back in the gym. I used to work out quite a bit  but in the last couple of years  I stopped going. I got busy  and now I'm out of the habit  and I feel like I need to get back.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;7;Client;Okay. All right.  and then on the other side of the list  put down ideas about what's going to help you get there.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;8;Therapist;What gym do you belong to?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;9;Client;I belong to the Sport Fitness Center.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;10;Therapist;Okay. How far away is it from your house?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;11;Client;Just a couple of miles.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;12;Therapist;Just a couple of miles. So you could ride your bike or walk there.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;13;Client;If I walked that far       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;14;Therapist;Well  I probably wouldn't even need to go to the gym  right?     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;15;Client;…strength training.  I don't know about that. It's really important that you get not just your cardiovascular exercise  but also your weightlifting  the…    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;16;Therapist;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;17;Client;That would be important.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;18;Therapist;Yeah. So why do you want to… what do you want to do with that? Do you want to look different       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;19;Client;Well  or…?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;20;Therapist;Okay.  I would feel better. I'd be able to wear my clothes. I've been growing around the middle  and I'd like to go back to where I was  get into a 34  36 waist.   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;21;Client;I'm more comfortable. I feel better. I think that's the main thing.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;22;Therapist;Okay. Your health is more important than your looks. I understand what you're saying       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;23;Client;Yeah  but it would be great to get back in those jeans.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;24;Therapist;Mm-hmm. Well  yeah. I'm not getting any younger.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;25;Client;Yeah.  I think you know what to do. You've done it before.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;26;Therapist;Yeah. It's just a matter of doing it.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;27;Client;I've got to make time.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;28;Therapist;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;29;Client;I've got to make time.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;30;Therapist;Yeah. That might mean giving up an hour of sleep       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;31;Client;Yeah. Okay.  getting up an hour earlier  and going there and getting it done then. That's what I do.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;32;Therapist;Yeah. So when I see you next time       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;33;Client;Okay.  I'd like you to experiment with getting up an hour earlier. Getting healthier is more important than sleep. And then bring that list back that we talked about.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;34;Therapist;Okay?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;35;Client;Okay.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;36;Therapist;All right       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;37;Client;Okay. Very good. Thanks.  so I'll see you next week.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;high;managing life;38;Therapist;All right. Bye.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;0;Therapist;Hi       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;1;Client;Pretty good.  Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise  the social worker here at the clinic  working with Dr. Fields and the team. I wanted to talk with you about how it's been going since you got home from rehab.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;2;Therapist;Yeah?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;3;Client;Yeah. I'm glad to be there.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;4;Therapist;Yeah. What are you really glad about?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;5;Client;Well       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;6;Therapist;Yeah.  I'm glad to see my dog  he's very cute  and it just feels good to be home.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;7;Client;Yeah. My garden is coming along       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;8;Therapist;I understand that getting home was your goal. It sounds like you've been able to enjoy parts of it. How's the physical therapy and Tai Chi going?  and my neighbors… It's good. It's good to be home.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;9;Client;Well       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;10;Therapist;I'm wondering if something happened that led you not to go. You look a little down.  I didn't go to physical therapy or Tai Chi this week.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;11;Client;Yeah. I had a little semi-fall. I didn't fall down completely       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;12;Therapist;So you've been working really hard through this whole thing  but I still had the wobblies. I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would get me further along than they have. I still don't have the balance. So  I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard  that maybe I should cut back.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;13;Client;Yes.  to get home.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;14;Therapist;And you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;15;Client;Yeah.  taking care of your house.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;16;Therapist;And you had this semi-fall       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;17;Client;Yeah  and you're feeling like maybe you were pushing too hard?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;18;Therapist;Yeah.  yeah.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;19;Client;So I cut back       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;20;Therapist;Yeah  and I don't know if I should even continue the Tai Chi because it's very demanding.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;21;Client;It's beautiful  yeah. It's a lot of work.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;22;Therapist;What are you concerned about?  but… yeah.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;23;Client;That I'll fall again.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;24;Therapist;Mm-hmm.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;25;Client;I'll really fall and hurt myself. If I don't move around so much       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;26;Therapist;Yeah  there's less chance that I will.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;27;Client;No.  yeah. So you don't want to hurt yourself.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;28;Therapist;What are your concerns? It doesn't sound like you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;29;Client;No       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;30;Therapist;Mm-hmm.  it was just more scary. It was like a signal that maybe I'm doing too much.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;31;Client;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;32;Therapist;What are you concerned will happen if you get hurt?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;33;Client;If I lose my balance and fall down       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;34;Therapist;It feels like the only way you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything  I could really get hurt  and then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore  and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to stay home.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;35;Client;Yeah. Yes  to just hunker down.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;36;Therapist;Yeah  you've put it very well  hunker down.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;37;Client;Watch TV and pet my dog. Not to that extreme  yeah.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;38;Therapist;Mm-hmm.  but yeah  I think maybe I was pushing too hard.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;39;Client;I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I think the physical therapy… I can understand that.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;40;Therapist;Yeah. The physical therapy is helping you build your strength.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;41;Client;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;42;Therapist;Which might have helped you break your fall this time. I'm wondering what you remember Dr. Fields saying about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;43;Client;She said that they did studies and found that it was really preventative. She was really enthusiastic       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;44;Therapist;Yeah.  and she does it herself.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;45;Client;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;46;Therapist;So you're feeling a little like it didn't work       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;47;Client;"That's a strong word  like  ""I was doing my Tai Chi  and look  I fell.""   ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;48;Therapist;"So you're questioning whether it might be useful. It comes down to what works for you. I'd like to work with you  ""betrayed."" A little  but I know it's true. My friend who does Tai Chi loves it. Maybe it's just not for me.     ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;49;Client;Right.  as I know Dr. Fields would  to build a plan to help you feel as safe as you can in your home.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;50;Therapist;What do you think about that?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;51;Client;Absolutely. I'm feeling a little frightened.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;52;Therapist;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;53;Client;What if I fall down and nobody comes around       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;54;Therapist;Yeah  and I'm lying there for two days?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;55;Client;I'm alone.  right.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;56;Therapist;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;57;Client;So…       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;58;Therapist;It really strikes you that you're there alone       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;59;Client;I think there are some things that could be done. People who live in residence have a cord they can pull  and this could happen. What thoughts do you have about that?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;60;Therapist;Yeah  but how do they get to the cord? Is there anything else I could do to communicate if something does happen?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;61;Client;I think I saw something like that on TV. Does it really work?  yeah. What's worked for a lot of people is a lifeline. You wear it around your neck  and if you need help  you push the button.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;62;Therapist;It does really work.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;63;Client;They sell so much stuff on TV.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;64;Therapist;Right. There are a couple of different products       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;65;Client;Yeah. I'm feeling a little scared.  but it can really help and give you a sense of security.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;66;Therapist;Mm-hmm.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;67;Client;It's probably a signal to make some changes.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;68;Therapist;Mm-hmm.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;69;Client;I don't want to go back to the hospital. Do I have to?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;70;Therapist;We're going to work with you to help you stay home as long as possible and be safe. What do you think that will take? The lifeline is a possibility.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;71;Client;I definitely want to do that.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;72;Therapist;Mm. What else would it take for you to feel safe?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;73;Client;Maybe a refresher on the things they showed me in the house when I first came home. Maybe support       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;74;Therapist;Mm-hmm.  maybe a buddy  some way to be reminded. I was moving along  and things were feeling more positive  but now it's like two steps forward and three steps back.   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;75;Client;Is there support somehow? My daughter calls me       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;76;Therapist;So you'd like a little more support and connection. Would you like some suggestions?  but she lives in Seattle. I don't want to impose on my neighbors or my friends.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;77;Client;Yeah.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;78;Therapist;We have case management services. Someone comes in and checks with you at home       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;79;Client;Yeah  helps you figure out things that need to be done  gives you a refresher on safety at home  and helps you connect with other services. How does that sound?    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;80;Therapist;I was going to say  that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;81;Client;Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. So  I would consider the senior center. I know you were really active there before. I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;82;Therapist;Yeah. It sounds so crazy  keep moving?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;83;Client;Yeah.  doesn't it? It feels like inside  moving is unsafe.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;84;Therapist;We know we can't make perfect safety       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;85;Client;Really?  but the more you move and the more active you stay  the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;86;Therapist;Yes.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;87;Client;Oh       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;88;Therapist;We can't prevent all of it  okay.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;89;Client;Okay. I'm willing to start again  but we can make it less likely.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;90;Therapist;Mm-hmm.  so to speak.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;91;Client;Yeah. It's scary.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;92;Therapist;Yeah. It takes a lot. You're the only one who can know what you're willing to work through that fear for.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;93;Client;I'm willing to work through my fears to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there since my husband and I got married       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
56;high;managing life;94;Therapist;Mm-hmm. That's a strong enough motivator  and I don't want to give it up yet.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Mr. Johnson?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Yeah?       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;I'm here to talk to you about your cholesterol and the medicine your doctor prescribed.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;I talked with my doctor about my medicine. That's his job.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;It's my job too       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;To be honest  to help you understand how to use your medicine and give you information about getting the most benefits from it.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;Your doctor told you that if your cholesterol remains elevated  I'm not even certain I'm going to take the medicine. I know I've got high cholesterol  I've got to get that down  but this medicine can cause severe muscle weakness  and I just can't afford that. I'm a truck driver  and I haul those heavy boxes.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Yeah  you're at risk of stroke or heart attack?      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;The side effect is very rare  down the line  but…     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;Right now  it's not really something you need to worry about  and the risk of stroke or heart attack is much worse.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;I understand that. But like I said  it's the muscle weakness I'm concerned about. That's the present. I've got to do my job.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;Why don't you just give me the medicine? I'll take it home  it's very rare. If you feel some muscle weakness  you'll let your doctor know. It's not permanent. It won't get to the point where it affects your job.     ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;You really need to take it. The muscle weakness is rare. If you feel it  and I'll think about it. I'm worried about my job.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;Sure. Fine. Just…  let your doctor know. He can take you off or switch you. It's not permanent.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;14;Therapist;It's not permanent.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;15;Client;Whatever.       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;16;Therapist;A stroke or heart attack is much worse       ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;17;Client;Okay  so make sure you pick up your medicine as you're on your way out. One every day to get your cholesterol down.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;low;adhering to medical procedure;18;Therapist;Okay?  sure. Fine.      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Hi Mrs. Smith, my name is Terri, I'm one of the nurses who works with Dr. Fields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Well, I remember you. Yeah, we met once before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;Yes, I think when you were in last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;And I know that, uh, Dr. Fields talked with you last time about maybe trying a tai chi class to see how that would go, and I wanted to-to check in with you and see how tai chi went.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;Well, I went once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Yeah and, um, it was very-very beautiful to see and the instructor was very nice, but I felt kind of self-conscious because I'm still in my walker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;And I had to sit in the chair. I couldn't, you know, do what they were doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;So, it's-- it was-- I simply felt self-conscious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;Uh-huh. So, you thought it was beautiful and you liked the instructor, but you were a little self-conscious because you were in a chair?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;A lot self-conscious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;Therapist;A lot self-conscious, uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;Therapist;What were you hoping to achieve with the, um, by going to tai chi?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;Client;Well, like Dr. Fields told me, it helps with balance, and I'm still having the wobblies. So, I was really hoping that I could get to the point where I could benefit from what they had to offer. Um, yeah, mostly my balance, mostly my balance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;Therapist;Uh-huh. So, you're hoping that it would help with balance, but you didn't see the- maybe the results you were looking for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;19;Client;Not yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;20;Therapist;Not yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;21;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;22;Therapist;Uh-huh. What is your overall goal? What are you working towards?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;23;Client;I wanna go home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;24;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;25;Client;Yes, I really do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;26;Therapist;Mm-hmm, and what is it that's important to you about getting home?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;27;Client;[sighs] Everything. I want to be with my little dog.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;28;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;29;Client;He's really so cute, and I miss my garden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;30;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;31;Client;And I just miss being independent, going to sleep when I want to sleep and getting up when I want to get up and-and, uh, cooking for myself. The independence. Sure I miss being independent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;32;Therapist;Uh-huh. So, you're wanting to get home to your dog, your garden, back to your life, your independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;33;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;34;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;35;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;36;Therapist;What do you think you need to do in order to be able to achieve that goal of getting home?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;37;Client;Well, they told me that I need to be able to walk down the hallway and back, even with the walker, being secure and not with the wobblies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;38;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;39;Client;And I haven't gotten there yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;40;Therapist;And do you agree that that's what you need to do in order to be able to get home?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;41;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;42;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;43;Client;I-I don't want to fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;44;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;45;Client;I-I've had friends that had that happen. So, um, I-I agree a little, with some hesitation, but I do agree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;46;Therapist;Uh-huh, and tell me how your physical therapy is going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;47;Client;Oh, it's better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;48;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;49;Client;It still hurts. It- it's-- I'm getting better. I'm-I'm getting better. It's not quite as painful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;50;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;51;Client;Yeah, so-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;52;Therapist;So, it sounds like, um, you can see that you're making some progress in physical therapy-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;53;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;54;Therapist;-and that you were hoping that the tai chi would help you with the wobblies. Uh-huh?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;55;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;56;Therapist;And so, are you wanting to go back to tai chi?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;57;Client;[sighs] Um, yes-yes I-I do because I-- my friend, I think I told you, really, really loves it and I just, I wish I could go back, and yes I do. I'm not making much sense, but I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;58;Therapist;Uh-huh. I think it's important, um, that you know that you're the one who has to make the decision about whether or not tai chi works for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;59;Client;Oh, I don't really know yet after just one time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;60;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;61;Client;Yeah. It's-it's-- I can't make that-- It wouldn't be fair for me to say it does or doesn't. It didn't that one time, but you know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;62;Therapist;So, you haven't seen the results that you want yet-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;63;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;64;Therapist;-but because Dr. Fields has recommended it and your friend has-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;65;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;66;Therapist;-and it sounds like you like the instructor-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;67;Client;Yeah, I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;68;Therapist;-it sounds like you'd like to try and give it another chance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;69;Client;Yeah, I would.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;70;Therapist;So, what has to happen in order for you to get to tai chi again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;71;Client;Well, I'd have to make the arrangements again, that was a little complicated, and, um, I'd have to get my head straight about feeling self-conscious, because I-I know that nobody's really looking at me, but I have to convince myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;72;Therapist;Uh-huh. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;73;Client;Yeah, and the arrangement, arrangements a little complicated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;74;Therapist;Uh-huh. So, how confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10 with one being not at all confident and 10 being very confident that you can make the arrangements in order to get to tai chi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;75;Client;That I can make the arrangement?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;76;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;77;Client;Five.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;78;Therapist;Five.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;79;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;80;Therapist;Uh-huh, so-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;81;Client;I-I mean, I know I can, but it's really difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;82;Therapist;Uh-huh. What is it that makes it a five instead of a one, no confidence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;83;Client;That I'm doing it by myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;84;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;85;Client;And I would really fe-- If I could have some sup-- Like if somebody could help me do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;86;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;87;Client;My-my daughter can't visit that often and, um-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;88;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;89;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;90;Therapist;So, in order for you to feel more confident, you would like some help in making those arrangements?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;91;Client;I would.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;92;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;93;Client;I would.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;94;Therapist;And is that something that your daughter can do for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;95;Client;Well, she's-- she could, but I'd have to wait at least a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;96;Therapist;Okay. Um, so is that something that you'd like us to help you with?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;97;Client;I would.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;98;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;99;Client;Yeah, yeah. Is that possible?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;100;Therapist;Sure we can make those arrangements with the rehab center. They have a van-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;101;Client;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;102;Therapist;-and-and they've done this for other patients so we can certainly make those arrangements if you'd like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;103;Client;That would- that would be good. And then as far as feeling self-confident, I'd have to do that myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;104;Therapist;Okay. So, are there any other barriers or obstacles in the way to you getting to tai chi?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;105;Client;Um, I can't think of any.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;106;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;107;Client;That's-that's the main thing-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;108;Therapist;All right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;109;Client;the arrangements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;110;Therapist;Well, it sounds like you can see that you're making some progress in your physical therapy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;111;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;112;Therapist;And that you're wanting to give tai chi another chance, and that if we can help make arrangements for you to get there with the van to the rehab center, that you'll give it another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;113;Client;That's-- Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;high;adhering to medical procedure;114;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;Therapist;How are you doing today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;Client;I'm good, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;Therapist;Good. Why don't you fill me in on what's been going on since I saw you last?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;Client;Um, I guess everything's fine. I think my caseworker mentioned something about community service that I have to do or something. I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;Client;I'm not sure of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;Therapist;So she talked to you a little bit about it, but it sounds like you're kind of unsure exactly the details.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;Client;Yeah, I know that she said I have to get so many hours in, but I don't- I don't know. I kind of was half-listening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;Therapist;Okay. So why don't you tell me what you remember from having your conversation with your case manager? What do you know so far about community service?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;Client;I know that I have to get it done by the end of my probation, except I forgot like how many hours or if I'm supposed to find it or someone else is gonna find it for me or I-I told you I'm confused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;Therapist;Okay, gotcha. So, you know, that it needs to get done-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;Therapist;Yes.-you know;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;Client;"Yes.  you have till the end of your probation-""		";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;Therapist;-but you're a little fuzzy on the details.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;Client;Exactly, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;Therapist;Okay. Um, so maybe if it's okay with you, I can share with you some of, um, the requirements, maybe go over the details a little bit more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;Client;Yeah, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;Therapist;Is that all right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;Therapist;Okay, great. Um, so with your community service I know you've got 25 hours left to do, um, so that does need to get done by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a really great resource to help you find a place where you can do it. So I know in the past some clients have done their community service at food pantries or shelters, or anywhere in the community that's not, you know, a family member or a friend. Um, the urban ecology center is a really great place. You can kind of work outside, work with younger kids. Do any of those options seem like a fit that you might be interested in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;Client;Um, yeah, I just, so I still have to find the community service hours myself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;Therapist;So that's something that you can work with your case manager on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;Therapist;So, um, that's something you can absolutely ask her or quest- or me some questions about, but they'll be able to come and bring you some options-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;Therapist;-of places that you can work with, some phone numbers to call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;Therapist;And that is something that we'd kinda like to see you do on your own, but if you're really feeling like you're struggling, those are phone calls that either you and I can make together or you and your case manager can make together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;Client;Okay, so I would do that. And then do you know, can I get all the 24 hours in in like a weekend or how does that work?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;Therapist;Well, I mean, 24 hours in a weekend sounds to me like it might be a lot of time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;Client;[unintelligible 00:02:20];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;Therapist;I can- I can hear that you are really eager to just get it finished-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;Client;Oh, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;Therapist;-and get it out of the way. Maybe I know in the past it's been helpful for some other clients to sit down and take a calendar and just mark out, okay, I'm gonna do five hours this day, I'm gonna do three hours this day, two hours of this day. Does that so-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;Client;Yeah, I think, just to keep track of it better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;Client;I think it's a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;Therapist;And then, you know, it might be, I definitely think that if you're committed and it's summer break, it's something you could easily get done in a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;Therapist;What other questions do you have for me about community service?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;Client;I think that's it. I think I was just worried about who was gonna do it for me, but I know I have to, I guess, do it myself and that 25 hours has to be done. It seems like that's the time I'd have to get done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;41;Therapist;Yup, absolutely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;43;Therapist;But you know that if you have any more questions, you can always come to me or your case manager and we're here for- to be a support for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;44;Client;All right, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;Therapist;You're welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;0;Therapist;So Tom, this infection has been pretty painful for you, but we have antibiotics. If you take them faithfully for ten days, I'm sure your infection will be gone. Can you do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;1;Client;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;2;Therapist;Do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;3;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;4;Therapist;Let's take a look. It says that on occasion, you use drugs for non-medical reasons. Which drugs do you use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;5;Client;I do some meth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;6;Therapist;Snort it, smoke it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;7;Client;Snort it, always snort it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;8;Therapist;Don't inject it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;9;Client;Mm-mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;10;Therapist;Use any other drugs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;11;Client;Just some alcohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;12;Therapist;How often do you use meth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;13;Client;Um, two, three times a month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;14;Therapist;So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;15;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;16;Therapist;Only snort it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;17;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;18;Therapist;Well, as I think you know, methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. The amount you're using puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. That contrasts with someone who is addicted, a heavy user. It's not a healthy category because people who use methamphetamine tend to experience several consequences. One of them is sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your methamphetamine use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;19;Client;Yeah, it could be because I was high when I had unprotected sex, and I would not do that if I were not high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;20;Therapist;So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;21;Client;Definitely, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;22;Therapist;It seems to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your judgment?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;23;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;24;Therapist;Anything else happening with methamphetamine in your life? Is it affecting you in any way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;25;Client;No, I mean, no. Like I said, I only do it in clubs, with my friends, two or three times a month at the most. I don't think it's really having other impacts. But I'm concerned about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;26;Therapist;I'm concerned about it too, and I'd recommend that you stop using methamphetamine altogether. There are a lot of reasons for this, but that's my recommendation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;27;Client;I understand, but I think that would be a hard thing for me to do. I know I should, but that's like my whole social life. All my friends go to these clubs. That's where I see them. That's my sex life basically, and meth is just a part of it. Everyone is doing it there. So while I would like to stop, it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;28;Therapist;So you recognize methamphetamine has some problems associated with it, and you also see that a lot of your social life and your sex life involves methamphetamine. It would be difficult to quit using?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;29;Client;Yeah, I don't think it would be easy, but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;30;Therapist;If you were to consider how ready you are to stop using methamphetamine completely-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;31;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;32;Therapist;-with zero being not ready at all-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;33;Client;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;34;Therapist;-and ten being ready, where would you put yourself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;35;Client;Uh, three.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;36;Therapist;Why not a one or a two?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;37;Client;This has been really uncomfortable, gonorrhea is a really bad experience. I don't think the same when I'm on it. What I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. That scares me a lot. That's why it's higher than a one or two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;38;Therapist;Are there any other concerns that you have about methamphetamine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;39;Client;Well, I do just snort it, but you don't know what it's cut with. It could be really bad if it was cut with something dangerous. I worry about that sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;40;Therapist;When I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have very little interest in stopping using methamphetamine, but it sounds like you have several reasons why you really would like to stop. That it might be cut with something else, you could get another STD, including HIV.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;41;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;42;Therapist;What do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using methamphetamine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;43;Client;Something else to do on weekends, you know, different social life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;44;Therapist;How could you get a different social life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;45;Client;It's the hard thing. Almost everybody I know uses it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;46;Therapist;Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;47;Client;My sister.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;48;Therapist;Have you talked to her about your meth use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;49;Client;I haven't talked to her about it. I think she knows I do it sometimes. We're pretty close. I think I could talk to her about it, and I think she would probably help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;50;Therapist;On the one hand, it would be difficult to quit using methamphetamine because there are so many positives that you get from using it. But on the other, there are reasons why you want to quit using methamphetamine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;51;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;52;Therapist;There are some things that you might be able to do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine, including talking to your sister and getting some support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;53;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;54;Therapist;Great. I recommend that you not use methamphetamine at all, but what you do is up to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;55;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;56;Therapist;I could see you again in a month. Would that work out for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;high;reducing drug use;57;Client;Yeah, sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;0;Therapist;Welcome, Ricky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;1;Client;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;2;Therapist;Nice to meet you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;3;Client;Yeah, you too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;4;Therapist;And you found us okay?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;5;Client;Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;6;Therapist;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;7;Client;Yeah. Yeah. pretty straightforward-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;8;Therapist;Yeah;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;9;Client;always good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;10;Therapist;Have you been here before?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;11;Client;No. No, not at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;12;Therapist;Mm. Okay. Alright. Well, um, I know a little about why you're here today-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;13;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;14;Therapist;-um, but it's great to see you, and so maybe a good point to start with is, tell me why you're here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;15;Client;"Sure. Um, I guess, you know, maybe two or three weeks ago, I had sort of like this group of friends come around to my place, and um, you know, they-they were sort of saying that it was just like a night to hang out and watch DVDs and stuff, and then they sort of sat me down and were like, ""You know, maybe you need to get a bit of help for, you know, drug stuff."" Then, you know, I was sort of like, ""Well, mm."" And I was quite annoyed by that at first, but I-I suppose, you know, I thought about it for a bit and then I was like, ""Well, I guess it can't hurt to talk to someone about it, maybe.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;16;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;17;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;18;Therapist;And that's led you to being here today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;19;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;20;Therapist;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;21;Client;Yeah. I just sort of did a bit of search on the internet and stuff and just read about this place, so I just thought I'll-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;22;Therapist;Right. So it sounds like you thought there was something that, uh, that you needed to look at, something that was concerning you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;23;Client;Yeah, I guess. I-I suppose I hadn't really thought about it till they sat me down, and you know- I mean I could, uh, I could understand a little bit of where they were coming from, so yeah, I thought I'd-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;24;Therapist;They were concerned for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;25;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;26;Therapist;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;27;Client;Yeah. Yeah, which kind of was a bit of a sh-shock, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;28;Therapist;You were surprised?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;29;Client;"Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, you know, I don't know. You know, you see on movies when people sort of intervene or say, ""You know, you need to go and get help."" And then-- I don't know. Like you know those characters and, they-they do need help, you know-";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;30;Therapist;Yep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;31;Client;-because they're fucked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;32;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;33;Client;"And you kind of go, ""Woah. That's not me."" So it's about am I-";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;34;Therapist;You're not sure that applies to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;35;Client;Yeah, or well, not to that extent, you know what I mean? Like, I-I would-- l didn't think I was at anywhere near a point that I would need to be sat down and intervened with-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;36;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;37;Client;if you know What I mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;38;Therapist;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;39;Client;I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;40;Therapist;I'm trying to understand you so far, something's concerning you and something's concerning your friends-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;41;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;42;Therapist;-but you're not sure whether it's- whether-- just how bad it is or- and you're just wanting to check that out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;43;Client;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, I mean, you know, they are my friends and-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;44;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;45;Client;- you know, I'm not gonna be so narrow-minded as to say for sure that, you know, they're entirely wrong 'cause there's a big group of them, you know? And they do care, so obviously, there's something there that I might have overlooked. But on the other ha-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;46;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;47;Client;-and just check it up, yep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;48;Therapist;Because they care about you and-and you respect what they say, and you're wondering whether something about what they're saying may be right, but let's check that out a bit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;49;Client;Yeah, pretty right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;50;Therapist;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;51;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;52;Therapist;Well, let's do some checking out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;53;Client;Okay, cool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;54;Therapist;So tell me a little bit about what you're doing, what is- what is the concern that they are raising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;55;Client;Um, dr-drugs, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;56;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;57;Client;Mm, yeah. Sort of kind of do a bit of P now and again-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;58;Therapist;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;59;Client;-and, um, I guess less often, I do a bit of, you know, I smoke a little bit and, um, party pills in the- in the weekend sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;60;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;61;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;62;Therapist;Tell me a little bit about what now and again means, and-and-and how often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;63;Client;Um, a couple of times a week maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;64;Therapist;Is this- is this with, uh, with the drug?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;65;Client;Yeah, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;66;Therapist;This is meth you're talking about? A couple of times a week?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;67;Client;Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. So I guess when I put it that way, it does sound quite a lot, but it doesn't feel a lot, you know? If you know what I mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;68;Therapist;Well, maybe, we c-- we can check that out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-- But maybe also importantly to-to discuss with you what the effects are and-and-and what your concerns are about it. But help me to understand a little bit more of what it's like for you. Tell me- tell me what are the things about your, uh, use of meth that you- that you've liked that you found good for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;69;Client;Right. Um, I suppose it's kind of hand-in-hand with just hanging out with, sort of, some new scene that I've-- Like, um, I moved to Auckland maybe three years ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;70;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;71;Client;And, um, I still live in Palmy and, so as you can imagine, it's sort of a bit different down there. And, um, kind of just when I first got here I was sorta introduced a little bit to, um, like do you know Family Bar on-on [unintelligible 00:06:49]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;72;Therapist;I know Family Bar, yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;73;Client;"Yeah. It's that sort of- that sorta scene, that kind of, um, gay scene, I guess. And, like, it's not something I'd really thought about before and-- But then kinda hung out there and just met these people that were sort of like you don't really get there much Palmy. Well, I mean I suppose you do, but they're not-- You know, in Auckland bars like that you can just-- Uh, you can just be it out in the open, you know, and I suppose in Palmy you can't as easily. Um, so just to arrive and see that and kind of meet these people that were just really friendly, you know, and-and not judge me into it. I don't know. You know, Palmy often is they're sort of like, ""Oh, you've gotta own a car, and soap it up, and drive up and down the Main Street,"" and I just couldn't give a shit about that, you know, so. Or play rugby and, you know, that didn't interest me at all and sorta come here and have people, you know, talk about interesting stuff and have a good time. I just want to go out and dance and stuff like that. Um, that was quite cool for me to know that that existed because I hadn't seen that before and-and I suppose there's a lot of that that goes on there, you know?";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;74;Client;"It's quite a heavy party scene most weekends and stuff. So it kind of goes hand in hand with that really, and just, you know, I guess when I have-have a slight-- I don't know, you just feel really good, I guess. Just feel, like, happy, and excited, and just to be surrounded by people that, you know, really care about you, and love you and-- Coming from a place where y-you didn't-- don't get that as much, it's just really cool, you know, to-to be able to go, ""Okay, on this day I can take this."" And it's just that instant, like, ""I know- I know I'll feel good."" I guess that's part of it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;75;Therapist;So Auckland, coming to Auckland from Palmerston for you was-was like taking charge of something that you were going to look to make something different in your life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;76;Client;Yeah, in-in a way. Although I wouldn't have been conscious of that really. I just sort of discovered it here. It's not like I came to Auckland looking for that kinda-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;77;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;78;Client;-lift to get away from, um, you know parents mainly, and that kind of lifestyle, that Palmy sort of lifestyle. But then yeah, I discovered this other thing, um-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;79;Therapist;Which you weren't aware of in Palmerston?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;80;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;81;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;82;Client;No. I didn't really know. I guess you see sort of things like that in-in movies from America you know, but you don't really-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;83;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;84;Client;- think that it would exist in your own country. Well, not if you grew up in Palmy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;85;Therapist;Palmerston. Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;86;Client;Um, I don't mean to be mean about Palmy but, you know, it's just the different kinda attitude, I guess, kinda- this done-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;87;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;88;Client;to that sort of thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;89;Therapist;It sounds like you're ready to move up to something that was different.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;90;Client;Yes-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;91;Therapist;And-and you came-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;92;Client;-plus-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;93;Therapist;here to Auckland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;94;Client;Yeah, yeah. I definitely wanted to get away from something. I didn't know what too, but then I arrived here and found this thing that was like actually, this was obviously, fate or whatever was pulling me to this thing-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;95;Therapist;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;96;Client;-'cause-'cause like I found something in myself or something that was missing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;97;Therapist;And how does that feel for you now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;98;Client;"Um, now, I guess, now, I'm just a little used to it. [clears throat] When I first got here, I was like, ""Wow, this is amazing."" This is hard, I guess, but, you know, it's been three years now, so it's just kinda like I've gotten used to it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;99;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;100;Client;"I mean, I guess, I'm, let's say I take it for granted but, um, yes, it's just comfortable now. And, um, it's just a sort of what I do really. Yeah, so, I guess that the drugs are linked to that, I suppose. It's j-- Well, it's just a part of it, I don't really think-- I didn't really differentiate it. It's just kinda, ""Okay, I'm gonna go hang with my friends,"" and that sort of thing, you know, that Saturday, Friday night thing. And then it just happens really as part of that.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;101;Therapist;So coming out, feeling-- being gay-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;102;Client;Yep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;103;Therapist;-being part of a gay culture here in Auckland, is feeling good-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;104;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;105;Therapist;for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;106;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;107;Therapist;And at the same time, it's-it's linked closely with the- with the drug scene with the meth scene for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;108;Client;Yep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;109;Therapist;And you're not experiencing where these two things are separate? They just seem to be together more often than not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;110;Client;Well, I guess, now, that I think about it, maybe it's sort of gone beyond that, maybe I didn't notice that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;111;Therapist;So-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;112;Client;I mean like I always-- Well, it's, you know it's kind of a thing that happens in the weekends but, I guess, sometimes in the weekdays. You know, I'll-I'll pretty much every weekend I'll have a big night, um, maybe two but sometimes, you know, in the weekdays like on a Tuesday or Wednesday or something if I just kinda feel like doing something then I might do that sometimes to see if someone else wants to come round and join me or, you know, occasionally by myself I might have a smoke by myself or something like that. And I guess that isn't entirely linked to that scene, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;113;Therapist;It just sounds like something's worrying you about that there's-there's a part link there but there's not a link and that-that maybe that the drugs is-is becoming a more important part in your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;114;Client;Mm. Maybe. I suppose I hadn't really thought about it-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;115;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;116;Client;until recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;117;Therapist;So something's changed recently?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;118;Client;Yeah. I suppose just since that kind of intervention thing or I started to give them the benefit of the doubt. And it's-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;119;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;120;Client;-maybe noticing some things that I hadn't noticed but-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;121;Therapist;Tell me about those things you're noticing that you hadn't noticed before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;122;Client;Oh, I mean, e-even just now, you know, when you asked me how often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;123;Therapist;That surprised you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;124;Client;"Mm. S-surprised me to-to think about, you know, when there's stuff, and you don't really think about it, but then if someone asked you, you know, how often or-- and then you kind of have to quantify it, I suppose it kinda sound shocking, you know, if I- if I imagine myself sort of saying, ""I do this, you know, a few times a week."" It-it-";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;125;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;126;Client;-sounds shocking. But to me it-it's- it doesn't feel that way, you know, that's kind of where that, where it kind of doesn't sit right. I, [clears throat] that's why I kind of got a bit miffed at my friends a little bit, or I dunno, a bit defensive there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;127;Therapist;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;128;Client;felt a bit weird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;129;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;130;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;131;Therapist;So you're worried a little bit about it and you're going to find out more about it, but you're-you're not gonna take on this notion of being a headache or anything as yet-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;132;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;133;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;134;Client;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;135;Therapist;So tell me then, um, Ricky, what- what's the other side of the good things that-that using meth or doing some smoking does for you? Is there a downside to it? Are there problems that you're experiencing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;136;Client;Yep. Um. Uh, I suppose money is quite a big thing. Like, I used to have a lot more money sorta last year. I had a, quite a good job, like a, quite a regular acting job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;137;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;138;Client;Um, and it was like quite a lot of money that la-last year. So it wasn't such a problem then. And I suppose I sort of blew that money a little bit. Um, so now I don't have that acting income coming in as frequently and I'm working in a cafe like a sort of part-time and it's not bringing in as much. So now it's kinda like, and sometimes I need to borrow a bit of money or sorta need a bit of help with the rent sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;139;Therapist;Quite a lot's changed over the last year from-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;140;Client;Yeah. Yeah. A little bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;141;Therapist;It doesn't sound like it was part of the plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;142;Client;No. But you know, that's the life of an actor, I suppose, ups and downs works and not works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;143;Therapist;Sure. [chuckling] It's not a secure profession-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;144;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;145;Therapist;-and it's-it's hard-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;146;Client;It's not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;147;Therapist;-it's hard. But is-is there, I just wonder, is there a connection at all between the-the-the-the acting and the meth use in terms of the effect of the meth use on your- on your ability to get work?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;148;Client;Hmm. Could have been a couple of auditions that I didn't do so well and as I could have 'cause of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;149;Therapist;The drug may have had an effect on that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;150;Client;"Uh, maybe. Maybe it's just my general sort of state. Um,I dunno, sometimes I suppose just kind of weighs on my mind a little bit like, ""What am I doing or why am I spending my money on this?"" I mean, when it's happening, it's like, this is amazing.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;151;Therapist;Hmm. Hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;high;reducing drug use;152;Client;You know am I-- You go in- you go into places, interesting places, but you know, I could just as well have saved that money and actually gone to interesting places I suppose. But I don't know. I wonder if it- if-if it's having an effect. I-I don't know. I can't say for sure, but maybe it's not so good for the;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;0;Client;Many people have told me, um, if I quit smoking, I'm going to gain weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;1;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;2;Client;Well, food really doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;3;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;4;Client;if you quit smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;5;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;6;Client;Now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;7;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;8;Client;That means a new wardrobe, which I'd like to have, but I can't afford it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;9;Therapist;Okay. So right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;10;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;11;Therapist;It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;12;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;13;Therapist;Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;14;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;15;Therapist;I'm wondering what else might be on that list.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;16;Client;Um, withdrawal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;17;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;18;Client;They say it's awful. Um, being cranky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;19;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;20;Client;And if I do go through this, I just hope my friends understand and will support me in what I'm trying to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;21;Therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;22;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;23;Therapist;-the unpleasantness of that. Okay. What else might be on the, not so good side about smoking- about stopping?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;24;Client;Um, I think everything's on the bad side about smoking, but, um, I've just smoked so long. I-I just can't imagine-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;25;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;26;Client;not- going through life without smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;27;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;28;Client;I know I've got to stop. Uh, I'm having no health problems from cigarettes-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;29;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;30;Client;-at present, but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;31;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;32;Client;-that made me rethink-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;33;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;high;smoking cessation;34;Client;everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;0;Therapist;Hi, Mr. Stowe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;1;Client;Hey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;2;Therapist;How are you doing today? I'm Bruce Berger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;3;Client;Pleasure to meet you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;4;Therapist;I'm a case manager with your health plan. I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;5;Client;Yeah. I'm supposed to learn how to manage it. I just learned that I got diabetes, and apparently, it's pretty bad because she said my blood sugar was sky high, and then she laid all these huge consequences on things that can happen. That just sounds so disastrous, and then she told me I gotta do all this stuff. And man, I'm just sort of disappointed right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;6;Therapist;So you just saw the doctor, and you sound like you just got blindsided with how frightening this seems that you have diabetes. You say she told you a whole lot of things that can happen with your eyes and circulation and all those kinds of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;7;Client;She mentioned my legs having troubles and-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;8;Therapist;And so you're really kind of reeling right now from all of that. You sound a little bit pretty scared actually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;9;Client;Well, that's, yeah. It's not just being scared, you know. I don't want that to happen to me, but then when I, when she reels off all these things I gotta do, I'm sort of going oh, oh, you know, I'm not certain I can even get it done. So it's sort of sitting-- well, you know, I'm sitting here thinking that, oh my God, this is what's gonna happen to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;10;Therapist;So it sounds like-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;11;Client;And it is discouraging, just like discouraging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;12;Therapist;So it sounds a lot like, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control. Can't imagine doing all those things, so you almost feel like all that bad stuff's gonna happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;13;Client;Yeah. It looks like a massive task that I'm may not be able to handle. And then, yeah, all this horrible stuff happens to me. I mean, it's a bleak-looking situation and a lot worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;14;Therapist;Okay. What I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down. On the one hand, your doctor is right, you know. Your blood sugar is very high, and we do want to get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen. Uh, and there are several things that you need to do in order to get your blood sugar down. Um, you know, on the other hand, we can take this a step at a time, so it's not so overwhelming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;15;Therapist;I'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now. You know, for example, there are basically three things that need to be worked out with diabetes. Taking your medicine as prescribed. Honestly, if I was gonna work on one thing right away, given that everything seems so overwhelming, it would probably be that first, because that'll have the biggest impact. How does that sound so far?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;16;Client;Well, I don't think too much trouble in taking the medicines, especially since I understand my blood sugar is really high. and-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;17;Therapist;So that's easy to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;18;Client;Yeah, I'm pretty good at taking drugs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;19;Therapist;Yeah. 'Cause it looks like you need to just take your medicine, uh, once a day from the prescription. So that sounds doable right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;20;Client;Yeah. I think I could probably do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;21;Therapist;Okay. The other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits, you know, to eat healthier, uh, not necessarily less, but healthier. And the other thing would be getting some more physical activity. By the way, that doesn't mean going to a gym. That means things like more walking, maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or an escalator, stuff like that. Uh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;22;Client;Well, she also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar and all this. That just seemed like a lot of mumbo jumbo to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;23;Therapist;Yeah. That really is to give you feedback about how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;24;Client;Oh, okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;25;Therapist;So it helps you know that when you're taking your medicine, when you're changing your eating habits, that it's really having an impact on your blood sugar because getting your blood sugar down is going to keep you from having all of those other problems. How does all this-- where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;26;Client;Well, I like it that we can do it a step at a time. That relieves some pressure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;27;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;28;Client;And being able to talk with you and do this as we go along rather than-- I wasn't certain I could just, wham, put this huge program into effect. Uh, but doing a step at a time and I, you know, that-- getting on the medicine, I don't think that's any big problem. That I can do I am pretty sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;29;Therapist;It sounds like you're very committed to that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;high;diabetes management;30;Client;Yeah. I think I could do that. Uh, as long as there's no big-time side effects, but, uh-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Is it okay if we go over the form you had filled out? We give this out to everybody who comes in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;All right. So here, it looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last year, and you have used marijuana more often, 30 days in last year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;Something like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;Okay. When students and I talk about their substance use, the first thing I always say, I don't like to tell anyone what to do. That's not my job. Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your marijuana use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;Uh, I vape. I have a pen, but I don't smoke it though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;Okay. How often?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;Um, a few times a month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;Do you vape anything else besides marijuana?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;I did a peppermint oil once, someone shared it with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;Okay. Is it okay if I share some information with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who begin using marijuana as a teenager, later on, become addicted. So what do you think about all this information that I've shared?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;Well, I don't think it's going to hurt me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;How do you think it affects you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;Um, I don't know. It makes me relax, and it's fun to laugh with my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;Is there anything about marijuana that worries you, many things that you don't like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;Well, I don't want to get in trouble like at school.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;How could you get in trouble at school?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;Well, I can get suspended and I would get kicked off the team, the basketball team.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;So staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;So when you think about these things, are there any things you would like to change about your marijuana use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;23;Client;well, I was thinking to not use when basketball season start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;What would be the benefits of that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;25;Client;Well, I play better when I'm not high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;Marijuana affects how well you play. What would be the other benefits for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;27;Client;Well, I wouldn't get caught with using a pen, so I wouldn't get kicked off the basketball team.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;Okay. Well, it sounds like you have a goal of not using marijuana once basketball starts. How long do you think you could not use?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;29;Client;For about a month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;30;Therapist;Okay. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you're not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10 meaning you're very confident, what number would you pick?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;31;Client;Um, seven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;32;Therapist;A seven. Why do you think you picked that instead of a lower number like five?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;33;Client;Well, I'm pretty sure, um, I can stop using for a month. I want to play well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;34;Therapist;So, what steps could you take to help you stop using for a month?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;35;Client;Uh, I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;36;Therapist;How about this question? What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;37;Client;Well, if I'm stressed or unhappy, that's when I usually wanna vape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;38;Therapist;What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;39;Client;Hmm, I like to play video games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;40;Therapist;Anything else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;41;Client;I can play basketball with my friend Sarah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;42;Therapist;Playing basketball and playing video games are a way to feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;43;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;44;Therapist;Well, I'm glad to hear that you have a goal of quitting for a month and you are confident of reaching that goal. If you're willing to come back in a month or so, I would be curious to hear how your plan works out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;45;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;high;smoking cessation;46;Therapist;Well, Good luck with basketball practice. If you want anything or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm here Monday through Thursday, and it's always good to see you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hi, Andrea, thanks for coming in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Hi. Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;So, I'm here to chat with you about how things are going.  It's a chance to touch base with all students a couple of times a semester.  My role isn't to change you, but to help you explore how things are and if you'd like to make any changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Sound good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Great.  Tell me a little about yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Sure. I'm Andrea, a junior. I'm in the marching band, I play tenor sax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Yeah, I'm a bit of a band geek. [laughter]  Wind ensemble, jazz band, the whole bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;Wow, music is a big part of your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;When did you start?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;About ten years ago, actually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;That's impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Yeah, violin first, then piano, clarinet, and finally, tenor sax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;That's quite a journey!  Any other hobbies besides music?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Just hanging out with friends, going to the beach, that kind of thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;Sounds fun. Tell me about your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;I have an older brother, eight and a half years older. My parents, and a dog. [laughs];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;What kind of dog?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;A Golden Retriever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;Sweet! How's school going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Pretty good. Grades are around 3.7.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Excellent!  What are your goals after high school?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Graduate, hopefully go to an Ivy League school.  Then I'd like to become a doctor, maybe study psychology and become a psychiatrist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;Ambitious goals! That's wonderful.  What things in life are most important to you?  Things like community, family, respect, etc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Community, belonging, and respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;Tell me more about why those stand out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Community and belonging, I connect them.  Like marching band, I love being part of a team working toward a goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;That makes sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;Respect is like a core rule for me.  Respect myself and others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;So, teamwork gives you a sense of belonging and purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;Yes, purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;And respect is all-encompassing, for yourself and everyone around you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;Let's talk about your friends. What do you do together?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Movies, beach, hang out at someone's house, play board games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;Do you ever drink alcohol when you're with friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;Yeah, sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;How does alcohol fit into your social life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;Mostly at parties, to loosen things up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;So, alcohol is usually at parties?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;How often do you drink?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;Maybe two or three weekends a month, when it's not too busy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;So, about half the time. What's different about the days you drink versus when you don't?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;When we drink, it's parties, dancing, having fun. When we don't, it's more relaxed, board games, movies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;So, it depends on the activity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;Client;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;Therapist;Do you enjoy the activities differently when you're drinking versus not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;Client;They're different. Board games are relaxing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;Client;Parties are energetic, but draining afterward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;Therapist;So, pros and cons to both?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;Therapist;What do you like about drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;Client;It's fun, everyone's more relaxed, not thinking about stress. But too much is obviously bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;Therapist;What are the downsides of alcohol?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;Client;People make stupid decisions. We try to be safe, sleep over at friends' houses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;Therapist;So, you try to avoid dangerous situations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;Therapist;But still, things happen sometimes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;Client;Sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;Therapist;Tell me about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;Client;I hate it when I or a friend drinks too much and throws up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;Therapist;That's never fun. How often does that happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;Client;Happened to me once, my first time. I mixed everything, didn't know what I was doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;Client;Now, I'm more careful, but friends still do it sometimes, and I end up taking care of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;Therapist;So, it ruins the fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;Client;Yeah.  People get sloppy, doing things in public that should be private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;Therapist;You're exposed to things you'd rather not see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;Therapist;You've made some choices to limit the risks of drinking. Why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;Client;My aunt is an alcoholic. I've seen the problems, and I know drunk driving is an issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;Client;I want to be as safe as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;Therapist;It sounds like you value respect for yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;Therapist;How does drinking fit with that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;Client;Drinking is disrespecting my body. But I also respect myself by trying to be safe, limiting how much I drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;Therapist;So, you're looking for a balance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;Therapist;What have you figured out so far? Do you have a limit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;Client;I make my own drink so I know what's in it. I try to make one drink last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;Therapist;Does that usually work?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;Client;Mostly.  But sometimes people offer shots, and then I drink too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;Therapist;So, sometimes it works, sometimes you'd like to make adjustments?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;Therapist;How important is it to you to make changes to your drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;91;Client;I'd like to drink less, respect my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;92;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;93;Client;It's fun to let loose, but I don't want to damage my body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;94;Therapist;On a scale of one to ten, how important is working on this goal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;95;Client;Six or seven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;96;Therapist;Why a six or seven?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;97;Client;It's still important. I don't want to hurt my body.  I know it will affect my social life and schoolwork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;98;Therapist;You know you can't keep drinking this way and achieve your goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;99;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;100;Therapist;How confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;101;Client;Ten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;102;Therapist;Why ten?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;103;Client;Once I decide, I know I can do it. It's making the decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;104;Therapist;How might you go about doing that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;105;Client;Try to suggest activities that don't involve alcohol to my friends.  Be okay with them drinking around me if I choose not to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;106;Therapist;Plan activities without alcohol, and reduce your drinking when alcohol is involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;107;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;108;Therapist;Does that sound like a goal you want to work on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;109;Client;Yes, it's possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;110;Therapist;Would it be okay to meet in a couple of weeks to see how it's going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;111;Client;Yes, that's good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;112;Therapist;You have ambitious goals, and you're working hard to achieve them.  It sounds like you have a good plan. I'm excited to talk with you again about how it's going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;113;Client;I'd like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;114;Therapist;Great. I'll see you in a few weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;115;Client;Perfect. Thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;116;Therapist;You're welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Hi, Dr. Martin. I heard you had a question for me. What did you want to talk about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;I'm sorry, but are you the pharmacist? I just had a question about citalopram.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;Yes, I'm the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. It's an antidepressant and it comes in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about 35 hours. For side effects, there are sexual side effects, heart side effects, and stomach side effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Okay, but I just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;Oh, um, yeah, I think that should be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;Okay, thanks for that. I have an appointment to run to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
69;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;All right, thanks. Call me anytime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Hi Dr. Martin, I'm Lori, the pharmacist on duty today. I understand you have some questions about the medication citalopram. Do you have a few minutes to chat about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Yeah, I do, just a couple of minutes though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;Sure thing. What are your specific questions about citalopram?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Um, nothing specific, really. I'm just not familiar with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;Okay, I understand. Citalopram is an SSRI, which stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor. It's commonly used to treat depression.  It usually comes in 20-milligram tablets, but it's also available in 10 and 40-milligram doses.  We typically recommend patients starting this medication be monitored for symptom improvement over the next four to eight weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;Okay. What about side effects?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;That's a great question.  Like most medications, citalopram can have some side effects. Some of the more common ones include gastrointestinal issues like nausea, changes in sleep patterns, and sometimes sexual dysfunction.  If a patient experiences any of these, we can discuss options like adjusting the dose or exploring alternative medications.  It's important to remember that everyone reacts differently, and many people experience few, if any, side effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Okay.  And does it interact with phenelzine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;That's a very important question, and I want to give you accurate information. Drug interactions can be complex, and I don't have that specific interaction memorized.  Rather than giving you potentially incorrect information, I'd like to double-check a reliable drug interaction database. Would it be alright if I looked that up and got back to you later this afternoon with a definitive answer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;Oh, sure. That would be great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;Perfect. I'll make a note to follow up with you before the end of the day.  In the meantime, is there anything else I can clarify about citalopram?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;No, I think that covers it for now. Thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;You're welcome, Dr. Martin. I'll be in touch soon with that information about the interaction with phenelzine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;Thanks again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;Therapist;No problem. Have a good day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;0;Therapist;So, you've got this dream, it sounds like, which is to have a partner, a house, a nice car...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;1;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;2;Therapist;...don't forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a good dad to your kids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;3;Client;Yeah, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;4;Therapist;So, is this dream starting to...am I getting a good picture of it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;5;Client;Yeah, it would be good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;6;Therapist;Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;7;Client;I guess it doesn't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;8;Therapist;Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;9;Client;Uh, I guess I have to keep coming back here and go to court and stuff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;10;Therapist;Yeah?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;11;Client;Yeah. It kind of messes things up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;12;Therapist;Yeah. It kind of messes up that dream, that picture?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;13;Client;Yeah. It makes it harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;14;Therapist;Mm. Makes it harder? Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;15;Client;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;16;Therapist;And harder to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;17;Client;Like it's hard to get a job because you have to say that you've done prison time and stuff, so it's pretty hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;18;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;19;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;20;Therapist;And we've talked about that idea of you getting a job, something to do with cars because that's where your passion is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;21;Client;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;22;Therapist;Yeah? So, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;23;Client;Uh, I don't know if...if I would go to polytech, do courses there or something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;24;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;25;Client;Yeah. Like, if they've got jobs now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;26;Therapist;Okay, so you know some people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;28;Therapist;You've gone down that road of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;29;Client;Yeah, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;30;Therapist;...getting a qualification?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;31;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;32;Therapist;Yeah? So, what would interest you about going down that same sort of path?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;33;Client;Just learn more about cars and just kind of a hands-on job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;34;Therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;35;Client;[sighs] Mechanic, or panel beater, or just...I wouldn't care, I just...as long as it's cars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;36;Therapist;Mm-hmm. So, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be happy with that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;37;Client;Yes, pretty much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;38;Therapist;Yeah?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;39;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;40;Therapist;Okay. So, what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path, to get that qualification?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;41;Client;Just I have to get that training, I guess, and then probably get a job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;42;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;43;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;44;Therapist;Okay. So, what sort of training did you...did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;45;Client;Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. I don't know what exactly it was, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;46;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;47;Client;It took them like...and it took them like a year or something, and then they went into an apprenticeship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;48;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;49;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;50;Therapist;Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these friends that you've got?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;51;Client;Yeah. I could do it pretty easily. It's just, like, I probably know all this stuff already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;52;Therapist;Okay. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, Billy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;53;Client;Like, well, I went out and picked up some forms and stuff, but it's really confusing, like, having to apply, so I...I just couldn't...I don't know. I couldn't do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;54;Therapist;Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;55;Client;Yeah, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;56;Therapist;...and picked up some forms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;57;Client;Yeah, yeah. Passed them around and everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;58;Therapist;Wow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;59;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;60;Therapist;That's fantastic, Billy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;61;Client;Yeah, but I just...Like, they wouldn't help me out, so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;62;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;63;Client;...I got some forms and...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;64;Therapist;Tell me...tell me what happened when you say they...like it didn't help you? What...what happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;65;Client;I asked...I asked them what I had to do, and they said I had to fill out some forms, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;66;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;67;Client;...well, the forms, they're too confusing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;68;Therapist;Okay. So, they gave you a bunch of forms for a particular course?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;69;Client;Yeah, yeah. Well, I got one...I got one for panel beating, and one for, uh, like, panel and paint...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;70;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;71;Client;...so, learning how to paint cars and stuff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;72;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;73;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;74;Therapist;Okay. So, you got the forms, took them...took them home?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;75;Client;Yeah. I was going to fill them out there, but then I didn't get them, so I took them home, but I was going to get Donna to help me, but I just didn't get around to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;76;Therapist;Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;77;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;78;Therapist;Yeah? What's the confusing bit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;79;Client;I didn't understand, like, what you're supposed to write down. Like, yeah. I'm not good at this, maybe too confusing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;80;Therapist;Yeah. So, when you've had to write things or fill out forms before, how's that been for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;81;Client;I don't really deal with it. I...I don't really like writing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;82;Therapist;You don't like writing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;83;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;84;Therapist;Yeah. So, wondering what that's about, about not actually liking writing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;85;Client;No, I'm just really messy, so people can't read it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;86;Therapist;People can't read...People can't read your handwriting?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;87;Client;[chuckles] Yeah, no. It's what they say, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;88;Therapist;Oh, you must be a doctor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;89;Client;Yeah, I am. [chuckles];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;90;Therapist;Yeah? [chuckles] Yeah?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;91;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;92;Therapist;Okay. So, you need some help to fill out the forms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;93;Client;Yeah. Like, a computer or something. If you could write on a computer, I could do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;94;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;95;Client;But, we don't have a computer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;96;Therapist;Okay. All right, so what do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and send it off?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;97;Client;Just ask to get someone else to do it, I guess. I guess I could ask Donna, but it's been embarrassing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;98;Therapist;Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask Donna to give you some help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;99;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;100;Therapist;...because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;101;Client;Well, I don't know if it's that serious, it's just...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;102;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;103;Client;...I'm sure most people can fill them out. I don't know, I just don't get it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;104;Therapist;Hmm. So, who else could you ask to help you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;105;Client;No one. I guess you. You could do it. Would you do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;106;Therapist;Well, have you got the forms with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;107;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;108;Therapist;Okay. I'm wondering about...because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;109;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;110;Therapist;...and getting on this road where you're staying out of trouble because you've got this, um, interest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;111;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;high;reducing recidivism;112;Therapist;...which you can do. So, it seems a real shame that the forms are going to get in the way, so we need to find a way;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you. As you know, we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school. As athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student-athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule. I've been hearing some chatter from other kids about a party this weekend, where you were there, and I can't confirm or deny anything. So, I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences, but I did want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Right. Actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened this past weekend. Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student. I usually study over the weekend, and my parents don't let me go to parties, but I kind of used that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. When I got there, I'm not used to this party environment where everything you see in the movies is kind of what happens, where you have people just drinking out of the bottle...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;...or playing random games with alcohol, just to get drunk for no reason. Because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else was doing, so I wouldn't be ostracized.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Yeah, I get it. We've all been there. I was in high school once too, you know, I drank too. I get it. There's not a ton to do in this town, and kids drink, but we have these rules...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;I understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;...and you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Okay. I know that it's bad for me. It's bad for my body. It's bad for being on the team, for being an athlete. It hinders my performance. I just don't know. I feel that my friends pressure me. I don't know. I feel I should go with different friend groups. Maybe. I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;Yeah. Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I don't know, like being on a sports team, you feel very...you have to be unified with the group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;Yeah, but you're one of the leaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Right. As one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be...I expect them to lead not only in sports but also in social environments. It's a social custom in our society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;Yeah. Well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being, you know, too serious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;You're a star player, who's going to pick on you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;I mean, it's just one person against the group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;All right. The issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties, and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. There are rules at this school, and in my job, I have to enforce them. I get that you want to have fun in your teenage years. I get that. But you are a star player, we want to keep you on the team. We have to figure out a way to get through this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I'll dedicate the time not to party and get involved with alcohol to that extent, and have it publicized on the internet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;What do you mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Like on Facebook, all the pictures that you saw. I will avoid those situations where I feel pressured to drink alcohol and allow what I do in my private time to be put on the internet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;All right. We have to have a deal here if you're going to be on the team.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;I'll stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;You promise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;I promise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;All right. Shake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Shake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;All right. I'll see you later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;See you later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;All right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;0;Therapist;Hi Sarah, thanks for coming in today.  I know scheduling this has been tricky, so I appreciate you making the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;1;Client;No problem.  It's good to be here. I've been thinking about what we talked about last time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;2;Therapist;That's great to hear.  Remind me, what's been on your mind?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;3;Client;Well, it's the whole exercise thing.  I know I need to do more, but it just feels so overwhelming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;4;Therapist;Overwhelming, huh?  Tell me more about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;5;Client;Yeah, like, everyone says I should go to the gym, or run, or something. But I hate all that.  It feels like it's not for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;6;Therapist;So, the typical exercise recommendations don't really resonate with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;7;Client;Not at all.  I'd rather sit on the couch with a book.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;8;Therapist;I hear you.  It sounds like you're looking for something that fits your personality and lifestyle a bit better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;9;Client;Exactly!  Is that even possible?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;10;Therapist;Absolutely.  Exercise doesn't have to be a one-size-fits-all thing.  What kinds of activities do you enjoy, even if they don't seem like 'exercise'?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;11;Client;Hmm... I like being outdoors.  And I love animals.  I used to go horseback riding as a kid, but haven't done that in years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;12;Therapist;Horseback riding! That's interesting.  That's definitely a physical activity.  What else comes to mind?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;13;Client;I also like gardening.  I have a small garden, and I spend time out there most weekends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;14;Therapist;Gardening is great!  It involves a lot of movement. So, we've got horseback riding, gardening...anything else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;15;Client;I sometimes walk my neighbor's dog.  He's a little terrier, full of energy.  That's fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;16;Therapist;So, it sounds like you enjoy activities that connect you with nature and animals.  These all involve physical movement.  What do you think about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;17;Client;I guess I never thought of them as 'exercise' before.  They're just things I enjoy doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;18;Therapist;Exactly.  And that's a great starting point.  Maybe we can explore how to incorporate these things, or similar things, more regularly into your week.  No gym required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;19;Client;That sounds amazing!  I'd be much more likely to stick with something I actually enjoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;high;reducing drug use;20;Therapist;That's the key.  So, let's talk more about what might be realistic and sustainable for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;0;Therapist;Hi Deborah. How are you doing today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;1;Client;Good, I'm doing really good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;2;Therapist;Yes, so you did your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything you'd like to talk about that you discovered?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;3;Client;Yeah, I really liked doing this, and I rated health as my first value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;4;Therapist;Oh, so it's your first?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;5;Client;Yeah, because I really value physical and mental health, spiritual, emotional. Everything as a whole package, I guess, health. And I'm working on a certification to become a fitness trainer. Cal State, it's exciting, a different career path in my life. Being an office worker for so long is getting boring too-- physical activity, health, in that respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;6;Therapist;So, health being your number one, which is kind of pushing you into this new direction, as far as you being a prior office worker? You're doing something you're actually living to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;7;Client;Yeah, I like being active. You know, if I could be more adept at tennis, I would love to do something like coaching people how to play tennis, but I don't. I know enough about the game and play it, but I don't think my skill level would be high enough to actually coach other people but—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;8;Therapist;Now, have you done this sheet more than once?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;9;Client;Yes, I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;10;Therapist;And then, has health always been number one for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;11;Client;It's been in the top. It's been up there, yeah. I don't remember if it's always been number one. It's probably definitely been in the top three. Yeah, because I've had problems with inner harmony, I guess, in different stages in my life, so I don't get that. This time I put it at number two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;12;Therapist;Inner harmony is number two?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;13;Client;Yeah, it's just funny how it came out that it wasn't in the top 12. But then when I look at it again it had something to do with peace, inner peace or something or something in there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;14;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;15;Client;And I put that as a higher priority, or top of my value list.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;16;Therapist;So, would you like to express more on the inner harmony part of how that affects your life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;17;Client;Yeah. Since I've been practicing yoga, and since I learned how to teach yoga, that's been something that I've been coming to terms with more, that I feel like I have a lot more inner harmony. I'm more at peace with myself, and in the quiet times, and if I'm meditating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;18;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;19;Client;I really feel like-- yeah, I feel really good about myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;20;Therapist;So, yoga, is that based on the number two, like inner harmony? That's where that comes from?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;21;Client;Yeah, that's part of it. Yeah, and then just feeling like I don't have to please other people either. It's not a selfish thing to put myself first. And that's something I've always tried to do, make other people happy, please other people, and also put myself second, third, fourth, or whatever it is. And I always thought, 'Well, that's the way a good person should be. They should always put other people first, you know. And then there's times for that, you know. There's something going on, and you wanna go out of your way to help people, and you say, 'Well, my needs aren't so important right now.' I think that is okay to do once in a while. As long as you know you're not really doing anything detrimental to yourself while you're doing it. And you realize, 'Well, I'm just-- I'm really helping this other person a lot, and it gives me satisfaction.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;22;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;23;Client;Not out of a sense of, you know, 'I'm obligated to this person.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;24;Therapist;Yes, yes, yes. So, basically, reflecting on how you felt before about you were coming second, third, and fourth. It was really a problem, you know, like, how could you be so, you know, selfish, and think about yourself when—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;25;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;26;Therapist;—the reality is inner peace and inner harmony is based around, you know, self-worth, and you know, self—and dealing with—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;27;Client;Self love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;28;Therapist;Self love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;29;Client;Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah. And that it's not selfish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;30;Therapist;Yeah that's not selfish. And so you feel as though you can help, you can be of help to others, just as long as it's not detrimental to yourself. It's true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;31;Client;Yes. Yeah. Um, then, and but also service, that's third because I really do enjoy helping other people. Being there for other people, you know, and if it puts myself out. Like I have my brother, his daughter, and his granddaughter they come over and I slept on the air mattress, and me with my mother and my dad and my sister—my—his daughter in the other spare room that I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;32;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;33;Client;And I do that, but I think, well, it's one night or it's two nights that I have a guest. I could sleep in my bed all the other days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;34;Client;So, you know, even if it's a little inconvenient for me, or my house gets messy, or my kitchen is a mess, or whatever they don't pick up after themselves it's okay. You know, I'll live. You know, it's okay, it's not a big deal. Yeah. Before it was wisdom, because I really, that's—it is high on my list and it might be higher if these other things weren't here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;35;Client;But I like I enjoy learning and experiencing different cultures going to different places in the world and then just also being around people that live in the community that are from other cultures. And I think that brings a lot of wisdom. And just also being open to differences. And then like today, Election Day realizing that something might happen in the Congress or the Senate, that's gonna be sort of against my values but if it happens, it happens, and I have to deal with it and be at peace with myself with about whatever anybody else is doing I still have to have that inner peace within myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;36;Therapist;And in the sense of you saying in your words, you'll live.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;37;Client;Right. Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;38;Therapist;So, live, having that as a priority, um, do you feel as though, like you said before you'll live, but you know that you're able to look at, okay, these are my values, you know, and you're able to acknowledge values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;39;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;40;Therapist;And learning the differences of the different cultures that brings you wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;41;Client;Yes. And school learning in the classroom and outside of the classroom. Where I've been in different Native American communities, reservations, place I spent two months in the summertime really learning about the cultures is a beautiful place to be, there's a lot of wisdom. And fun, pleasure, fun, satisfaction—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;42;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;43;Client;—enjoyment. I think it's intertwined in a lot of things. It's fun to learn about other people, other cultures. it's fun to have the inner harmony. I think that—I think that was an all-encompassing thing about life. The part of it is to experience pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;44;Therapist;So pleasure being your number five.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;45;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;46;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;47;Client;And when I think of the flip side of that, I know there's gonna be pain, disappointment, upset in my life, too that I accept that and that's part of joy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;48;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;49;Client;True joy comes from knowing it's not always gonna be happy. I'm gonna—I'm gonna be bummed out sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;50;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;51;Client;I'm gonna be disappointed, I'm gonna be injured or whatever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;52;Therapist;So you've taken that into account that—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;53;Client;Absolutely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;54;Therapist;—things may happen in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;55;Client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;56;Therapist;It sounds as though your list is like definitely a story. It kind of attracts you in the beginning as far as your health and the number two was being service. Number three.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;57;Client;Inner harmony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;58;Therapist;Inner harmony was number two, and having that peace of then to allow yourself to help other people or to serve—service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;59;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;high;unidentifiable;60;Therapist;Not being, you know, whatever you did for others. That being, um, as far as, like you said within yourself, that you won't be able to find problems with helping other people. And;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;0;Therapist;Hi. Are you Julie Thompson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;1;Client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;2;Therapist;Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I work in the clinic, and I noticed you're here to pick up a prescription for Sarah's rescue inhaler for her asthma. I also noticed she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. What's that been like for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;3;Client;It's been really difficult. I hate to see her gasping for breath, and I'm really worried when she has to go. It's really difficult when I have to take her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;4;Therapist;It sounds like you'd do anything to prevent that from happening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;5;Client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;6;Therapist;I also noticed it's been about three months since you picked up the prescription for her regular inhaler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;7;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;8;Therapist;Are you having some difficulties with that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;9;Client;Well, I researched the regular inhaler and found it contains steroids. I don't want her taking steroids. I researched the potential side effects and health problems that can result from taking steroids, and I just don't want her exposed to them at all. Also, I smoke, but I make sure I don't smoke around her so it doesn't affect her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;10;Therapist;It sounds like you care about Sarah a great deal. You don't want her using steroids, you're worried about the effects, and you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;11;Client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;12;Therapist;Would you mind if we talked about the regular inhaler and the medicine you're concerned about, the steroids? I certainly don't want her using medicine with the kind of steroids you're worried about for athletes. Can we talk about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;13;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;14;Therapist;The medicine in this inhaler is in the same broad family as the steroids you're worried about, called anabolic steroids, which build people up and have masculinizing effects.  If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same fruit family. A grape is much smaller than a watermelon. Eating one grape is fine, but eating a whole watermelon can make you sick. The medicine your daughter takes is like the grape. It's in the same family, but the amount of drug is very small. It's not an anabolic steroid. This drug reduces inflammation in her lungs and isn't absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. I wouldn't want your daughter taking medication like anabolic steroids. This is really safe for her. What are your thoughts about her using this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;15;Client;I guess I didn't realize they weren't the same as anabolic steroids, the ones that cause all the problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;16;Therapist;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;17;Client;If you can assure me it won't have those same side effects and health problems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;18;Therapist;Definitely not. You probably saw 'corticosteroid' and thought 'uh-oh'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;19;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;20;Therapist;That concerns people. But this medication only goes to her lungs and won't get in her body. They're not the same as the drugs you're worried about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;21;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;22;Therapist;Do you mind if I talk about what her lungs are like when she has these inflammations and needs the emergency room?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;23;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;24;Therapist;When someone has asthma, their lungs are hypersensitive. If you had the skin burned off your arm, someone brushing against you wouldn't bother you before, but with burned skin, you'd react. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. This regular inhaler reduces the inflammation so her lungs aren't so sensitive. Otherwise, everything in the air, like dust and pollen, reacts with her in ways it wouldn't normally affect us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;25;Client;Oh, okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;26;Therapist;This regular inhaler can prevent that, which is why it's so important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;27;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;28;Therapist;Even though you're smoking outside and keeping smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes can also affect her lungs and cause a reaction because her lungs are so sensitive. If she uses the regular inhaler every day, she might not be as sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still might be because her lungs are different. Honestly, I'd love to see you quit smoking for you too, because it's not good for you, and it would certainly help her. But keep an eye on what happens when she uses the regular inhaler. If she's still flaring up when you're around, it could be the smoke on your clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;29;Client;Oh, even when it's just on my clothes? She's that sensitive? I didn't realize that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;30;Therapist;It might not when she uses the regular inhaler, but you'll need to keep an eye on it. It would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;31;Client;Right. The thought of quitting is daunting. I know people who've tried, and it's really difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;32;Therapist;Very hard. It's relaxing, and it's hard to replace it with something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;33;Client;Yeah, it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;34;Therapist;What could you do to help at this point, if you don't quit right away?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;35;Client;I was thinking, since it affects her that it's on my clothes, if I only smoked while she was at school and then changed my clothes before she came home. Would that help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;36;Therapist;That sounds great if you could do that. Obviously, don't smoke in the house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;37;Client;Oh, absolutely. Never.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;38;Therapist;If you're willing to do that, it would help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;39;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;40;Therapist;If you decide to quit someday, we'd be glad to help. It's not easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;41;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;42;Therapist;It sounds like you're willing to have her use the regular inhaler to reduce inflammation so she doesn't need the emergency room, and do what you can to keep smoke off your clothes. I think you'll see big changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;43;Client;Oh, really?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;44;Therapist;Yeah, because you'll get that inflammation down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;45;Client;Oh, that's great, because it's always scary when she has to use that one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;46;Therapist;We'll get both prescriptions ready. Use the regular inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around, and let's see how that works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;47;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;48;Therapist;Okay?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;49;Client;That sounds good. Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;high;asthma management;50;Therapist;All right. Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;0;Client;Something clicked. I'd had a few drinks, and I knew I'd messed up. I totally messed up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;1;Therapist;Can you tell me more about what made you realize you'd messed up?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;2;Client;I was right there, in the same place where I'd come home and taken those pills. It was the same situation, and I wanted to stay there. I felt like I'd ruined everything. Erin called me the next day, and it was great, but I felt ashamed, and I don't want to feel that way again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;3;Therapist;It sounds like you felt you put something really important to you at risk. Is that what you mean when you say you felt guilty talking to Erin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;4;Client;Yeah, I think so. I could have gotten completely drunk and continued every night for the rest of the week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;5;Therapist;So, you recognized you were risking something valuable to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;6;Client;I don't know if I stopped because I knew I had to, or because I just wanted to stay in that state. Anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;7;Therapist;It's been three months now, and things have been going well. You've even been able to see your kids again, which was a major goal for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;8;Client;Things are definitely better, yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;9;Therapist;Yes. And then this incident happened. It sounds like it went from a red light to a cautionary yellow light, now that you can see your kids again, something you've been working towards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;high;managing life;10;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Jean, it's good to see you again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Hello, doctor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;So, what's been happening since our last session a week ago?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;Well, I did what we discussed. I kept the journal for a week, trying to track my smoking, being more aware of the urges, and if I could resist them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;I found it was manageable. It got a little tricky on the weekend because the urges kept coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;Sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;Especially when I was out with friends or at home with more free time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;I understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;But during the week, I was able to cut back at least two or three cigarettes a day, and that's just in one week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;That's excellent progress, Jean. Cutting back by two or three cigarettes in just one week is a real accomplishment, especially considering how much you were smoking before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;So, you were able to consistently use the journal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;It sounds like that helped you focus on the timing and delaying your cigarettes. That's great.  What were some of the challenges you faced, or things that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hoped?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;It just seemed to get harder on the weekend when I was socializing and had more downtime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;Right. So, it sounds like those automatic cigarettes, the ones you have when you're socializing or have more free time, are the biggest challenges you're facing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;And you diligently recorded all of this in your journal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;Yes, I made a point of being completely honest in my tracking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;That's important. It shows real commitment. So, you've already started thinking about what you might do differently on weekends, like finding a hobby or joining a group?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;Yes.  I'm thinking if I can just postpone it, tell myself I won't have it at home, I'll wait until I'm at work or on my way to work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;That sounds like a good strategy. So, between now and our next meeting, what specifically would you like to focus on?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;23;Client;I think I'd like to continue with what I did this first week. I found the journaling helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;Okay, so you'll continue with the journaling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;25;Client;Yes. And since I managed to cut back a couple of cigarettes a day this week, I'd like to try and reduce it further, maybe down to five cigarettes a day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;Five cigarettes a day sounds like a reasonable goal. What are some concrete steps you could take to make that happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;27;Client;I can try to keep a daily count.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;29;Client;And I'll continue to try and resist the urges, postpone them, and maybe not go out for a cigarette until the next urge comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;30;Therapist;That sounds like a solid plan. It's great that you're finding strategies that work for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;31;Client;Talking to you really helps too, having someone to discuss this with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;32;Therapist;I'm glad I can be of assistance.  Given your goals and the progress you've made, when would be a good time for us to meet again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;33;Client;I'd like to come back in a week. This is all new, and a week feels manageable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;34;Therapist;Absolutely. Okay. We'll see you in a week then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;35;Client;Yes, thank you, doctor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;high;smoking cessation;36;Therapist;You're welcome, Jean.  See you next week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;It sounds like you've been experiencing some significant changes recently.  Can you tell me a bit more about what's been happening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Okay. I guess I've been getting bigger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;That sounds like a big shift.  Can you tell me more about what that's been like for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Uh, scary I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;So, if I'm understanding correctly, you're feeling a bit uneasy about these changes in your body?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;Yeah. I-I know there's something in there, I just don't know much about him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;It sounds like you're curious but also maybe a little apprehensive about what's happening. Is that fair?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;I understand you mentioned seeing a doctor.  You haven't made the call yet, is that right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;Yes. It seems overwhelming to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;Overwhelming in what way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;Well, I hate making phone calls, and I know I need to fill out all this paperwork. I don't know how to get there, and I hate needles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;So it sounds like a few things are contributing to this feeling of being overwhelmed: the phone call itself, the paperwork, transportation, and also your discomfort with medical procedures involving needles. Is that a good summary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;Therapist;It's completely understandable to feel that way.  It takes courage to face these kinds of challenges.  Let's break this down a bit. Which of these feels like the biggest hurdle right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;Client;Probably the phone call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;Therapist;Okay.  Would you be open to exploring some ways we could make that phone call feel a little less daunting?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;Client;Maybe.  I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;Therapist;No pressure at all.  Just thinking out loud here, we could practice the call together, or maybe even look up the number and have it ready so it's one less thing to worry about. What do you think about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;19;Client;That might help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;20;Therapist;Great. We can also brainstorm some ideas about transportation and how to manage the paperwork later.  And regarding the needles, we can discuss some strategies for coping with that anxiety as well. How does that sound?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;21;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;22;Therapist;So, it seems like you're taking a step towards addressing this.  What feels like the next small step you'd be willing to take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;23;Client;Maybe looking up the number.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;24;Therapist;That sounds like a great first step.  Would you like to do that now, or would you prefer to think about it a bit more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;25;Client;Maybe now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;high;adhering to medical procedure;26;Therapist;Okay, let's do it together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Interlocutor;Utterance_text;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Therapist;Welcome. It's good to connect with you today.  We're going to talk about your alcohol use and contraception.  Is that okay with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Client;Yes, that's fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Therapist;Great.  To help us understand where you're at, we'll use a scale of 1 to 10. One means 'not at all important' or 'not at all confident,' and ten means 'extremely important' or 'extremely confident.'  First, how important is it to you right now to reduce your drinking to lower-risk levels?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Client;I'd say about an eight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Therapist;An eight. That shows it's definitely a priority for you. Now, on that same scale, how confident are you right now that you can actually achieve that goal of drinking at lower-risk levels?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Client;Probably a four.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Therapist;A four. Okay. So, it's quite important to you, but your confidence is a bit lower. That's perfectly understandable.  What are some things that give you *any* confidence at all, even if it's just a little bit, that you could make these changes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Client;Well, I know I have a family history of alcoholism, and I really want to avoid that. That's a big motivator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Therapist;That's a very powerful reason.  It sounds like you're aware of the potential risks and are motivated to protect your health. What else contributes to your confidence, even at a four?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Client;I have a group of friends who don't drink much, and when I'm with them, it's much easier for me to not drink as much either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Therapist;That's fantastic.  Having supportive friends can make a huge difference. So, you have this awareness of the risks and a supportive social network. Anything else that comes to mind?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Client;Not really, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Therapist;That's perfectly fine. Now, let's shift gears a bit and talk about contraception.  How important is it to you to use effective contraception consistently every time you have sex to prevent pregnancy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Client;Also an eight, I'd say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Therapist;Another eight.  So, preventing pregnancy is clearly important to you as well.  And how confident are you that you can use effective contraception consistently and correctly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Client;Probably a six.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Therapist;A six.  So, a bit more confident than with the drinking, but still room for improvement.  What contributes to your confidence level here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Client;I think if I drink less, I'll be more responsible with my birth control.  When I've had too much to drink, I'm less likely to use it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Therapist;That's a really insightful connection.  It sounds like you recognize that your alcohol use might be impacting your ability to use contraception effectively.  So, addressing your drinking could potentially have a positive ripple effect on other areas of your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Client;Yeah, I think so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Therapist;It sounds like you're already doing a lot of the work here by recognizing the connection. So, given all of this, would you be open to exploring some strategies to help you reduce your alcohol consumption?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Client;Yes, I think that would be helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Therapist;Great. We can work together to develop a plan that fits your lifestyle and goals. We can also explore any additional information you might need. How does that sound?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Client;That sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Therapist;Excellent. Let's start by…[continue with plan development];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Hello, Rick. Welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Kia ora.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;Good to see you here. I see on your file that you're, uh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Yup. That's right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;What part of the... are you from?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;I'm from down south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;Oh, okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;Right down the bottom? Down Bluff?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;Yes sir. I'm from Invercargill just short of Bluff. All my family is still down there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;Oh, are they? So you were born down there and-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;raised down there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;Mm-hmm. Country boy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;Therapist;Country boy. Been up in Christchurch how long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;Client;I've been up here since I was 18.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;Therapist;Oh, so you've been here a while?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;Client;Just a little while. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;Therapist;Oh good. You got family out here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;19;Client;Uh, just my own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;20;Therapist;Just your own family here. Well, Rick, I'm sort of, uh, interested in that, you know, you and I are gonna be doing some work together for a while. I'm sort of wondering what sort of thoughts you'd be having on your way here today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;21;Client;Um, I was thinking about what you might ask me, what I would say. I'm thinking about my kids, thinking about having to take a day off work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;22;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;23;Client;It's a bit of a pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;24;Therapist;Okay. I see you've had some experience with, uh, coming to prevention services before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;25;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;26;Therapist;What's that been like for you in the past?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;27;Client;Uh, it's been okay. Um, it hasn't been bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;28;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;29;Client;I don't know. Kind of nothing, really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;30;Therapist;Okay.  Sounds like maybe not as helpful as you'd hoped.  Similar sort of situation this time that's brought you back?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;31;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;32;Therapist;One of the things I've noticed, Rick, is that a lot of guys don't even make it through the door. You're here. What does that tell you about you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;33;Client;Um, I hope that it says that I want to, um, make some changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;34;Therapist;Yeah.  Wanting to make changes is a big step.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;35;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;36;Therapist;Is that different from how you felt when you came in before?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;37;Client;Yeah.  I mean, I still had to walk through those doors, so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;38;Therapist;Yeah.  It takes courage.  And what's driving that desire to change now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;39;Client;I just think about my kids, you know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;40;Therapist;Yeah. They're really important to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;41;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;42;Therapist;Yeah. And do you have your kids with you full-time or-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;43;Client;No. No, I don't. I see them, um, once a fortnight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;44;Therapist;Okay. And what's that like for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;45;Client;It sucks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;46;Therapist;Mm-hmm.  I can imagine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;47;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;48;Therapist;What would you really like to happen in terms of, uh, you and your children?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;49;Client;I just-- I'd love to be able to see them whenever I can, whenever I wanted to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;50;Therapist;Yeah.  To have that flexibility and connection with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;51;Client;Yeah. You know. They're my whole world and I've messed things up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;52;Therapist;Right.  It sounds like you're really aware of the impact this has had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;53;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;54;Therapist;So, thinking about coming to see me, doing this work together, and then going on to do a program, how important is that gonna be for you and your children?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;55;Client;It's really important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;56;Therapist;Mm-hmm.  On a scale of 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being absolutely crucial, where would you say this is for you right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;57;Client;It's, uh, um, it's hard because--because I'm, uh, I'm not a bad person. I've just done some stupid things, but I'm not a bad person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;58;Therapist;Right. You see yourself as someone who's made mistakes, not as a bad person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;59;Client;Yeah. In regards to my kids, I'd be 100 - 100%.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;60;Therapist;Right.  Absolutely vital when it comes to your kids.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;61;Client;If it means I can see my kids whenever I want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;62;Therapist;Yeah.  So, imagine your kids were here now, hearing you say this is 100% for them. What do you think they'd be feeling?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;63;Client;Um, I-I-I'd hope that they'd be proud of me. I wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see me here though. But I- But I hope they would be proud of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;64;Therapist;Okay.  You'd hope they'd see you're making this effort for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;65;Client;'Cause I'm-- Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;66;Therapist;Good.  Is there anyone else in your family who would be really proud of you taking these steps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;67;Client;Um, oh, my mom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;68;Therapist;Yeah.  Is your mum still down south?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;69;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;70;Therapist;Yeah. Does she know that you're here today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;71;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;72;Therapist;So, how do you think she'd feel if she knew you were having this conversation today, that you're serious about making some changes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;73;Client;Yeah, I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;74;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;75;Client;I just, um, I don't- don't know where to start. I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;76;Therapist;It sounds like starting the program feels like a good first step.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;77;Client;Yeah, I hope so. I-- So I genuinely want to, I genuinely want to do something to help myself. I don't deliberately mess things up for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;78;Therapist;Yeah.  It sounds like you're ready to make a real effort this time.  We're going to be working together on this, and sometimes it can get tough.  A lot of guys, when things get difficult, they drop out.  What do you think about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;79;Client;No, this is important to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;80;Therapist;Right.  You're committed to seeing this through.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;81;Client;I have, um, I've-- it's important to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;82;Therapist;Good.  Now, one of the things that can really help is having support.  Who else in your life could you be accountable to while you're doing this program?  Think about your children, your mom, anyone else you interact with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;83;Client;I, um, I'm separated at the moment from my partner, and-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;84;Therapist;What was her name?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;85;Client;Uh, Kirsty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;86;Therapist;Kirsty.  Would you like her to know you're doing this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;87;Client;I would love for her to know that I'm doing this and for her to know that I mean it, but, um, I know she wouldn't care right now actually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;88;Therapist;Right.  It sounds like things are difficult there at the moment. What about your employer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;89;Client;Uh, yeah, I don't know. Maybe, but I don't know if I want them to know though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;90;Therapist;Okay.  That's something we can explore later.  Any other family close by?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;91;Client;I'm pretty much by myself up here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;92;Therapist;Okay.  So, it sounds like you're feeling a bit isolated here. Your family is down south.  Who else could be a support for you on this journey?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;93;Client;Um, I don't know. I don't, um, have that many people-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;high;adhering to medical procedure;94;Therapist;Okay.  Rick, it sounds like you've got a lot on your mind, and you're really motivated to make some changes for yourself and your kids. We've talked about your goals, the importance of this for you, and the challenges you might face, including finding support. For our next session, I'd like you to think more about who could be part of your support network.  Even one or two people can make a big difference.  How does;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;0;Client;I just feel helpless about this whole deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;1;Therapist;It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;2;Client;Mm. I just feel helpless about this whole deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;3;Therapist;It's understandable to feel that way when facing challenges.  Can you tell me more about what's making you feel helpless?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;4;Client;No one wants to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;5;Therapist;That sounds incredibly isolating. It must be difficult to feel like you're facing this alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;6;Client;No one wants to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;7;Therapist;It seems like you're really longing for support right now. Is there anyone specific you were hoping would help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;8;Client;Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;9;Therapist;It sounds like you're regretting a decision you made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;10;Client;Mm-hmm. I really shouldn't have done it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;11;Therapist;It's common to have regrets. What's making you feel this way about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;12;Client;Mm-hmm. I couldn't help myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;13;Therapist;It sounds like you felt powerless in that situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;14;Client;I couldn't help myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;15;Therapist;It takes courage to admit that.  Can you tell me more about what happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;16;Client;It's actually been a fabulous week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;17;Therapist;That's wonderful to hear! It sounds like things have been going well for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;18;Client;It's actually been a fabulous week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;19;Therapist;What's contributed to making this such a positive week?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;20;Client;Mm-hmm. I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;21;Therapist;It sounds like you're confident in your ability to make good choices about who you spend time with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;22;Client;I know who to hang out with, I'm not stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;23;Therapist;It's great that you recognize the importance of positive influences in your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;24;Client;Mm-hmm. I'm letting the whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;25;Therapist;It sounds like you're feeling a sense of disappointment and responsibility towards your family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;26;Client;Mm-hmm. I'm letting my whole family down. They had such high hopes for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;27;Therapist;It's clear how much you care about your family and their expectations.  What makes you feel like you're letting them down?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;28;Client;Mm-hmm. This is not what I want for my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;29;Therapist;It sounds like you have a clear vision of what you *do* want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;30;Client;This is not what I want for my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;31;Therapist;That's a powerful realization.  What steps could you take to move closer to that vision?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;32;Client;Mm-hmm. I really want to get off the program.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;33;Therapist;It sounds like you're eager to make some changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;34;Client;I really want to get off the program.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;35;Therapist;What makes you feel like leaving the program is the right step for you right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;36;Client;Mm-hmm. I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;37;Therapist;It sounds like you're still experiencing some challenges with cravings, even though you've quit smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;38;Client;I still crave smoking, even though I've stopped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;high;reducing drug use;39;Therapist;That's a common experience.  It takes a lot of strength to resist those urges.  What's helping you to stay strong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;So, thanks for coming in today. We're going to talk for a bit about the questionnaires you filled out, but before we dive into those, is there anything in particular you'd like to discuss or any specific concerns you have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Um, yeah, I mean, when I was doing those questionnaires, it was weird because, I guess I don't really think about the drinking being this huge deal and I don't ever really think about how much I drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;It sounds like completing the questionnaires brought to light some things you hadn't really considered before about your drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Yeah, like, filling out how much I'm drinking every day, it was like, 'Wow,' you know, like, I just didn't ever really think about it like that I was-- like, if I try to actually count the drinks, it's kind of a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;So, actually tracking your drinks gave you a clearer picture of your consumption, and it was a bit of a surprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Well, yeah, 'cause, like, I also kind of thought that I drink about as much as my friends did and then, like, I went back and I was talking to my roommate about it and I was telling her that, you know, I was drinking, like, ten drinks on the weekends, including Thursday, so like, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;And your roommate was surprised by that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Yeah, and she was like, 'That's crazy. Why are you drinking this much?' And I was like, 'Well, you know, like, different places.' And I guess my friends didn't really know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;It sounds like you realized your drinking habits were different from what you assumed and that even your roommate was taken aback by the amount you were consuming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Yeah, and I guess it was just like, I thought that everybody was doing it, but that's not really what was going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;So, the realization that your drinking patterns are different from your friends' and that it might be more than you thought is what stood out most from completing the forms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Yeah, so, that was the thing that was really the most weird about doing those forms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;Okay. So, it sounds like this information about your drinking has been a bit of a wake-up call. We can talk more about what you'd like to do with this new understanding. What are your thoughts about it now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I don't know. I guess I'm a little concerned, but also, I don't know, it's just kind of what I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;That's understandable. It's not always easy to think about changing habits, especially ones that are part of your social life. We can explore those feelings and any concerns you have. What would you like to focus on as we talk today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Maybe just understanding why I drink so much, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;That sounds like a good place to start. We can definitely explore that. Perhaps we can begin by looking at some of the patterns you noticed in the questionnaires. Would that be alright with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Yeah, that's fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;0;Therapist;Okay, so, um, in this program, we encourage everyone to choose at least three goals they'd like to work on over the next 30 days. We'll be checking in with you to see how you're progressing.  It's important to pick goals that are meaningful to you and that you feel ready to work towards. With that in mind, is there anything you'd like to change or focus on, either at home or at school?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;1;Client;Um, I need to start getting to school on time for my first class. I always miss it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;2;Therapist;Okay, so getting to school on time for your first class is something you'd like to work on over the next 30 days?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;3;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;4;Therapist;That's a great goal.  Why is it important for you to achieve this goal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;5;Client;Uh, so people will stop bothering me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;6;Therapist;And who are these people?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;7;Client;My mom. She's always telling me to get to school. And my probation officer says if I don't get to school on time, I could face sanctions, and I really don't want that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;8;Therapist;So, avoiding those sanctions is a strong motivator for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;9;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;10;Therapist;Okay. So, getting to school on time for your first class is your goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;11;Client;I'll try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;12;Therapist;What specific steps would you need to take to get to school on time for that first class?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;13;Client;I can never seem to get up in the morning. That's the hard part. And by the time I do get up, get ready, and get dressed, I miss the bus. So, I usually end up walking or trying to find a ride. There are a lot of reasons why I'm late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;14;Therapist;Okay, so it's not just one single thing that's causing the problem?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;15;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;16;Therapist;Knowing that a few different things can get in your way, what do you think would be the most helpful for you to get to school on time? What do you know you need to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;17;Client;Getting up on time would probably be a good start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;18;Therapist;What time would you need to get up?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;19;Client;[sighs] If I'm going to catch the bus, I'd probably need to be up by 6:15. But that's so hard, because I go to bed so late. I don't know if I can do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;20;Therapist;So, you're a little unsure if you can do it, but you also mentioned that you really want to do it to avoid those sanctions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;21;Client;Right. I could try...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;22;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;23;Client;...and see how it goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;24;Therapist;So, you're willing to give it a try?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;25;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;26;Therapist;What time would you need to go to bed at night to make sure you're up by 6:15?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;27;Client;I usually go to bed around midnight now, so if I tried maybe 11:00. I could try 11:00.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;28;Therapist;Okay, so you're willing to try going to bed at 11:00 and setting your alarm for 6:15 the next morning?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;29;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;30;Therapist;When would be a good day for you to start this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;31;Client;Uh, tomorrow or the next day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;32;Therapist;Okay, so should I write down tomorrow or the next day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;33;Client;Let's start tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;34;Therapist;Tomorrow it is. Great. Who could help you get to bed on time and make sure you're up by 6:15?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;35;Client;My mom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;36;Therapist;Your mom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;37;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;38;Therapist;Is there anything your mom could do to help you with that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;39;Client;[sighs] She could, after my alarm goes off, if I don't get up, she could come in and wake me up and remind me that I told you I was going to get up, so I have to do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;40;Therapist;So, it's almost like you want your mom to remind you that this is something you want for yourself.  Not just because she's telling you to get up, but to remind you, 'Hey, remember, this is something you want – to be on time for your first class.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;41;Client;Exactly. Yup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;42;Therapist;Great. What could potentially get in the way of you not getting up by 6:15?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;43;Client;[sighs] Not going to bed on time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;44;Therapist;Not going to bed on time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;45;Client;Yup, that's going to be a struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;46;Therapist;Okay. So, if you're feeling tempted to stay up later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;47;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;48;Therapist;...how could you respond instead?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;49;Client;Just go to bed and turn off the lights, and not have my phone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;50;Therapist;Okay, so your phone is a distraction.  So, keeping your phone away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;51;Client;Oh, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;52;Therapist;...and actually turning the lights off and making sure it's dark?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;53;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;54;Therapist;Kind of a reminder that it's time to go to bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;55;Client;Have my mom check on me to make sure everything's put away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;56;Therapist;And also having the support of your mom too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;57;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;58;Therapist;Great. So, how will you know that your plan is working?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;59;Client;When I'm at school on time, when the bell rings and I'm in class.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;60;Therapist;So, for you, being in your class when that bell rings, that's how you'll know you've achieved your goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;61;Client;Absolutely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;62;Therapist;So, what I've been hearing so far – and this is a great goal – is that you've already had some insights into how to do this. It's really important for you to get to your first class because you don't want to face those sanctions. You don't want to have all those extra people checking up on you. You've already made a plan to go to bed by 11:00, turn off the lights, and put your cell phone away.  Having your mom's support will also be really helpful. You're going to try getting up at 6:15 in the morning when the alarm goes off.  I know that seems really early, but you seem willing to do it. And if you have trouble, your mom will be there to help you out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;63;Client;Well, yeah, I hope so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;64;Therapist;That sounds like a great plan, and you said you're going to start tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;65;Client;I'll give it a try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;66;Therapist;Great. Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;high;compliance with rules;67;Client;You're welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Tommy, I wanted to talk because I saw some pictures on Facebook of you and friends at a party.  I'm concerned. You're a good kid, and I'm worried about the drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;It was just a social gathering. I wasn't looking for it. The drinks were there, and all my friends were doing it. It's not something I do often, but when the opportunity comes up, it's nice to let loose and have fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;I understand, but drinking has consequences. You're not 21 yet. You could get arrested, have an accident, or mess up school. You have a bright future, and this concerns me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;I get what you're saying. I thought I had it under control and didn't drink too much. I wanted to make sure my friends were okay, so I didn't overdo it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;There's no such thing as not drinking too much when you're underage. Think of what could happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Yeah, I understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;How much are you drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;I don't think I drink that much. It's mainly at social gatherings. I don't do it alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;Is it every weekend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Every other weekend, I'd say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;Tommy, I'm concerned. Can't you think of better things to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I guess I could be more productive with schoolwork instead of going to parties. I understand where you're coming from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;Are your friends the problem? Maybe you should hang out with different people, like kids in your youth group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I guess I haven't really thought about it.  It seems like my friends are doing it, and I'm just following along because it looks fun. I want to have a good high school experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Lots of things seem fun in the moment but aren't good choices. We've talked about making good choices.  I think you should consider making a change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;I see that drinking less could improve my life. It makes sense. I can try to lower how much I drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;I think you should quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Alcohol is everywhere. It's hard to avoid at parties. I feel like I should understand its effects before cutting it out completely. I don't think it will ruin my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;I disagree. It worries me.  Cutting down is better than nothing, but I'll keep talking to you about this. It's important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;I don't see the problem right now. Maybe it's because I haven't had a bad experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Do you want to wait for that? Do you want something bad to happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;No. I don't want to go too far down that road. I can imagine things happening where I can't escape. I haven't had alcohol affect me or anyone close to me much, so I feel in control, but maybe I'm not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;Maybe we can work on this together. We can make a plan for you to get control and stop drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;That would be a good step towards being sober and experiencing life without alcohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Okay, sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Hi Jean, I'm Dr. Selby. It's good to finally meet you in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Hi Dr. Selby.  It's good to meet you too. I appreciate you making time for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;Of course, Jean.  So, tell me what brings you in today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;Well, it's...it's the smoking.  I've known for a while I need to quit, and my recent COPD diagnosis really brought it home.  It's scary, and honestly, I'm not sure I can do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;That sounds like a lot to process, Jean.  A new diagnosis like that can be really unsettling. It’s understandable that you’re feeling scared.  It takes courage to face something like this, and it sounds like you're ready to take some steps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;Yeah, I know I need to.  I just...I've tried so many times before. Pills, patches, even therapy. Nothing seems to stick.  I feel like a failure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;It sounds like you've been through a lot, Jean.  Those experiences must be frustrating. It's important to remember that setbacks are a normal part of the process, and they don't mean you're a failure.  What makes this time feel different?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;Honestly?  The diagnosis.  It's not just some abstract health risk anymore.  I can feel it.  I cough all the time, even when I'm just talking to clients on the phone. It's embarrassing, and it's frightening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;That makes complete sense.  It sounds like the COPD diagnosis has really brought the reality of the situation into sharp focus.  So, if you could wave a magic wand and have things be different, what would your ideal situation look like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;I'd love to just...not crave them anymore.  To not have it be such a constant battle in my head.  And to be able to breathe without worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;That sounds wonderful.  Imagine that for a moment – what would it be like to go through a day without that constant craving, without the coughing fits?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;It would be...freeing.  I’d have more energy, I wouldn't feel so ashamed. I could actually enjoy things again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;That sense of freedom is something many people who quit smoking experience. It sounds like it's really important to you. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being 'not at all important' and 10 being 'extremely important,' how important is it for you to quit smoking right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;Definitely a 10.  It has to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;And on that same scale, with 1 being 'not at all confident' and 10 being 'extremely confident,' how confident are you that you can actually make this change?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;Probably a 3 or a 4.  Like I said, I've tried so many times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;That's completely understandable given your past experiences.  What would it take to move that 3 or 4 up to a 5 or a 6?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;I guess...some real support.  Someone to help me figure out what works this time. Maybe a group or something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;It sounds like connection and support would make a big difference for you.  We can definitely explore some options for that.  In the meantime, how would you feel about keeping a smoking journal for the next week? Just noting down each cigarette you smoke, when you smoked it, and what you were doing at the time. Sometimes, just becoming more aware of our habits can be a powerful first step.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;Yeah, I guess I could do that.  It might help me see how much I actually smoke, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;Exactly. It's not about judging yourself, Jean. It's simply about gathering information. We can then use that information to work together and find strategies that fit your life. How does that sound?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;Okay. That sounds good. I appreciate you listening, Dr. Selby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;high;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;You're very welcome, Jean. I'm glad you came in. We'll work on this together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;0;Therapist;So, we have several areas we could explore. You mentioned wanting to increase your physical activity, improve your eating habits, and boost your body confidence.  What feels most pressing for us to focus on today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;1;Client;I think physical activity seems like the most manageable starting point.  Changing my nutrition feels more challenging right now, but if I can establish an exercise routine, it might make those other changes easier down the line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;2;Therapist;Okay, so physical activity feels like the best initial focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;3;Client;Yes, I think so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;4;Therapist;Great. Tell me more about what motivates you to become more physically active. You've mentioned wanting more energy and a better mood, feeling less irritable and stressed. Are there any other benefits that are especially important to you right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;5;Client;Yes, I'd like to feel physically stronger and more capable.  Like, the other night I struggled to open a jar of salsa.  So, things like that, in addition to the mood and energy boost, would be a definite goal. And I think if I'm more active, my body image and confidence will improve too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;6;Therapist;So, you want to feel stronger, capable of doing things like opening jars, and also have increased confidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;7;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;8;Therapist;On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being 'not at all ready' and ten being 'I'm excited and ready to go,' where do you see yourself regarding physical activity?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;9;Client;I'd say about an eight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;10;Therapist;Okay, so you're feeling quite motivated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;11;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;12;Therapist;Why not a six?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;13;Client;Well, I've identified so many positive outcomes from being more active. I really want that improved mood and energy, and to feel better about myself.  Those things are driving my rating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;14;Therapist;You're recognizing numerous benefits to physical activity, including increased energy, better mood, greater strength, and improved body confidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;15;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;16;Therapist;Have I missed anything?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;17;Client;I don't think so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;18;Therapist;Okay, those are the key motivators for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;19;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;20;Therapist;Fantastic.  Now we can start exploring what that might look like for you, and what kinds of activities you might enjoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;21;Client;That would be great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;high;managing life;22;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;Therapist;Okay, so, um, we're here today to talk about whatever you'd like to talk about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;Client;Um, how about we talk about the problem I'm having, which is getting someone motivated to move out of my house?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;Therapist;Okay, so you're trying to... Tell me a little more about it so I understand better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;Client;Well, I offered my home to someone for a transitional period.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;Client;And it seems hard for me to be assertive and say the transitional period is over and it's time to move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;Therapist;So, it was a kind thing to do to take someone in when they needed help. But now you're thinking the time is up, and you're ready for them to move out and have your place back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;Client;Yes, that's right. I want change, but I'm not good at saying those words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;Therapist;And what would help you get to the point of asking them to leave?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;Client;Um. [sighs] I don't know. I guess I care about the person, and there's a certain comfort in having someone there. So, I'm at war with myself because part of me wants the companionship, and the other part... I'm just not sure what I want to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;Therapist;So you feel two ways about it. You feel the time is up, but there's also security in having them there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;Client;Yeah, it's like that old song, 'Hit the Road Jack,' but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;Therapist;But you're not quite ready to sing that song.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;Client;[laughs] Well, he'd probably leave if I started singing that song because I can sing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;Therapist;I thought you did a pretty good job singing just now. I appreciate your sense of humor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;Client;Well, you have to have a sense of humor in life, otherwise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;Therapist;It really helps you get through things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;Client;Yeah, I have to laugh. Even comedians say they're not always happy and they use comedy to deal with life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;Therapist;Your new career.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;Client;Yeah, like my friend Ruth who has a serious job but does comedy on the side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;Therapist;So, what would be the benefits of them moving out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;Client;Mm. Let's see. I'm not really sure. I'm having a hard time with that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;Therapist;Tell me more about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;Client;Well, I have to really think about it because...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;Therapist;Some guilt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;Client;Yeah, maybe some guilt, and I just... [sighs] I go back and forth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;Therapist;Because you want to do the right thing, and that's important to you – helping people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;Client;Yeah, I... thank you. I appreciate you saying that. I feel I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;Therapist;But you've done your duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;Client;Yeah. It's just hard to... my job is done, and I have to be more assertive and sure of myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;Therapist;So, what have you done to start the process?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;Client;Well, I've had conversations, some not so pleasant. I tend to hold things in, and then finally, I was very logical about it. The other day, I wasn't so logical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;Client;[laughs];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;Therapist;You mentioned talking to others, and he has some options for other places to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;Client;Yes. That's good. I mentioned them to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;Client;That gives me relief, like I'm not just saying 'go find your own place.' There are places he can go, and that makes it easier to discuss, giving him options.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;Therapist;So, you might have to literally pack his bags and help him get to those places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;41;Client;Been there, done that. [laughs];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;Therapist;Okay. You've done this before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;43;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;44;Therapist;So, when are you going to do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;Client;Well, I told him within a couple of days. I have future plans, and things are up in the air for me too. I've been here seven years, but I'm not sure what's next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;46;Therapist;Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;47;Client;Um.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;48;Therapist;And it's kind of scary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;49;Client;Oh, God, yeah. And it's scary to have an extra burden to carry with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;50;Therapist;And he's that extra burden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;51;Client;Yeah, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;52;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;53;Client;But it's not that I don't care about him. It's just, we're all adults here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;54;Therapist;Okay. So, it sounds like you've worked it out for him to be out within a couple of days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;55;Client;That's the goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;56;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;57;Client;And I don't know his plans, but those are my plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;58;Therapist;Okay. Well, I have a feeling your plans will prevail. [laughter];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;59;Client;I like your way of thinking. I'll tell him that. [laughs];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;60;Therapist;Well, thanks for talking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;61;Client;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;Therapist;Hi, Ruth, thank you for coming today. How are you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;Client;Um, okay. I don't even know why I'm doing this anymore. I'm just so stupid. I'm such an idiot. I don't know what the point of this is. I just keep doing the same thing over and over, even though I know it can hurt me. I just don't have any more willpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;Therapist;Ruth, it sounds like you're very frustrated. You're saying you're tired and have lost all your willpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;Therapist;You don't want to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;Client;No, it just seems like hurting myself is the only way out. I get suicidal thoughts. I'm very depressed with what's going on at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;Therapist;So you feel really overwhelmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;Therapist;You're tired, you're stressed, and you feel so sad that you're hurting yourself physically to feel something other than what you're feeling right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;Client;Yes. Sometimes the physical pain is easier to handle than the pain inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;Therapist;So you're in a lot of pain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;Client;Yes, I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;Therapist;I'm sorry about that. It must be very frustrating to feel all that pain and not be able to do anything about it. It seems like the only thing you can do right now is to cry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;Client;Yeah, and think about suicide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;Therapist;It's okay, Ruth. I understand the pain inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;Therapist;So your mom doesn't understand you, and you don't have a dad around?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;Client;Yeah, she's a single mom and struggles a lot. I want to help her, but I can't. It makes me sad. I feel like if I weren't alive, she'd be okay, and she wouldn't have to worry about me or my expenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;Therapist;So you feel like your hands are tied, that you're a burden to your mom. She's a single parent, she works a lot, and you have all these problems in your life. It sounds like you feel you're adding to her burdens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;Therapist;And you think if you weren't alive, that would solve the problem for her. She'd be better off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;Client;I think so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;Therapist;How would she be better off without you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;Client;Because it wouldn't be a burden to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;Therapist;And how are you a burden now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;Client;Because she has to pay for my food, my uniforms, and our housing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;Therapist;How do you help her now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;Client;I try to be a good kid. I try to go to school. My grades aren't the best, but I'm not failing anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;Therapist;Okay. Even by coming here today, Ruth, and talking to me, opening up and telling me you don't want to continue, confiding in me that you hurt yourself and feel all this pain, that's you trying to help yourself. It shows you care. It shows you care about your mom, and you're worried about the burdens on her, even thinking of removing yourself to make her life easier. That shows me how much you care about her. But the solution you have in mind seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;Client;The right one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;Therapist;How could it be the right one? Ending your life, hurting yourself, when it's just you and your mom? You just said she's a single parent, she doesn't have a husband, you don't have a dad. It's just the two of you. How could that be the right choice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;Client;Um, I don't know. I'm not sure I can...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;Therapist;You're not sure. You have a lot on your mind right now. You've opened up to me, told me you've been hurting yourself, thinking about killing yourself, not wanting to be here. Short-term, it helps you. You feel like a burden to your mom, that stresses you out, makes you sad. You see how much she struggles. But we also see how much you've been trying to help by going to school. We know your attendance is good, you're trying to keep up your grades. You have a C average, even having an A in math, which was your lowest grade. All of that shows how much effort you've put in, and we see that effort. You've been doing what you can, and it's normal to feel like it's not enough sometimes. That's what we're here for, so you can tell us these things, and we can help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;Client;Thank you, I feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;Therapist;Thank you, Ruth, for coming today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Thank you for coming in today, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you.  Could you start by sharing a little about yourself and what brings you in today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Uh, yeah, sure. Um, well, my doctor referred me to see you. Um, he has some concerns about my pregnancy and my baby. So, I'm doing what I'm told.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;So you're following through by meeting with me today, and you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you tell me a little more about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Uh, yeah, he is concerned about my alcohol intake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Okay. And I'm wondering if you have any concerns about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Uh, no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;No. Okay. So that's not an issue for you. It is an issue for him, but not for you at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;Okay.  Could you share a little about your alcohol intake and what your life is like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Um, okay. Uh, well, I guess I drink a glass of wine at supper every night, and sometimes a bit more to relax with my friends if I go out. Wine has always been a kind of family tradition with supper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;So it's part of your culture, and you find alcohol helps you relax a little.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;"Yeah, and I have friends who drank during pregnancy, and I see articles on Facebook that say there isn't really a clear link between abnormalities and alcohol. I just think it's kind of an old wives' tale. I'm independent and I'm going to do what I want; it's my body.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Okay. So you're not comfortable with someone telling you what kind of alcohol and how much you should consume. It sounds like you've been getting mixed messages. Your doctor says there's no safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy and asked you to see me. You've also been looking into this yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Yeah. I've looked it up to support my argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Yeah, which is that I'm going to do what I want. So... I'm here anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;You know yourself best and want to be in control of your body.  You don't want someone else telling you what's okay.  It seems you're not too concerned right now about your alcohol use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Nope. Never have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Okay. Is that lack of concern based on your past experiences, the messages from friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Yep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;And the information you've seen in the media that suggests it's okay to drink alcohol?  So, you're not concerned, and maybe the doctor is exaggerating?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Mm-hmm. I think so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;You think he might be overreacting a bit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;To suggest quitting drinking entirely?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;I'm wondering, would you be open to looking at what the current guidelines say about drinking?  Would that be something you'd consider?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Like right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;Uh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;What if I showed you a brochure about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;Uh, yeah, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;Yeah?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;Sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;If we look at the low-risk alcohol drinking guidelines, it says the safe limit for women is 10 drinks a week, and no more than 2 drinks a day.  This applies to women who are not pregnant. The guidelines also state there is no safe amount of alcohol to drink during pregnancy. Zero alcohol is recommended. What are your thoughts on that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Well, I've heard these things before, but I don't see the evidence. I don't see the risk.  If someone could prove it to me, or show a direct link...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;So, seeing it in writing isn't enough to convince you it might be dangerous to drink during pregnancy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;It's the same thing I've already heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;So you feel like what the doctor and this brochure are saying is a bit blown out of proportion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;And it sounds like you've found information suggesting alcohol is safe during pregnancy. Tell me about that information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;Um, well, I've looked up different articles.  And, as I said, I know people who haven't had any problems. That's about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;Mm-hmm. You mentioned articles, and evidence is important to you. Are these recent articles?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;I don't have a bibliography or anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;So I don't know when they were published. Just stuff I found supporting my view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;So the information you found supports your desire to be independent and autonomous, to make your own choices. The information from your doctor and this brochure seems to challenge those values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;Client;Yeah. This brochure just says the same thing I've heard, about the limits and no safe amount during pregnancy. But why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;Client;What kind of issues would it cause, if any?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;Therapist;Maybe we can set that aside for a moment and come back to it later. We'll look at what the guidelines say about the 'why.' Could we talk about your pregnancy? Was this a planned pregnancy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;Therapist;Something you were hoping for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;Client;Yep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;Therapist;Okay. How important is it to you to have a healthy baby and be a good parent?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;Client;Um, it's really important. It's a big priority to have a healthy baby and raise him or her well, and be a good parent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;Therapist;Mm. What does being a good parent look like to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;Client;Um, being there at home with them, not being absent, taking care of them, feeding them, changing their diaper (which I'm not excited about). The basics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;Therapist;Hmm. Protecting your baby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;Therapist;...guiding your baby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;Therapist;...nurturing that baby is really important to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;Client;Yeah, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;Therapist;...and raising your baby well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;Therapist;That really matters to you. I hear you saying protecting your baby is important, but that seems to clash with the information in the brochure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;Therapist;What do you think about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;Client;Um, I don't know where these brochures get their information, where's the hard evidence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;Therapist;You want to see it in black and white.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;Therapist;You want to know it's current and reliable. The information I've shared is based on the latest research since 2011. There's been a lot of research on what's safe for a pregnant woman to consume, including alcohol. This is the evidence we have. Ultimately, you choose what's best for you and your baby. What are your thoughts?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;Client;It surprises me that it's based on research from 2011. I must have missed that. If it is current, I want to do what's best for my baby and myself. If I have to quit drinking, I guess I'll make that decision.  But it's a lot to take in today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;Therapist;Mm-hmm. It sounds like you've been making good decisions about your baby. You've done research, you want to raise your baby well. I can see that's important to you. This information wasn't what you were expecting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;Client;Nope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;Therapist;What would be helpful next steps, as you think about potentially reducing or stopping alcohol use during your pregnancy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;Client;Um, if I could take a brochure home to show my partner and get their support. That would really help me. And changing our habits, putting the alcohol away. That's probably the best thing I can do today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;Therapist;Mm-hmm. Those are significant steps. Putting the alcohol away is huge. That's really big.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;Therapist;Thank you for exploring this with me today. Could we continue this conversation and talk about those steps, how it goes with talking to your partner about reducing or stopping drinking, and give you a chance to do more research and review the brochures? Would that work for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;Client;Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. Maybe you could help me with ways to approach it with my partner, because I think they have the same view I had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;Therapist;We can definitely cover that next time. Thank you for coming in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;Client;Yeah. Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Therapist;Hi Mr. Smith, thanks for coming in.  Let's start by checking in on how your medication is working for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;Good, I think it's helping.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;That's great to hear. I also wanted to discuss your blood pressure, which was a little elevated last time.  Is now a good time to talk about that, or would you prefer to address it at a later appointment?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;Well, I'm a bit rushed today, to be honest.  I had a long wait, and I've got a busy afternoon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;"I understand completely.  My apologies for the wait; that's certainly not ideal.  It sounds like your time is valuable.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;It is.  I'm self-employed, so time off means lost income.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;Absolutely.  I appreciate you making the effort to come in.  So, regarding your blood pressure, we can certainly focus on that today.  Would you be open to briefly discussing some lifestyle factors that can contribute to blood pressure, even if we can't go into great depth today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;Okay, a quick chat is fine.  But I really do need to get back to the office soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;Understood.  So, how do you generally feel about your current lifestyle and its impact on your health?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;Well, I know I could probably eat better and exercise more.  It's just… time.  I'm constantly working.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;That's a common challenge. Many people find it difficult to balance work and healthy habits. It sounds like you're aware of what you could be doing differently, but the practicalities of fitting it into your schedule are the real hurdle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;Exactly.  Ready meals and grabbing food on the go are my staples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;So, if things were different, if you had more flexibility in your day, it sounds like you'd be more inclined to make healthier choices?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;Definitely.  I know what I *should* be doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;Okay.  So, it sounds like you're motivated to make changes, but the current structure of your work life makes it difficult.  Is that a fair summary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Client;Yes, that's it in a nutshell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;16;Therapist;Thanks for sharing that. Given your time constraints today, how about we schedule a follow-up appointment specifically to explore some strategies for incorporating healthier habits into your busy schedule? We can brainstorm some realistic and manageable steps you could take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;17;Client;That sounds good.  But please, no more long waits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;18;Therapist;Absolutely.  I'll make sure to schedule you for the first appointment of the day to avoid any delays.  We can use that session to really dive into this and find some solutions that work for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;19;Client;Okay, great.  I'll check my schedule and call to book something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;20;Therapist;Perfect.  And in the meantime, perhaps just give some thought to any small changes you might be able to make, even if they seem minor.  We can discuss those at our next meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;21;Client;Will do. Thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;high;diet and weight loss management;22;Therapist;You're welcome.  I look forward to our next conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;0;Therapist;Hi, Mike. I'm Kathy. I appreciate you coming in today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;1;Client;Hi, Kathy, nice to meet you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;2;Therapist;I understand you'd probably rather be elsewhere, but thank you for being here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;3;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;4;Therapist;I want to check in on how you're doing physically.  Your safety is important, so I'd like to ask a couple of questions about that, if that's alright?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;5;Client;Sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;6;Therapist;I understand you're here because of a speeding ticket. Is that right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;7;Client;Actually, I got a DUI and was speeding at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;8;Therapist;Oh, I see.  Are you feeling unwell or sick at all right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;9;Client;No, I'm fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;10;Therapist;Good. I just wanted to make sure. When was the last time you had a drink?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;11;Client;The night of the DUI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;12;Therapist;Okay.  I understand your lawyer suggested this assessment. Can you tell me what you understand about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;13;Client;He said I should come here and tell the truth, but I'm not really sure what it means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;14;Therapist;I appreciate your honesty.  Do you have any questions for me about the process?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;15;Client;No, not really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;16;Therapist;Your lawyer mentioned your blood alcohol level was 0.28.  That's significantly above the legal limit for driving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;17;Client;Is that bad?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;18;Therapist;Yes, it's considered very high.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;19;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;20;Therapist;The officer at the scene seemed concerned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;21;Client;Yeah, he was freaking out a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;22;Therapist;I understand.  I'd like to ask some questions about your drinking habits. You said the DUI was two weeks ago. What did you drink that night, and how much?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;23;Client;I was at a friend's birthday party downtown. It's not typical for me, but I drank too much and made a bad decision to drive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;24;Therapist;Can you tell me more about how much you drank?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;25;Client;I don't really remember. Maybe five or six drinks, I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;26;Therapist;Five or six drinks. What kind of drinks were they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;27;Client;Vodka and soda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;28;Therapist;You mentioned this isn't typical for you. How often do you usually drink?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;29;Client;Normally, one or two drinks, and not very often. There's no real pattern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;30;Therapist;So, you wouldn't consider yourself an alcoholic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;31;Client;No, it was just poor judgment that night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;32;Therapist;So, drinking doesn't usually interfere with your daily life?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;33;Client;No, not at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;34;Therapist;When do you think you started drinking regularly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;35;Client;I don't really drink regularly, so I'm not sure that question applies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;36;Therapist;Okay.  Let's talk about your first DUI.  This was your second, correct?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;37;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;38;Therapist;It seems like the times you've had more than a couple of drinks, you've gotten into trouble. Is that a fair assessment?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;39;Client;Yeah, pretty much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;40;Therapist;It sounds like you've had some bad luck.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;41;Client;Yeah, it seems that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;42;Therapist;"Does alcohol always seem to be involved when you have these bad luck"" incidents?""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;43;Client;It seems like it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;44;Therapist;Can you think of other times when alcohol was involved and things went badly, or was it just these two DUIs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;45;Client;I don't usually drink to excess.  It's not a regular thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;46;Therapist;Where do you typically drink? At home, socially after work, or at events?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;47;Client;Usually socially.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;48;Therapist;Have you thought about ways to ensure your safety after drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;49;Client;Yeah, maybe calling a taxi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;50;Therapist;That sounds like a good idea. It seems like you've already been considering your options.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;51;Client;Yeah, or I could just stay home if I plan to drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;52;Therapist;That's a responsible approach. You've clearly given this some thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;53;Client;Yeah, I don't like getting into trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;54;Therapist;No one does. When you think about alternatives to driving after drinking, how consistent is that thought? Do you think you'll act on it next time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;55;Client;I'll never drive drunk again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;56;Therapist;What makes this time different?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;57;Client;I don't want to lose my license or my job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;58;Therapist;You need your license for work, since you sell cars, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;59;Client;Yes, exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;60;Therapist;You're here today, and I commend you for that.  It shows you're taking this seriously.  Calling a taxi or staying home are good signs you're thinking about safety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;61;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;62;Therapist;What does staying home look like for you? You mentioned drinking at events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;63;Client;The Super Bowl is coming up. I might drink then, so I'll probably just have people over instead of going out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;64;Therapist;That sounds like a good plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;65;Client;Yeah, it's safer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;66;Therapist;Have you ever considered not drinking at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;67;Client;After my first DUI, I didn't drink for six months. I didn't think I had a problem, so I started again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;68;Therapist;Six months is a significant period. What were those six months like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;69;Client;It was strange. My friends didn't hang out with me as much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;70;Therapist;Your friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;71;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;72;Therapist;The ones you usually drink with?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;73;Client;Yeah, my social circle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;74;Therapist;Why do you think they didn't spend as much time with you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;75;Client;Probably because I wasn't drinking with them. I don't really know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;76;Therapist;Did you talk to them about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;77;Client;No, my girlfriend at the time didn't want me to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;78;Therapist;So, your girlfriend was important to you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;79;Client;Yes, at the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;80;Therapist;Why did you break up?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;81;Client;She left when I started drinking again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;82;Therapist;After the six months?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;83;Client;Around the same time. We were arguing a lot. I didn't feel like myself. I missed going out with my friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;84;Therapist;You felt isolated?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;85;Client;Yeah. I felt like she was trying to control me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;86;Therapist;So, you value your independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;87;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;88;Therapist;How long ago was that six-month period of sobriety?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;89;Client;My first DUI was three years ago, and this one was a few weeks ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;90;Therapist;What have been the positive and negative aspects of drinking since then?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;91;Client;I don't really think of it in terms of good or bad. I just drink socially.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;92;Therapist;Did those friends start spending time with you again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;93;Client;Yes, after my girlfriend and I broke up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;94;Therapist;So, your girlfriend and your friends didn't get along?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;95;Client;She blamed my first DUI on them, saying they encouraged me to drink too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;96;Therapist;What do you think about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;97;Client;I think she was right. If they hadn't given me those shots, I would have been okay to drive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;98;Therapist;So, you think you would have been fine if they hadn't given you those shots?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;99;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;100;Therapist;You mentioned hitting a mailbox. Was that related to the first DUI?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;101;Client;Yes, I hit a mailbox a couple of blocks from home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;102;Therapist;That must have been frightening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;103;Client;I don't remember much of that night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;104;Therapist;Was it a blackout?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;105;Client;I don't know if it was a blackout, I just don't remember it clearly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;106;Therapist;After that incident, you stopped drinking for six months, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;107;Client;Yes, and we were trying to work things out, but it didn't last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;108;Therapist;You felt like she was controlling you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;109;Client;Yes, I was tired of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;110;Therapist;You felt like you needed your friends, too?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;111;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;112;Therapist;You mentioned your friends gave you shots. Did you feel pressured by them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;113;Client;No, they just shouldn't have given me those last shots. They knew I'd had enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;114;Therapist;They weren't looking out for your best interests?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;115;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;116;Therapist;And you drove after that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;117;Client;Yeah, it was my choice to take the shots, but I don't remember much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;118;Therapist;It's easy to have 20/20 hindsight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;119;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;120;Therapist;So, after you started drinking again, did you reconnect with the same group of friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;high;compliance with rules;121;Client;Yes, they've been my friends;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Steve, before we finish today, would you be open to discussing your drinking habits?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Okay, what about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;You completed a survey for us, which was very helpful. Thank you. I'd like to review a few things. I noticed you indicated drinking two to three times a week, three or four drinks per occasion, and sometimes consuming six or more drinks in a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Yes, on weekends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;I'm a little concerned about your drinking level. Excessive drinking can worsen existing problems or cause new health issues. Have you considered the connection between your drinking and the anxiety and insomnia you mentioned?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;No, not really. I don't think I drink that much, so I doubt it's causing my anxiety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;It's common to think drinking aids sleep, but it can have a rebound effect. While it might help you fall asleep faster, it can lead to waking up in the middle of the night or early morning and struggling to go back to sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;I do wake up around 2:00 AM on nights I drink heavily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;This chart shows that for your age and gender, your drinking exceeds the low-risk level. For men under 65, low-risk is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. A drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of spirits. You're actually in the high-risk category.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I didn't realize it was that bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;That's why this information is helpful. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being 'no desire to change' and 10 being 'strong desire to change,' how ready are you to make changes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I'm not sure. This is new information. I don't want to put myself at risk, and I consider myself healthy. I'd say a five.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;That's a good starting point. What made you choose a five instead of a lower number?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I'm training for a marathon, which is why I'm here. I need to get my sleep back on track. I also don't consider myself a hazardous drinker or an alcoholic. Hence, the five.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;I understand. So, your health is important, you're training for a marathon and want to succeed, and you were surprised to be in the high-risk category.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;Given this, what are you willing to do to change?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I suppose cutting back on my drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;What would that look like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Maybe no more than three or four times a week, and on weekends, no more than five or six beers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Writing down goals can be helpful.  If you were to set a goal for your drinking, what would it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;That's a step in the right direction.  Keep in mind that 18 drinks still exceeds the low-risk category. My recommendation would be to aim for 14 or fewer per week eventually. But this is a good start, and I commend you for your willingness to consider this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;We can discuss your progress at your next appointment next month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;0;Therapist;There, um, what brings you in today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;1;Client;I don't know. I'm just having a little bit of trouble dealing with my criminal history and trying to stay on the right path, but it gets kind of overwhelming. I really want to be a good productive member of society, but I got this background that nobody will overlook. So it kind of makes it like, what do I go back to what I know? I mean, you can only work for $5, $6, $7 an hour for so long, and it's really frustrating. It's causing some anger issues to resurface and some depression to resurface, and I don't want to fall back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;2;Therapist;It's really getting in the way of you becoming who you want to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;3;Client;Yes, it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;4;Therapist;So what about your criminal record is blocking you from getting where you want to be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;5;Client;I don't know what about it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;6;Therapist;Your record has a conviction?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;7;Client;Yeah. It has a felony conviction on it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;8;Therapist;Okay. Ah, there's the big trouble. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;9;Client;Yeah, it is. And it's-- I hadn't anticipated that it would have been-- You know, so at the time, it was just like, 'Okay, cool. I'm not going to jail.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;10;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;11;Client;You know, and, um, now, it's like, okay, so this is more like a life sentence than it was a four-year sentence that they were offering. You know, I mean, I think it would have been bad either way, but, um, I hadn't anticipated that this was going to be this difficult, especially since I went back to school and got a degree and actually want to do some corporate level or professional type of work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;12;Therapist;Mm-hmm. So when you put in applications or anything like that, the felony conviction, whether you know it or not, seems to knock you out of the ballpark. You're not even considered as an applicant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;13;Client;No, I'm not. Um, in situations where I don't know about it, I mean, if I'm not considered because of that, I probably-- Um, you know, that sucks too. Don't get me wrong. I mean, I-I don't- I don't get callbacks a lot because of that issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;14;Therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;15;Client;I'm sure. The ones that really count are, you know, are kind of just, you know, making me so angry and, you know, kind of spilling over into the rest of my life or the ones that I get face to face, especially after a really good interview.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;16;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;17;Client;Black and white. It just stops right there. 'I'm sorry. I can't really do much for you. I-- You have to go,' you know, and it's.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;18;Therapist;So do you- do you, um, put out there about the felony conviction before you even go for the interview?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;19;Client;No. I mean, there's different situations, you know. Sometimes they ask and, you know, I'll say something like, 'We'll discuss at interview.' Uh, sometimes, there are situations where if I probably put that, I don't get a callback and those situations I don't know about. You know, but there are also times where I get an interview through, um, you know, uh, some sort of connection or something, or like a buddy of mine or a family member will send me on an interview. You know, I don't have to fill out an application for that. They just usually, you know, give you the interview. And at the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;20;Therapist;Seems like it's a done deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;21;Client;Yeah. It seems like it's a done deal. You just have to go through the motion of having the interview. And then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;22;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;23;Client;When I go through the interview and it goes well, and they're like, 'Okay, well, you know, I think we can do something' and then, 'Here, sign this, sign that,' and the other thing. And it's like, but we just had a great, you know, I mean, I qualify. Like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;24;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;25;Client;And.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;26;Therapist;So you didn't hurt anybody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;27;Client;No, I didn't.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;28;Therapist;You didn't hurt anything, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;29;Client;It's really frustrating because.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;30;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;31;Client;It's almost like I-I don't want to give up, but it's like, I'm not given any other choice, you know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;32;Therapist;Yeah, 'cause you're-you're, especially with going back to school and having done all that footwork and stuff. I mean, you really have something to offer somebody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;33;Client;I do, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;34;Therapist;Yeah. And, um, and at the time the big crisis was actually maybe prison and all the crisis around the arrest and, uh, you know, it's like you're a leper and the leper colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;35;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;36;Therapist;Um, have there been any times when you've started the interview with that conversation so that you don't even have to go through the whole thing and then get rejected?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;37;Client;Not that I can think of, no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;38;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;39;Client;I think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;40;Therapist;What do you think would happen if you did that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;41;Client;Probably get booted out right away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;42;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;43;Client;You know. Um.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;44;Therapist;Would that be, um, what would they be like versus getting through this great interview, knowing you're-you're good for the job and all that kind of stuff, and then they boot you out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;45;Client;Well, it sucks either way. You know what I mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;46;Therapist;Mm-hmm. It's, uh, I mean the lesser of two evils is that what we're getting at?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;47;Client;Mm-hmm. You know what I mean? If it's going to make things more efficient like as if-if you're what you're trying to say is if that's something that I could do and then if they get past it, then now I know that there's an actual intention by the hiring people to hire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;48;Therapist;Right. If that's a deal-breaker and you both know it from the very beginning, I'm wondering if then really the interview is really something else. I mean, whether they get the job would truly be based on the interview and not-not your criminal record.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;49;Client;Yeah, I think as far as maybe efficiency, you know, weeding out the things, not wasting my time, you know, but I had to tell you something, a lot of the people that don't care about that type of thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;50;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;51;Client;Are not the sort of jobs that I really want to be doing. You know what I mean? Um, I don't know, it's just really frustrating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;52;Therapist;Not like you're working for the government or for a bank or, you know, the FBI where those are not things you're applying for. They're jobs where you would wonder why a non-violent felony would even.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;53;Client;Be an issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;54;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;55;Client;Right, and then the other thing is anybody that I might tell that to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;56;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;57;Client;That doesn't care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;58;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;59;Client;Are probably not jobs that, you know, are worth going to get the interview.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;60;Therapist;Mm-hmm, you didn't go to college for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;61;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;62;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;63;Client;Do you know what I mean? If I want to work at a moving company and I tell them off the bat, you know, from the gate, I tell them I have a felony conviction, just so you know before the interview and they don't really mind. I mean, that's great, you know, but at the same time, I don't- I'm not looking to be a mover or.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;64;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;65;Client;A burger flipper or something like that. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but I feel like I have a little bit more to offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;66;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;67;Client;You know, and, um, I don't know, it's a really, it's-it's like being caught between a rock and a hard place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;68;Therapist;Mm-hmm. So, what have you looked into about, um, you know, advocacy in that area or expungement or anything like that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;high;reducing recidivism;69;Client;I have done, and my eyes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;0;Therapist;Hi Liz, thanks for meeting with me today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;1;Client;Sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;2;Therapist;So, what's something you'd like to change or work towards?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;3;Client;Well, I've been thinking about working out lately. I really want to start working out again. It's been on my mind, I know I need to do it. It's just getting the motivation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;4;Therapist;It sounds like you've been giving this a lot of thought, and it's something you genuinely want to do.  It's understandable that motivation can be a challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;5;Client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;6;Therapist;So, if you could wave a magic wand and instantly have the ideal workout routine in place, what would that look like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;7;Client;Wow, um... I guess I'd be going to the gym maybe three or four times a week, for about an hour each time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;8;Therapist;That sounds like a great goal.  What makes that ideal for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;9;Client;Well, I know that's what's recommended for seeing results, and I used to do that. But honestly, the biggest hurdle is the time commitment. An hour at the gym turns into two hours with travel, and that's hard to fit in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;10;Therapist;So, the time commitment feels like the biggest obstacle right now.  It sounds like you're already aware of what works for you in terms of frequency and duration, but the practicalities of fitting it into your schedule are the real challenge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;11;Client;Exactly!  It's not that I don't want to, it's just finding the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;12;Therapist;Okay, so let's explore that a bit.  Instead of focusing on the ideal scenario right away, what's a small, realistic step you could take this week towards your goal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;13;Client;Hmm... maybe I could try going just once this week, for maybe 30 minutes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;14;Therapist;That sounds like a great starting point.  It's achievable and allows you to ease back into it. What day and time might work best for that 30-minute session?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;15;Client;Maybe Tuesday evening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;16;Therapist;Tuesday evening sounds good.  So, you're thinking a 30-minute workout on Tuesday evening.  How confident are you that you can make that happen on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident and 10 is completely confident?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;17;Client;Probably a 7 or 8.  Things can come up, but I think I can manage it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;18;Therapist;That's great! An 7 or 8 shows you're committed. What could help you move that up to a 9 or 10?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;19;Client;Maybe if I pack my gym bag the night before, so I'm ready to go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;20;Therapist;That's a fantastic idea.  So, packing your gym bag the night before will help boost your confidence.  So, to recap, you're aiming for a 30-minute workout on Tuesday evening, and you'll pack your gym bag the night before to help you stick to that plan. How does that sound?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;21;Client;Sounds good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;22;Therapist;Great.  We can check in next time and see how it went.  Remember, even small steps forward are still progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;23;Client;Okay, thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;low;managing life;24;Therapist;You're welcome, Liz.  See you next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Before you go, do you mind if I take a look at the questionnaire you filled out before the visit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Thanks. I want you to know that whenever patients and I talk about alcohol and drugs, my role is to share information and learn from what they want to do, if anything. Does that make sense?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Great. So, you wrote here that you've used alcohol in the last year on at least eight days?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Yeah. Somewhere around eight days. I'm not sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Okay. How would you describe your drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Um, I really only drink at parties. I don't drink at home or anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;Okay. What kind of alcohol do you drink at parties?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Um, liquor, whenever people are mixing, um, vodka, sometimes beer, but I don't like beer very much. Um, the drinks at parties are usually like vodka and orange juice or gin and tonics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;How much do you think you usually drink at a party?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;You mean the whole time I'm there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Um, probably four or five drinks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Okay. You checked the box here that drinking helps you feel relaxed, feel better about yourself or fit in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Yeah. It makes me feel relaxed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;And you also checked that sometimes you forget things when you drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;What kind of things do you forget?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Um, I forget how many drinks I've had like when a friend asks me or I forget whose house I'm at.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Sometimes you forget where you're at.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;Here's the part where I share information. The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks. That's because we know a number of negative things are more likely to happen when adolescents drink. We know alcohol can harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by accident. Sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do with the possibility of having an STD?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Um, yeah. I was drinking the last time I had sex. Um, the guy had been drinking too, and we didn't use a condom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Do you remember giving consent when you had sex?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;Yeah. We've had sex before and we've used a condom before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;How do you think drinking alcohol affected using a condom this time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Well, we just didn't stop to put one on. We weren't thinking that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;Sounds like drinking changes how you think in those moments?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Yeah. I would've definitely told him to put on a condom if I was sober.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;There's something else I want to share. When people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;Well, that's not me. I don't need help from anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;Um, well, it's fun. I like drinking when my friends are drinking too. Um, I laugh more. It's just fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;Okay. And what about your drinking do you not like?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;Um, I don't like forgetting where I'm at sometimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;Anything else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;I really don't want any STDs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;Right. So, on one hand, you like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and on the other hand, you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many drinks you've had and you don't like putting yourself at risk for STDs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;So, when you think about what you like and not like about your drinking, where do you want to go from here? What would you like to change about your drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;Well, I definitely don't want to drink too much again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;How ready are you to not drink too much? If I asked you to pick a number on a scale of 0 to 10, and 10 being totally ready, what number would you pick?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;Um, a nine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;Very ready to stop drinking too much. Why do you think you picked such a high number like nine rather than a lower number like a six or a seven?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;Well, I really don't want any STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;Okay. What plan could you come up with to make sure you achieve that goal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;Um, well, I want to count my drinks so I don't have more than two and I want to stop drinking once I start feeling drunk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;Great. Who could help you reach this goal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;Client;Well, I have this friend who thinks I drink too much. She would probably be willing to make me promise not to have more than two drinks at a party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;Therapist;Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience that again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;Client;I'm going to talk with him and I'm going to make him promise that we always use a condom and that we don't have sex drunk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;Therapist;All right. So, you're very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two drinks at parties and keep from having unprotected sex. I would like to share how it's working for you. What do you think about coming back in six weeks or so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;Therapist;Great. Thanks for talking with me and I look forward to seeing you again soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Therapist;So, tell me about the exercise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;Well, since we spoke last, I've been to the gym a couple of times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;You have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;That's fantastic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;Yeah, and actually, my pants feel a little better too. I'm very pleased with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;So, what else have you noticed other than your pants fitting better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;Um, I do feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;My back—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;Your... what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;Well, my back doesn't hurt nearly so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;Wow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;And, um, but it seems like it's still hard. I'd like to go more often, or I guess I'm just need to be a little more patient with myself because it's, um, I'm not— I want to be able to spend more time at the gym, but right now, it's not— Well, I guess I need to build up to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;Mm-hmm. So, what would help you get to building up to it? Spending more time there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;15;Client;Um, well, I guess just sticking with it and not getting sidetracked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;16;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;17;Client;Like last week, I didn't get there at all until like Thursday during the week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;18;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;19;Client;So it was a frustrating week for the gym that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;20;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;21;Client;I was kind of busy with some other things, but, um—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;22;Therapist;Mm-hmm. But you made it one day—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;23;Client;I got—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;24;Therapist;Instead of zero days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;25;Client;Yeah, and actually, I made it again on Saturday too. So.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;26;Therapist;That's fantastic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;28;Therapist;Even with this, you know, pretty hectic schedule going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;29;Client;Yeah. It's been a little hectic, you know. And, uh— But, I don't like it too much because there's all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they can stay on the treadmill longer, and it's a little discouraging, you know. 'Cause I don't know if you've noticed, I'm not buff, and they are. And it's a little discouraging to think how much work it's going to take to get, you know, kind of back towards that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;30;Therapist;So you'd like to get buff?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;31;Client;No, but, um, when I'm not at the gym, and I am my normal rational self, I realize that I'm, you know, way past the age where I would really even want to do that, let alone want to spend the time it takes. But then while I'm at the gym, and I see the buff young guys, you know, lifting a lot of weight and all that stuff, then, you know, the urge to be buff comes up in me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;32;Therapist;So, but for right now, it sounds like just having the pants fit better—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;33;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;34;Therapist;Sounds really like it's making you feel good about yourself, and—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;35;Client;It is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;36;Therapist;What other positive things have you noticed about the exercise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;37;Client;Well, I noticed— Well, I still need to work on my diet a lot. I haven't— I'd like to say that by working out at the gym, I have modified my diet, but I haven't very much. I've gotten a little bit better with that, but I'd like to do a lot more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;38;Therapist;In what way have you gotten a little bit better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;39;Client;Um, a little bit less junk food. Um, like at times, when I feel like, 'Oh, I think I'll just go have a candy bar,' or some worthless thing like that, I'll actually have second thoughts before I do it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;40;Therapist;So you're at the second thought part. And what do you think might take you over to actually doing it if you wanted to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;41;Client;Well, I think when I really start seeing some results at the gym, it's kind of— I think the way it works in my mind is if I've worked out really hard and I've— say I've lost a pound that week—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;42;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;43;Client;You know, and then as I'm looking at that double or triple fudge four-decker ice cream sundae thing, you know, that somebody is eating, I would say, 'Wow, that would be about two hours on the treadmill.' Then that would probably— the— that would—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;44;Therapist;Oh, okay. The payoff just wouldn't be worth those two hours of treadmill versus that double fudge brownie thingy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;45;Client;Right, decadent— Why do they put the word decadent in food?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;46;Therapist;'Cause it is decadent, it's lovely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;47;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;48;Therapist;Yeah, yummy, so—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;high;diet and weight loss management;49;Client;Okay. But it seems to be going so far so good. I guess, you know, I can, you know, um, I'm— I'm pretty pleased with how it's going on. Um, I'm really glad we talked that last time 'cause it was the impetus to get me to go the first time in a long, long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Okay, so I've prescribed an antibiotic for Aiden's ear infection.  It seems he's had quite a few of these in the past year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;1;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;That must be tough on both of you.  It sounds stressful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;3;Client;It really is. He gets so upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;I understand.  One of the main risk factors for frequent ear infections in children is exposure to smoke. Do you smoke?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;5;Client;Yes, I do. But I try really hard not to smoke around him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;I appreciate that.  It's great that you're aware of the risks.  Since Aiden is still getting these infections, it suggests he's being exposed to smoke somehow. Can you tell me more about your smoking habits and how you manage it around him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;7;Client;I try my best. I never smoke in the car, and when he's home, I always go outside. I know it's bad for him, and I don't want him around it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;It sounds like you're really trying to protect him, and I commend you for that.  It's also understandable that quitting smoking can be incredibly challenging. Many people struggle with it.  It's important to understand that even smoking outside, while a good step, can still expose him to secondhand smoke through residue on clothing, hair, and in the environment.  This is sometimes called 'thirdhand smoke'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;9;Client;I didn't realize that. I thought going outside was enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;It's a common misconception.  It's great that you're already motivated to protect Aiden.  Quitting smoking is the most effective way to eliminate this risk.  It would also have significant benefits for your own health.  Have you considered quitting before?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;11;Client;I've thought about it, but it's really hard. I don't know how.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;I hear you. Quitting is definitely a process, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Many people find it helpful to have support and a plan.  We can work together to explore some strategies that might work for you.  There are many resources available, including nicotine replacement therapies like patches, gum, and lozenges, as well as medications that can help reduce cravings.  We can also discuss counseling and support groups.  Would you be open to exploring some of these options?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;13;Client;I guess. I'm just so busy. I don't know if I have time for all of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;I understand that time is a precious commodity. However, consider this: How much time do you spend dealing with Aiden's ear infections?  The doctor's visits, the sleepless nights, his discomfort… Quitting smoking could potentially reduce these episodes, freeing up time and energy in the long run.  Also, think about how much time you spend on smoking itself.  Quitting could actually give you more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;15;Client;That's a good point. I hadn't thought of it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;It’s about finding what works for you.  We can start small.  Perhaps we could schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss this further and create a personalized plan.  No pressure, just a chance to explore some options.  How does that sound?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;17;Client;Okay. I think I could do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;Great.  In the meantime, perhaps you could start thinking about what you find most challenging about the idea of quitting.  Knowing your triggers and what makes it difficult can help us tailor a plan that addresses your specific needs.  We’re in this together.  It’s a journey, and I’m here to support you every step of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;low;smoking cessation;19;Client;Okay. Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;0;Therapist;Well, I want to thank you for coming in today to see me. Um, I do understand from talking with your counselor that you've got quite a bit on your plate, you've got a lot going on. Can you tell me a little bit about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;1;Client;Well, um, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full time as a server at a restaurant, and then recently, I also started going back to night class, so you know, just the combination of all that, you know. I-I've just been feeling really stressed lately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;2;Therapist;Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I ask, are you also a single mom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;3;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;4;Therapist;So you've got a lot of stressors right now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. What do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;5;Client;Well, I-I told the counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;6;Therapist;Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;7;Client;Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. You know, she like will back out at the last second, and so I've had to call in at work a couple of times. I've had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether I'll be able to do those things or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;8;Therapist;Okay. So I'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;9;Client;Yeah, exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;10;Therapist;Okay. Um, outside your mom, is there anyone else that can help with childcare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;11;Client;Um, well, I have a sister, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many people that-- the only thing I can think of, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. She-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;12;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;13;Client;Um, I don't really know her that well, but I mean, she seems nice and I-I think she did a pretty good job that night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;14;Therapist;Hmm. So what I hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;15;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;16;Therapist;Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;17;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;18;Therapist;Okay. Let's pursue that neighbor a little bit. Um, people like that, I like to think of as natural resources, but I know for a lot of people, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;19;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;20;Therapist;Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;21;Client;I-- you know, I mean, maybe a little bit, but I don't really make that much money to be able to afford something like daycare or, you know, like full time babysitting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;22;Therapist;Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;23;Client;Well, I mean, I-I like cooking. I'm-I'm actually in school for culinary arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;24;Therapist;Oh, I bet you're a really good cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare dinner for her and her, um, daughter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;25;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;26;Therapist;Um, you know, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. What do you think of a idea like that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;27;Client;Hmm. That's, that's interesting. I-I never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;28;Therapist;Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;29;Client;Hmm. No, I-- you know, there-there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;30;Therapist;Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;31;Client;[chuckles] No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;32;Therapist;Okay, fine. You know what? We've got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;33;Client;It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;34;Therapist;Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;35;Client;Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;36;Therapist;Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;37;Client;I mean, I think so, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;38;Therapist;All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;39;Client;Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;40;Therapist;Okay. Sounds like you got a good plan to follow up on there. All right. Um, now you mentioned that your son is two. When will he turn three?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;41;Client;Just a couple months from now. He's almost three.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;42;Therapist;Okay. Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? Are you familiar with that program?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;43;Client;I've heard of it, but I don't know that much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;44;Therapist;Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually for going to school. Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;45;Client;Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;46;Therapist;Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;47;Client;[chuckles] Well, you know, I-I've been working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the evenings, especially has-has been hard, but, um, you know, a couple of nights I have reached my goal in terms of, you know, number of cigarettes I'm going to smoke and number of drinks. So, I mean, I've done okay some days, but others, not so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;48;Therapist;Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;49;Client;Yeah, yeah. I definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony to smoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;high;managing life;50;Therapist;Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Okay, hard part's over. So the good news is no cavities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Oh, great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;Yes, always happy to hear that. I do have some concerns though because I'm seeing some irritation in your mouth in the palate that's called nicotinic stomatitis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;That sounds bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;Yeah, it is. It's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit about how tobacco fits in your life right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;Tobacco. Well, I don't smoke cigarettes. I've never smoked cigarettes. I do go out with my friends. Um, you know, we go out to bars and, you know, we'll have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigarillo-type things. I mean I wouldn't even think of them as cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes. Um, and I mean I'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my friends but certainly not 20 or 30 of them a day like you would with cigarettes and that's the only thing that could possibly have anything to do with tobacco.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;But that's- that's just like a- a social thing. That's something that my friends and I do. We-- We-- It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. Not packs of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;Yeah, so you're not-- You're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;Oh, no. No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;Well, we've-- you have a point there. Mm, now that you mention it, um, I have started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since I have a couple of friends at work that smoke and so every time we have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, and so I- now I go with them and I have one of these Swisher Sweets. Um, I like the peach flavor they're so cute. But that's really only pretty recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;Well, yeah, yeah. You know now that you say it like that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, um. Um, and you know, when, you know, I like to go to Las Vegas, and so when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains on them than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;Um. Well, there's the expense, you know. With the economy and all, um, I- I have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if I'm buying more of them than I used to. So the-the money aspect is also a concern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;23;Client;Oh, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;25;Client;Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;27;Client;Oh, yes. I checked the box on your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked 'No,' because I never thought of myself as a smoker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a tobacco user and that you might actually be causing some pretty serious health effects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;29;Client;I'm really concerned, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this conversation, I never really thought of myself as a smoker at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;30;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;31;Client;-I'm very concerned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;32;Therapist;Well, the good news is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;33;Client;Really?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;34;Therapist;Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;35;Client;Oh, I would. I really would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to see you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;36;Therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;37;Client;Oh, I think I will probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;38;Therapist;Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;39;Client;Because it's not a part of my daily life. I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in the morning. I don't smoke 20 or 30 of them a day, so it's not that much exposure and I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;40;Therapist;Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like just to kind of summarize, you've noticed some negative effects of the smoking, you have some concerns about health effects that could occur, there's the financial aspect, and yet you feel pretty confident that you could quit if you tried. So, where do you think we should go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;41;Client;Um, I'd really like some more information about quitting. I mean, I've heard there's some-some new medications, there are some new things that can be done to help people make quitting more comfortable and I-I really wanna quit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;42;Therapist;Okay, well, I'd be happy to talk to you more about that and give you some tips and advice and give you some suggestions about where you can get some support with quitting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;43;Client;That'd be wonderful. Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;44;Therapist;I really appreciate you talking to me about this today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;high;smoking cessation;45;Client;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;0;Therapist;Hi, are you Katie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;1;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;2;Therapist;Hi Katie, my name is Beth. I'm a nurse here.  I understand you filled out a health questionnaire while waiting to see Mrs. Smith, and it mentioned your marijuana use. Would you be comfortable talking with me about that for a few minutes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;3;Client;Uh, sure. What's this about?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;4;Therapist;It's just a chance to explore how marijuana fits into your life.  No worries, this is completely confidential and not about getting you in trouble.  We just want to understand your perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;5;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;6;Therapist;I noticed you mentioned using marijuana regularly. Can you tell me a little more about how often and in what situations you use it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;7;Client;Well, you know, they just decriminalized it, so it's not a big deal.  A couple times a week, just to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;8;Therapist;So, it sounds like marijuana helps you relax, especially given you're a student here on an academic scholarship and on the debate team, which sounds like a lot of pressure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;9;Client;Yeah. I mean, I'm the first in my family to go to college, so it's a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;10;Therapist;That's a huge accomplishment, and it's understandable that you might feel some pressure navigating college life. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;11;Client;I've always been kind of anxious, and pot just helps calm my nerves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;12;Therapist;It sounds like anxiety is something you've experienced for a while, and marijuana has become a way to manage that.  Tell me more about what you find helpful about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;13;Client;Well, some of the other kids here seem to have it all together, and when I use pot with them, I feel like I fit in a little better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;14;Therapist;So, it's also connected to feeling a sense of belonging and connection with your peers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;15;Client;Yeah, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;16;Therapist;It sounds like fitting in is important to you, and you're hoping marijuana helps with that. How's that working for you so far?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;17;Client;I'm not sure it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;18;Therapist;That's interesting.  It sounds like there might be a disconnect between hoping it helps you fit in and how it actually makes you feel. What are some of the downsides you've noticed, if any?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;19;Client;Well, I get nervous I'll get caught. My parents would be really upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;20;Therapist;So, the worry about getting caught and your parents' reaction adds to your stress, rather than taking it away. Is that fair to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;21;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;22;Therapist;Are there any other downsides you've noticed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;23;Client;Well, it's expensive, and I usually end up bumming it off my roommate, which is kind of embarrassing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;24;Therapist;So, it also brings up feelings about your financial situation. It sounds like marijuana use has both some benefits and some challenges for you. It helps you relax, but it also causes stress related to fitting in, getting caught, and finances.  How do you feel about all of that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;25;Client;When you put it that way, it doesn't sound so great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;26;Therapist;It sounds like you're starting to see the bigger picture. Katie, you mentioned earlier that you've always dealt with anxiety. Have you ever considered talking to a counselor about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;27;Client;No. We don't really do that in my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;28;Therapist;I understand. Sometimes there can be stigma around counseling.  What are your thoughts about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;29;Client;It's just not something we do.  And it costs money, which we don't have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;30;Therapist;I hear you.  Many students experience anxiety, especially in college, and counseling can be really helpful in developing coping skills.  Here at the college, we have free counseling services available to all students.  And it's completely confidential, so we wouldn't share anything with your parents unless there was a serious concern about your safety, like if you were thinking about harming yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;31;Client;I would never do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;32;Therapist;I understand.  I just want you to know the limits of confidentiality.  Would you be open to learning more about our counseling services?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;33;Client;I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;34;Therapist;No pressure at all.  I just wanted to make sure you're aware of the resources available to you.  Would you be comfortable if I walked you over to the counseling center so you know where it is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;35;Client;Okay, sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;36;Therapist;Great.  It's just down this hall.  We can stop by and I can introduce you to one of the counselors if you'd like, or you can just take a look around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;high;reducing drug use;37;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Chris, I wanted to talk with you. As Athletic Director, I keep tabs on players to ensure everyone performs their best. I heard about a party this weekend and understand you were there. I'd like to discuss how partying and alcohol fit into your life right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Could I confide something that's been bothering me? Before the party, my parents, knowing I'm an honor student, kept me away from social life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;About a month ago, friends invited me to a party, using my constant studying as leverage. I convinced my parents I'd sleep over at a friend's, which is when I started drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;It was a unique experience. It was fun at the time, so I kept doing it. This past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my mom to go to another party. She suspected what I was doing and asked me to promise no alcohol or drugs, and that she'd pick me up by midnight. I was surprised, as that's when parties usually start, but I agreed. I planned to delay her pickup time. I promised her, she dropped me off, and I partied and drank. When she picked me up, she immediately said, 'You drank vodka.' I was speechless and felt terrible for betraying her trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;So, you're an honors student, a star athlete, and have done everything you've been told. Last month, you started getting more involved in the party scene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;It was fun initially, but now you're noticing consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;Yes. I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;I sit in class with my mind elsewhere, especially on weekends, when I'd rather find ways to get alcohol with friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;It's changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I'm generally reserved, except in sports or social settings. I'm self-conscious.  Drinking relaxes me, and I can talk and engage with others more easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;So, it helps you loosen up and feel more relaxed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;You've noticed negative aspects: your mom's upset, decreased focus, struggling in school...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;Kind of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;Anything else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;My friend groups have changed. Some aren't into that scene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;I'm in one group, and I met people in another who invited me to that first party. Since then, I've been with them more, but I'm neglecting my other friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;So, there's tension with your friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;A little. Not all are into the party scene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Given these changes affecting friendships, studies, and your relationship with your mom, what's your next step?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;"I should stop. I'm realistic; these situations happen.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;I shouldn't take it too far, like blacking out or getting sick. That's not worth it. I need to rebuild trust with my mom. It seems small to others, but it's big for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;Your mom is important to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;Her opinion of you matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;How important is it to adjust your drinking or quit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;Very important, to regain my mom's trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;And to improve my schoolwork and athletics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;There's a future in that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;How confident are you that you can change your drinking, cut down, or quit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;Pretty confident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being not at all and 10 being completely, what number?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;Probably 8 or 9.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;"It can't be 10; nothing is. But I'm determined.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;Why 8 or 9, not 6 or 7?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;I'm determined because I hate how I felt after betraying my mom. I hate the feeling of vomiting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;It's unpleasant and something I don't want. Even if I drink, I don't want to get to that point. It's not worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;What's a realistic goal for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;Client;To prioritize studies and regain my mom's trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;Client;Then focus on studies. In my leisure time, I can party with friends, but partying doesn't mean drinking. One drink won't ruin my life, but I'd prefer not to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;Therapist;So, your goal is no alcohol, or at most, one drink at parties?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;Client;Exactly. To participate socially, but not excessively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;Therapist;Chris, I appreciate you talking about this. It's been on your mind. I care about you as a student and athlete and want what's best. You have a good plan: no alcohol, or a maximum of one drink. It sounds like it will work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;Client;Thank you for listening. It means a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;Therapist;My pleasure. It's my job. I'll get ready for practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Hi, Sandra. Thanks for coming in. I know your time is precious, especially with your daughter in the hospital, so I appreciate you making time to talk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;1;Client;Hi. Well, I came because of my daughter. I know I should quit, but it's hard. I enjoy smoking, and with everything going on, it feels like too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;I understand. It sounds like you're juggling a lot right now, and quitting smoking feels like another burden.  It's completely understandable that it's not at the top of your list. Tell me, what made you decide to come in at all, even with everything else happening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;3;Client;I feel like a terrible role model for my kids. My daughter's turning 12, and some of her friends are already trying smoking. I don't want her to think it's okay because of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;So, you're really concerned about the influence your smoking might have on your daughter, especially at this age when she's starting to be more aware of these things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;5;Client;Exactly. I started smoking young, and I definitely don't want that for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;It sounds like you're torn. You want to be a good role model, but quitting feels overwhelming.  Let's explore that a bit. What are some of the things you enjoy about smoking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;7;Client;It's relaxing. It helps with stress.  At work, we all go out for smoke breaks together, it's a social thing. I'd feel left out if I didn't smoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;So, smoking is a way to relax, connect with colleagues, and manage stress. What else do you like about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;9;Client;I like having a cigarette after a meal. It's like a signal that I'm done eating. It helps me control my weight sometimes, too. I might have a cigarette instead of a snack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;So, it also helps with appetite control. Anything else?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;11;Client;Hmm, I guess I just enjoy it. It's a habit. I know it's not good for me, but I'm so used to it. I don't really think about quitting much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;Okay, so let me see if I understand. You enjoy the relaxation, the social connection at work, it helps manage stress and appetite, and it's a long-standing habit.  Have I captured everything?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;13;Client;Yeah, that's pretty much it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;Now, let's think about the other side. What are some of the things you don't like about smoking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;15;Client;I worry about my kids. I feel guilty.  I don't want my daughter to start, especially since some of her friends already are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;Can you tell me about a specific time when you felt that guilt or concern about your daughter seeing you smoke?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;17;Client;Just this morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and I looked up, and she was watching me from the window.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;That must have been difficult.  Seeing her watch you like that, knowing how you feel about her smoking, how did that make you feel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;19;Client;Terrible. I want to be a good parent, and I know smoking isn't part of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;It sounds like being a good parent is really important to you. And yet, smoking is also something you enjoy and rely on. How do you reconcile those two things?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;21;Client;I don't.  It's a constant struggle. I know it's wrong, but it's hard to imagine life without it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;So, it's not that you don't *want* to quit, it's more that you're not sure *how* to make that happen, or how to make it a priority with everything else going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;23;Client;Exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;Okay.  I understand.  We're about out of time for today, but I'd like to continue this conversation next week if you're open to it.  Would that work for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;25;Client;Sure, I guess so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;Great. Between now and then, I'd like you to try something.  Think about the top three reasons you might consider quitting.  Just jot them down.  And also, reflect on the good things about smoking and the not-so-good things, like we talked about today.  It doesn't have to be anything formal, just some thoughts. Would you be willing to do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;27;Client;Okay, I'll try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;Perfect. Here's a booklet with some information that might be helpful. Thanks for coming in, Sandra. I'll see you next week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;high;smoking cessation;29;Client;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Dylan, thanks for coming in today. I understand from the university incident report that you were stopped on stadium road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence, and subsequently taken to detox.  The report also indicates you're 20 years old.  Can you confirm the accuracy of this report, and tell me a bit about what happened that evening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;Yeah, that's pretty much right. It was last week, and yeah, I was drunk. I drove over to a friend's place to watch the Vikings game. We had a few beers, and well, the Vikings weren't doing so great, so we ended up drinking more than we planned.  Then, at the end of the night, I couldn't get a ride home, so I drove.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;So, if I understand correctly, you drank more than you intended because the Vikings were losing, and when your friend couldn't give you a ride, you decided to drive yourself home. Is that accurate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Yeah, that's exactly what happened. I mean, I'm a normal college student. I like to drink with my friends. It wasn't even a big party or anything.  Just a few of us, and I still got caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;I hear you. It sounds like you were just trying to have a good time watching the game with friends, and you probably didn't fully consider the potential consequences of underage drinking, especially since it was a small gathering and you tried to find a ride home.  It's understandable that you feel frustrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Exactly. I did try to be responsible. I even tried calling my friend for a ride. But it didn't work out, and now I'm in trouble anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Dylan, you've told me what brought you here.  What do you see as the real problem?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;Well, I wouldn't say I have a drinking problem. I think I have more of a getting *caught* problem.  I mean, my other friends drink just as much, and they never get caught.  It feels like I was just unlucky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;It sounds like you're attributing this situation to bad luck.  If you continue to believe that, and don't make any changes to your behavior, what do you think might happen down the road?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;I guess...more trouble with the police and the school.  And I really don't have the time or money for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;How important is it to you to avoid future problems with the police and the school?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Really important.  Going to detox was awful. I don't ever want to go through that again.  And my dad said if I get suspended, I have to go work on my uncle's farm in Iowa. That would be a social disaster.  Plus, my parents already took my car away after the DUI.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;So, what would you be willing to do to avoid detox again and getting suspended?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;I guess... the obvious thing is to not drink so much. And try to avoid situations where I'm more likely to get into trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most confident, how confident are you that you can stick to that plan?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Probably around a six. Maybe a little over halfway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;What steps could you take to move that six to a seven or an eight?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I guess... a big part of it is where I drink.  Like, if I only drink at my apartment, I'm not risking driving.  Or, if I go to a party, maybe wait until I'm 21. And maybe find other things to do besides drinking.  This town has got to have more going on than just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;How might your life be better if you're successful in making these changes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;Well, I wouldn't be hungover all the time. I could actually make it to my 8 AM classes.  Even when I do go now, I just end up sleeping through them and missing everything.  If I could re-prioritize what's important, I think I could do better in school. I had a 3.5 GPA in high school, so I know I'm capable of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;College is about choices.  Tell me about the values that are important to you, and how those values connect with your decisions about drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Education is really important to me, and my family too. My parents are always talking about it. I really want to be an international journalist.  So, if I can re-prioritize and not drink so much, I won't disappoint my parents, and I'll have a better chance of getting a good education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;Thanks for sharing that, Dylan.  So, the university's decision is that you'll be placed on disciplinary probation and you'll need to attend an alcohol education seminar. The seminar fee is $150.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;Okay. When is the seminar?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Dylan, the Minnesota State Mankato security report indicates you were stopped on stadium road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence, and transported to detox.  The report also lists your age as 20. Is this report accurate? Can you tell me about what happened that night?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;1;Client;Yeah, it's pretty much all true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;Okay, I understand. It sounds like a difficult situation.  Can you tell me a bit more about what led up to the incident?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;3;Client;Well, I was at a party...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;Okay. So, it sounds like you were at a party, and then you were driving. Is that right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;5;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;And how much had you had to drink that night?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;7;Client;I don't know, a few beers maybe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;A few. Okay. So, thinking back to that night, how do you feel about the choices you made?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;9;Client;Not good. I messed up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;It sounds like you're feeling some regret.  Is that fair to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;11;Client;Yeah, definitely. I could have hurt someone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;That's a very real concern, and it shows you're taking this seriously.  It's good that you recognize the potential consequences.  What are your thoughts about drinking and driving in general?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;13;Client;It's stupid. I know that. I just didn't think...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;It sounds like you know the risks, but maybe in the moment, it was hard to make the best decision. Is that something you've struggled with before – making good decisions about alcohol?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;15;Client;Sometimes. I mean, everyone drinks at parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;It's true that drinking is common, especially in social situations. But everyone's different, and everyone's body reacts differently to alcohol. What have you noticed about how alcohol affects you specifically?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;17;Client;I get… loud.  And I make bad choices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;Loud and making bad choices.  So, it sounds like you have some awareness of how alcohol changes your behavior.  That’s a really important insight. What do you think might be helpful for you going forward to avoid situations like this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;19;Client;I guess… not drink so much? Or not drive after drinking at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;Those sound like some really good starting points.  So, if you were in a similar situation again, what could you do differently?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;21;Client;I could… call a cab. Or a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;That's a great idea. Having a plan is really important. It sounds like you're already thinking about some positive changes. What feels most important to you about making these changes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;23;Client;Just… not screwing up my life. And not hurting anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;Those are powerful motivators. It sounds like you have a strong sense of responsibility.  What do you think might get in the way of making these changes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;25;Client;My friends. They'll think I'm lame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;That's understandable. It can be tough when your friends are doing something different. But it also sounds like you're starting to think about what's important for *you*.  What do you think is more important – fitting in, or staying safe and avoiding these kinds of situations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;27;Client;Staying safe, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;It sounds like you're really starting to connect with why these changes are important for you.  What's one small step you could take this week to move in the direction of those changes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;29;Client;Maybe… talk to a friend who doesn't drink much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;30;Therapist;That's a great idea.  Connecting with someone supportive could be really helpful.  We can also talk more about resources and strategies in our next session. How does that sound?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;low;smoking cessation;31;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;0;Therapist;Molly, thanks for coming in to talk with me today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;1;Client;You're welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;2;Therapist;I understand from your mom that you've been having some difficulties with other kids at school, some bullying and things like that. That must be tough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;3;Client;Yeah. I've missed two days of school already because of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;4;Therapist;Missing that much school is significant.  It sounds like things are escalating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;5;Client;And even when I'm out, rumors start.  Like last time, I was supposedly in the principal's office all day with security guards, which wasn't true at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;6;Therapist;It's frustrating when people spread untrue stories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;7;Client;It's been happening since fifth or sixth grade. I get blamed for everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;8;Therapist;Why do you think that is? What kind of things do they blame you for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;9;Client;I think it's because I tend to engage. Like if someone tells me something, I don't just let it go. I want to talk about it, and I think some kids see me as an easy target.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;10;Therapist;So, tell me more about this 'engaging.' Can you give me an example?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;11;Client;If someone says, 'I heard something about you,' I'll ask, 'Oh really? What is it?' and I just keep it going.  Or if someone says they want to beat me up, I might say, 'Okay, then hit me.' I don't walk away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;12;Therapist;And what usually happens when you don't walk away?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;13;Client;It usually escalates.  If I just stopped it, maybe they wouldn't know what to say. But if I keep talking, it builds up, and then we both get in trouble and sent to the principal's office.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;14;Therapist;So, what's it like for you after you've been in the principal's office?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;15;Client;I usually tell myself I should just let it go next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;16;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;17;Client;But if someone says something about me, it makes me mad.  I try to stop myself, but sometimes I still say things. I'm trying to get better, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;18;Therapist;You mentioned trying to get better. Tell me about a time recently when you handled a situation differently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;19;Client;There was this one time someone was talking to me, and I just said, 'Wow, this is really lame. I'm just going to leave.' And I did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;20;Therapist;That's great. How did that feel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;21;Client;I felt proud of myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;22;Therapist;You should be. What helped you do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;23;Client;I thought about how my mom gets mad when I don't let things go. She tells me to leave it be, but I don't always listen. So I tried to think about her feelings and what would happen if I just walked away. They stopped talking to me, and I didn't get in trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;24;Therapist;It's impressive that you can consider your mom's perspective like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;25;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;26;Therapist;That's a real strength. So, this time you thought about your mom, you walked away, you felt proud, and nothing bad happened. Is that right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;27;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;28;Therapist;Does it usually work that way?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;29;Client;Yeah. They stopped talking to me.  The funny thing was, these were eighth graders who don't even go to my school. I don't even know how they started talking to me. It was weird.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;30;Therapist;So, when someone told you that you're an easy target...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;31;Client;They don't really say that to me directly. I just think that's what it is because that's what I've heard from my mom, and because I keep engaging with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;32;Therapist;Okay, so they know how to get a reaction from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;33;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;34;Therapist;And then things escalate, and you get in trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;35;Client;Yeah. It happens a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;36;Therapist;So, you know that 'channeling your mom' helps. What other ideas do you have about what you could do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;37;Client;I was thinking that if something happens at school during class, I could ask to use the restroom just to get away and think about how to handle it.  Like in gym class, there was this girl I'd had trouble with before. We were playing pickleball, and I just told my gym teacher quietly that I couldn't be near her and asked to move to a different court.  He let me switch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;38;Therapist;That was a really good decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;39;Client;The girl was annoyed, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;40;Therapist;But it was smart of you to recognize that something bad might happen if you had to play with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;41;Client;Yeah. I probably would have smacked her or something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;42;Therapist;You knew that about yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;43;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;44;Therapist;So you know which kids tend to push your buttons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;45;Client;Yeah, there are a few.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;46;Therapist;That's okay. The important thing is for you to be happy and safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;47;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;48;Therapist;So, it sounds like you've got some good strategies already.  It's tough, though. Kids can be mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;49;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;50;Therapist;I'm wondering if you'd like to meet again to talk more about this. You've got some good ideas, and I'm also open to you bringing a friend along if that would be helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;51;Client;Yeah, there's one friend who might want to talk about some stuff. She doesn't have a lot of support at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;52;Therapist;Okay. I want this session to be primarily for you, Molly, but I'm also happy to talk with your friend. It sounds like she could use someone to listen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;53;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;54;Therapist;We can explore some other ways to help you deal with this, because it sounds like some kids are being really unfair to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;55;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;56;Therapist;So, would you be willing to come back and talk some more?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;57;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;58;Therapist;Great. I also want to tell you that I think you're doing a great job handling a really difficult situation. High school is tough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;59;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;60;Therapist;It is. I think things can get better.  I'm glad you're involved in swimming and other activities.  Those kinds of things can connect you with good people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;61;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;62;Therapist;Okay, is there anything else you want to talk about today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;63;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;high;addressing bullying;64;Therapist;Okay. Thanks, Molly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;Therapist;Hello, it's good to see you again. What brings you in today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;Client;I'm concerned about my drinking. I think I'm drinking too much, and I'd like to talk to someone about it and get some help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;Therapist;So, it sounds like you feel your drinking has become a problem for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;Client;Yes, it's gotten worse over the past six months.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;Therapist;What makes you say it's gotten worse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;Client;Well, I used to drink like most people, but I broke up with my boyfriend about a year ago.  Six months ago, I started going out again to meet people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;Client;And I've gotten into this habit of going out every Friday and Saturday, drinking a lot to try to meet guys.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;Therapist;I see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;Client;And lately, I've been drinking more on weeknights, which I never used to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;Therapist;So, you've noticed an increase in your drinking over the past six months, particularly since you started going out again to meet someone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;Client;Yes. I'm not comfortable talking to guys normally. Drinking helps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;Therapist;So, it sounds like drinking helps calm your nerves when you're trying to meet potential partners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;Client;Yes, definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;Therapist;Potential partners as in men?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;Client;I mean, I guess most people drink when they go out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;Therapist;That's common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;Client;But I've been drinking more and more, and it's not even working. I'm not meeting anyone, and I just end up with a massive hangover all weekend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;Therapist;That's frustrating. It sounds like on the one hand, drinking helps you feel more comfortable talking to men, but on the other hand, it's not actually helping you meet anyone, and it's leading to hangovers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;Client;Exactly. I might talk to someone, but I'm usually too drunk. My friends drive me home, and the night is a blur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;Therapist;So, what would you like to do about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;Client;I want to stop. I'm drinking more and more, even on weekdays, and I don't want to do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;Client;I'm not eating properly anymore. I'm eating less or just getting takeout food. I'm not exercising like I used to, either. I want to cut back on my drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;Therapist;So, it sounds like you really want to stop drinking, especially on weekdays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;Client;Yes, I do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;Therapist;Because you've noticed it's negatively impacting your eating and exercise habits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;Client;Yes. I don't want to stop altogether, though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;Therapist;I understand. It sounds like drinking has some benefits for you, like the social aspect of going out with friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;Client;Yes, and all my friends drink. I wouldn't have a social life if I didn't drink at all. I don't feel like I'm an alcoholic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;Therapist;So, you enjoy the social aspect of going out with friends, and you don't want to give that up completely. It sounds like you want to find a balance where you're not experiencing negative consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;Client;Yes, it's just gotten a bit out of control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;Therapist;Have you tried to cut back on your drinking in the past?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;Client;No, this hasn't happened before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;Therapist;So, this is the first time you've experienced this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;Client;Yes. Before, I was in a relationship for six years. My friends weren't drinking as much then. It's all new.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;Therapist;Okay. It's good that you've identified what's happening and that you've noticed the pattern with your drinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;Therapist;On a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 is extremely important and 0 is not important at all, how important is it for you to cut back on your drinking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;Client;I'd say 80. That's why I'm here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;Therapist;80 is quite high. What makes it an 80 rather than a 50?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;Client;It just got to a point where it felt like too much.  No one else is drinking as much as I am during the week. I need to do something about it now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;Therapist;So, you have a strong sense of needing to make a change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;Client;Yes. I'm worried it will get worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;Therapist;So, over the last six months, you've noticed this pattern, it's had negative impacts on your lifestyle, and you're ready to make a change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;Therapist;What do you think the next step is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;Client;That's why I'm here. I think cutting back on weekdays is what I really need to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;Client;And then maybe try to plan things out a bit more on weekends so it doesn't get out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;Therapist;So, you're thinking about keeping weekdays alcohol-free?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;Client;Yes, exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;Therapist;How does that sound as a first step?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;Client;Good. That's definitely what I want to do. I'm out of routine with exercise and everything. I need to get back into things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;Therapist;You sound motivated to make a change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;Client;Yes, talking about it makes me realize I need to do something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;Therapist;That's excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;0;Therapist;Thanks for coming in. Tell me what's been happening since we last spoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;1;Client;Well, I, um, I did get an interview for a job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;2;Therapist;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;3;Client;Yeah, but I wasn't able to go, um, because of my kids. I didn't have anyone to watch them. So, I had to cancel the interview. It's too bad because it was a job that would have been good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;4;Therapist;You sound disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;5;Client;Well, yeah, because I didn't really have a choice. I have to make sure my kids are taken care of first. I'm worried this is going to keep happening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;6;Therapist;It's going to keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;7;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;8;Therapist;Tell me, on a scale from one to 10, how important is it for you to get a job?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;9;Client;About a 10. I'm the only one supporting my kids, and what I'm getting from welfare is not enough. I really need a job soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;10;Therapist;You have to provide for your children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;11;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;12;Therapist;On a scale from one to 10, how confident are you that you could get a job?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;13;Client;Right now, about a three. Even if I get an interview and find childcare, my resume isn't impressive. It has employment gaps, and I'm not as educated as other applicants. I don't feel employable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;14;Therapist;So, the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and finding something that works would be helpful. You're also feeling not so great about your resume and experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;15;Client;Yeah. It's so limited, and I've been out of the workforce. Even when I was working, it's not stuff that I feel can lead to the job I want now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;16;Therapist;What is it that you want?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;17;Client;Something steady where I can be home every night with my kids. I'd like something where I'm making good money and I don't have to worry about money all the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;18;Therapist;If you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;19;Client;Yeah. It would be huge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;20;Therapist;It would provide the income you need, and you wouldn't worry so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;21;Client;Yeah. It'd be nice to just know what I'm doing and have my routine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;22;Therapist;Every day you know where you're going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;23;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;24;Therapist;What would it take to get you to a five in confidence, to feel more confident about getting work?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;25;Client;Being able to make the interviews would be the priority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;26;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;27;Client;Having childcare, having someone I trust that I can call when I know I have an interview.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;28;Therapist;You definitely need to go to an interview to get the job. Having reliable childcare would definitely help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;29;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;30;Therapist;What else would get you to a five?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;31;Client;I wish I had more experience or more education. Everyone seems to have a college education, and I don't have that on my resume.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;32;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;33;Client;I get asked about education and training, and as soon as I am, I feel like I'm not good enough since I don't have it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;34;Therapist;If you had something on your resume about education or training, maybe a certificate in a field you're interested in, you would feel proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;35;Client;Yeah. Something I could talk about in the interview. Even a certification where I could confidently talk about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;36;Therapist;Do you have any ideas what fields you might be interested in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;37;Client;I don't really know. I need a job now, so I'm not sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;38;Therapist;What's going to be fastest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;39;Client;Right. It's almost more important than what I'm interested in. I'm not going back to school for four years right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;40;Therapist;If you were going to do something, you'd want something quick, like a short certificate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;41;Client;Yeah, something that would get me immediate skills for some kind of job now, even if it's not my long-term goal. Just get me into something, and then I can focus on other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;42;Therapist;A short-term thing to transition into something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;43;Client;Yeah, exactly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;44;Therapist;That would be steady and pay well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;45;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;46;Therapist;Allow you to afford everything you need?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;47;Client;Yeah. Even those jobs don't feel accessible. It seems like maybe if I were better on the computer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;48;Therapist;Getting some computer skills would help?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;49;Client;Yeah. I think so because I don't have anything on my resume about technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;50;Therapist;So, getting a job is really important right now. You need the money and to take care of your children. You have some ideas about getting to interviews, and feeling more confident about your skills. Reliable childcare is very important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;51;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;52;Therapist;As well as maybe a certificate or classes in computers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;53;Client;Yeah, that would be great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;54;Therapist;What would you like to do next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;55;Client;Find childcare resources. That seems to be the priority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;56;Therapist;That's a priority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;57;Client;Because I can't even do an interview without that. And then, getting into some kind of short training program.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;58;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;high;managing life;59;Client;Like maybe a weekend program.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;0;Therapist;It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated with the cycle of losing and regaining weight.  It's completely understandable to feel that way.  Many people experience similar challenges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;1;Client;Yeah, it's just so discouraging. I feel like I'm constantly fighting a losing battle.  Work is crazy busy, and with the kids, I barely have time for myself, let alone trying to cook healthy meals or exercise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;2;Therapist;It sounds like you have a lot on your plate.  It's commendable that you're even thinking about your health amidst everything else.  It's not about being perfect, but about finding small, sustainable changes that can fit into your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;3;Client;That's what I keep hearing, but I honestly don't know where to start.  Everything feels overwhelming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;4;Therapist;Totally.  So, instead of trying to overhaul everything at once, how about we explore just one small area where you might be willing to make a change?  Something that feels manageable, even with your busy schedule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;5;Client;Hmm... I guess I could maybe try to be a little more active. I used to enjoy walking, but I haven't done it regularly in ages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;6;Therapist;Walking is fantastic!  It's accessible, and you can adjust the intensity and duration to fit your needs.  No need for a gym membership or special equipment.  Even short bursts of walking can be beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;7;Client;Yeah, I suppose I could try walking during my lunch break at work.  There's a park nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;8;Therapist;That's a great idea!  Even 15-20 minutes a few times a week can make a difference.  It's not about doing hours of intense exercise, but about incorporating movement into your day in a way that feels doable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;9;Client;Okay, I can try that.  But what about food?  That's where I really struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;10;Therapist;We can definitely talk about nutrition, but let's focus on the walking for now.  Making one change at a time can be more effective than trying to tackle everything at once.  Once you've established a walking routine, we can explore some small, manageable adjustments to your diet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;11;Client;That sounds much less daunting.  So, just the walking for now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;12;Therapist;Exactly.  Focus on finding a rhythm with the walking, and we'll check in next week to see how it's going.  We can then brainstorm some ideas for healthy eating that fit your lifestyle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;13;Client;Okay, I think I can do that.  Thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;high;diet and weight loss management;14;Therapist;You're welcome!  Remember, this is a journey, not a race.  Be patient with yourself, and celebrate the small victories along the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;0;Therapist;Welcome. My name is Mark, and I work here at Green Prescriptions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;1;Client;Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;2;Therapist;I know a little about you from the referral letter from your doctor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;3;Client;From my GP?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;4;Therapist;Yes, from your GP. But before we get to anything, I'd like to ask you a little about what led you to come here today and get an idea of what's been going on for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;5;Client;What's led me to come here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;6;Therapist;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;7;Client;My GP.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;8;Therapist;And what did he have to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;9;Client;Well, I had my checkup, and it revealed that apparently, I might have type 2 diabetes. That's what he says.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;10;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;11;Client;I think I feel perfectly well. I understand people with diabetes are a little plumper than I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;12;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;13;Client;But that's really why I'm here. I'm almost on his command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;14;Therapist;Right, so he gave you a directive?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;15;Client;Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;16;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;17;Client;But as I say, I feel absolutely fine now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;18;Therapist;So it came as a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;19;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;20;Therapist;You go for this checkup with the doctor, and he says, 'You have type 2 diabetes.';;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;21;Client;Mm, I was very surprised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;22;Therapist;Mm. Came out of the blue for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;23;Client;Yes, I think it did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;24;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;25;Client;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;26;Therapist;And you said you don't fit that type 2 diabetes image, that you've had this idea-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;27;Client;I-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;28;Therapist;of being overweight with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;29;Client;That's what I understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;30;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;31;Client;You know, and I'm not overweight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;32;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;33;Client;I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. But I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;34;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;35;Client;I don't know, really.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;36;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;37;Client;My lifestyle-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;38;Therapist;Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, type 2 diabetes and-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;39;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;40;Therapist;your lifestyle?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;41;Client;No, not at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;42;Therapist;Comes as a big surprise. What was your reaction when he told you that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;43;Client;Well, I thought he must be joking, to be honest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;44;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;45;Client;I thought, you know, why would you-- Look around you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;46;Therapist;Mm, mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;47;Client;I just felt that-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;48;Therapist;Yeah, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;49;Client;Right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;50;Therapist;He's got a lot to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;51;Client;Absolutely right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;52;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;53;Client;He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through, and I have these signs of diabetes 2.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;54;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;55;Client;Right? I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;56;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;57;Client;Um-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;58;Therapist;So how do you feel in your head-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;59;Client;I feel absolutely fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;60;Therapist;-and what the tests say kind of don't match up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;61;Client;Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;62;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;63;Client;I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;64;Therapist;Hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;65;Client;I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;66;Therapist;Hmm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;67;Client;I sort of, you know-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;68;Therapist;Hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;69;Client;I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;70;Therapist;Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;71;Client;What is the problem?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;72;Therapist;And how did this happen is probably what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;73;Client;Well, uh, yes. I mean-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;74;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;75;Client;-I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;76;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;77;Client;Um, but he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;78;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;79;Client;And I don't know if it's hereditary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;80;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;81;Client;I think he said something about it being hereditary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;82;Therapist;So he mentioned it might be a family thing, and so you-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;83;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;84;Therapist;maybe got it from your parents or something of the sort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;85;Client;Yeah, it could be-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;86;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;87;Client;-because my mother mentioned-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;88;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;89;Client;-that my father had diabetes-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;90;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;91;Client;-diabetes 2. And if I think about it, his brother-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;92;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;93;Client;-I haven't seen him for years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;94;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;95;Client;But he might well have it because he is-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;96;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;97;Client;-a pretty big guy. You know-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;98;Therapist;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;99;Client;He's pretty big.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;100;Therapist;So he fits the picture-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;101;Client;Well, yes, the stereotype-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;102;Therapist;-when you think about what he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;103;Client;Yeah, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;104;Therapist;A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that picture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;105;Client;Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;106;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;107;Client;-I don't know how many years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;108;Therapist;Mm. So you have this knowledge that there's some family history of diabetes in the past?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;109;Client;Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;110;Therapist;The doctor mentioned that as being a factor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;111;Client;Mm, I mean, is it hereditary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;112;Therapist;That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had it in the past, there is a hereditary or genetic factor involved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;113;Client;A genetic factor. So, does that mean that if you have a history of this in your family-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;114;Therapist;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;115;Client;-if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;116;Therapist;Correct. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;117;Client;Also, it's-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;118;Therapist;But it's not inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;119;Client;Right. Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;120;Therapist;Because the genes or the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it. So there are other factors that come into play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;121;Client;I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;122;Therapist;Well, you've mentioned some things you know, one being hereditary. What else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had much time to research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;123;Client;To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason to think about it. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;124;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;125;Client;The hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;126;Therapist;That makes sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;127;Client;And why go any further, it's there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;128;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;129;Client;Can't help it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;130;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;131;Client;They lived pretty long lives, they did, all right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;132;Therapist;They managed with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;133;Client;Relatively went into their 70s.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;134;Therapist;Okay. Would it be helpful if you knew a little more about the factors involved in type 2 diabetes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;135;Client;Well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;136;Therapist;If that would help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;137;Client;If there's something you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;138;Therapist;Well, I'll share what I know from working with others and some of my experiences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;139;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;high;diabetes management;140;Therapist;And see what you make of it. See if it fits with where you're at. We know there's a strong family or hereditary factor. It tends to happen later in life, not when you're a teenager. So it's a later onset. It takes time to develop. The main aspect is insulin. Have you heard of it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;0;Client;Well, I'm here because my mom wants me to be here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;1;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;2;Client;I don't really wanna be here, but it-it-- whatever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;3;Therapist;Got it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;4;Client;Um, she-she found my stash-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;5;Therapist;Uh-huh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;6;Client;-and she freaked out, and she's going crazy over it. Um, I don't know why she was going through my stuff in the first place, but whatever, so, now I'm here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;7;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;8;Client;Um, I've been hanging out with a new cool crowd of people that I really like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;9;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;10;Client;And that's basically it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;11;Therapist;Yeah. So you've got this new group of friends and, um, you actually kind of like where you're at with things right now. And your mom was going through your stuff and found your stash, and it's just turned into this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;12;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;13;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;14;Client;Yeah, basically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;15;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;16;Client;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;17;Therapist;And, uh, sounds like you're pretty upset with your mom for doing that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;18;Client;I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;19;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;20;Client;I mean, it's my stuff, I don't know why she's-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;21;Therapist;Right. It's like your private space and, you know, it's-- that's-- it's your stuff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;22;Client;I-I don't go- I don't go through her stuff. I don't go through her purse. I don't-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;23;Therapist;Yeah. So why should she go through yours?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;24;Client;Right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;high;unidentifiable;25;Therapist;Yeah. Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Okay, I've finished the exam. I have some good news and some not-so-good news. Looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the good news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;1;Client;That's great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;However, I'm a bit concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. If you look up here, at the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing some irritation that's often associated with tobacco use. You mentioned on your form that you don't use tobacco, so I'm wondering what might be contributing to this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;3;Client;I don't smoke cigarettes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;Okay. Well, as I said, there's some irritation, particularly on the roof of your mouth. It's a bit discolored and there are some small red spots. You probably haven't noticed, as we don't often look at the roof of our mouths, but this could be damaging the tissue and potentially cause some oral health problems. It's sometimes called nicotinic stomatitis. We typically see this in patients who use tobacco. So, perhaps you're not smoking cigarettes, but are you using a pipe or cigars, or is there anything else that could be contributing to this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;5;Client;Well, the only thing is... I've never smoked cigarettes, but when I go out with friends, we sometimes go to lounges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;Mm-hmm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;7;Client;And, you know, sometimes there are people who offer us these little cigars, like Swisher Sweets. They come in different flavors. That's the only time I ever really use anything with tobacco in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;Okay, so it sounds like you might be referring to flavored mini cigars. It's a common misconception that because they're flavored, they're not as harmful.  Did you know they still carry similar risks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;9;Client;Really?  They're just small, flavored cigars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;They are still cigars, and they still contain tobacco.  They carry similar risks to cigarettes, including the potential for oral cancer and other health issues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;11;Client;Well, I only use them when I'm out socializing. It's not like I smoke regularly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;I understand. It's good that it's not a daily habit, but even occasional use can still cause problems.  I can see some changes in your mouth that suggest some damage is occurring. Have you considered quitting altogether?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;13;Client;Well, I didn't really think I had started a habit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;What do you mean?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;15;Client;I didn't really think of it as anything more than just something I do socially, like having a drink with friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;So, what are your thoughts about quitting?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;17;Client;Maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;I understand it's something to think about.  Given what we've discussed about the potential risks, what makes you hesitate about quitting completely?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;19;Client;Well, it's just something I do to relax when I'm out, and it's not very often. I could probably cut back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;Cutting back is a good thought, and it can be a helpful first step. However, complete cessation is the most effective way to reverse the changes in your mouth and eliminate the risks associated with tobacco use.  What are your thoughts about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;21;Client;Well, I'm not sure they are really cigars. And I feel it's my choice what I do, and I'll think about cutting back, but I'm not ready to quit completely right now. I'm also not completely convinced about the risks you're describing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;I understand your perspective. It's important to have all the information to make informed choices. The changes I'm seeing in your mouth are consistent with what we see with tobacco use, regardless of the form.  It can affect your teeth and overall oral health.  It's a decision you're making about your health, and even occasional use can pose risks.  What would help you feel more confident about the information I'm sharing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;23;Client;I'm not sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;That's okay. I'm here to support you in any way I can.  Perhaps we could discuss some resources that provide more information about the risks of tobacco use, even occasional use.  Would that be something you'd be open to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;25;Client;Maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;Okay.  I appreciate you considering this.  I'll check in with you at your next visit to see how you're doing and if you have any further questions or concerns.  In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;27;Client;No, I think that's all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;low;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;Okay.  Thanks for coming in today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;0;Client;The baby was up all night and I'm exhausted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;1;Therapist;That sounds incredibly tough.  Lack of sleep can really take a toll.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;2;Client;Yes. She was up every three hours to eat, I don't understand it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;3;Therapist;It's completely understandable to feel that way.  Caring for a newborn is demanding, and the sleep deprivation can be overwhelming.  It's common for babies at this age to still be feeding frequently throughout the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;4;Client;Yes. My mom told me that I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;5;Therapist;It sounds like you're comparing Lilly's sleep patterns to your own as a baby. It's important to remember that every baby is different, and what was true for one baby isn't necessarily true for another.  Developmental milestones, including sleep patterns, vary widely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;6;Client;Well, what is normal for a baby this age?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;7;Therapist;That's a great question.  At six weeks, it's very common for babies to still be waking up frequently throughout the night to feed.  Their little stomachs are small, and breast milk and formula are digested quickly.  Also, their sleep cycles are different from adults.  They spend less time in deep sleep and more time in lighter sleep, which makes them more prone to waking.  While some babies might start sleeping longer stretches earlier, it's also perfectly normal for them to still be waking every few hours at this stage.  There's a wide range of what's considered 'normal'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;8;Client;So, it's not unusual that she's still waking up every three hours?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;9;Therapist;Absolutely not.  It's very typical.  Many parents experience similar challenges.  It's understandable to feel frustrated when you're exhausted, but it's important to remember that you're not alone in this, and Lilly's sleep patterns are likely to change and evolve as she gets older.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;10;Client;Okay.  I guess I was just hoping for more sleep by now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;11;Therapist;It's perfectly natural to hope for more sleep.  Sleep deprivation is incredibly challenging.  What are some things you've tried so far to manage the nighttime feedings and get some rest yourself?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;12;Client;Well, I'm breastfeeding, so my husband can't really help at night.  And I've tried putting her down in her crib when she's drowsy, but she usually wakes right back up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;13;Therapist;It sounds like you're doing your best to manage the situation. Breastfeeding is wonderful for both you and Lilly, but it can be more demanding in terms of nighttime feedings, especially in the early weeks.  Have you considered talking to a lactation consultant about strategies for managing nighttime feedings and maximizing rest? They might have some helpful suggestions tailored to your situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;14;Client;No, I haven't. I didn't think of that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;15;Therapist;It could be a valuable resource.  They can offer support and guidance on breastfeeding techniques, optimizing feeding schedules, and even discuss strategies for partners to be more involved, even if they aren't breastfeeding directly.  They can also validate your experience and help you feel more confident in your approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;16;Client;That sounds helpful. I think I will look into that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;17;Therapist;That's a great idea.  Remember, taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of Lilly.  Prioritizing your well-being, even with limited sleep, can make a big difference in how you're able to cope with the demands of parenthood.  We can also talk more about other strategies for managing sleep deprivation and finding support if you'd like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;high;unidentifiable;18;Client;Yes, that would be great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;Therapist;Hello, Kaylie. I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by Dr. Ferris today. I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;Client;Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;Therapist;Okay. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;Client;Well, he told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol, and that I should start taking this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;Therapist;He's right. This medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;Client;He didn't really tell me. He just phoned it in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;Therapist;Okay. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you normally take your medications?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;7;Client;Well, I take all of my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;8;Therapist;Okay. That's perfect because cholesterol statin works best if it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should take it every single day. It's important to keep that up. Where do you store your medications?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;9;Client;I store my medications, uh, in my nightstand, right by my bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;10;Therapist;All right. Do you have any children in your home?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;11;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;12;Therapist;Okay. Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;13;Client;He didn't mention anything about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;14;Therapist;All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;15;Therapist;Just so I know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;16;Client;Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications. And I guess I will switched to orange juice. And if I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I'll call Dr. Ferris right away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;17;Therapist;Great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What other questions do you have for me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;18;Client;Uh, I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;low;adhering to medical procedure;19;Therapist;Fantastic. All right. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every- at the same time every month. And if you have any other questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;0;Therapist;Good morning. It's really nice that you've come to see me to talk about stopping smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;1;Client;Good morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;2;Therapist;What brings you in today? What are you hoping to achieve?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;3;Client;Well, I'd like some medication if you can offer me some.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;4;Therapist;Absolutely, we can discuss medication options.  What else are you hoping to gain from our sessions?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;5;Client;Just whatever else you can do to help me become smoke-free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;6;Therapist;Okay. Can you tell me more about why you want to quit smoking?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;7;Client;Well, these days I'm finding that I'm smoking 20 to 30 a day, and I'm getting sick of it.  I've seen my friends stop smoking, and it feels like I'm the only one left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;8;Therapist;It sounds like you're feeling some pressure to quit, especially when you're around your friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;9;Client;Especially the other night at the restaurant. It was a bit embarrassing being the only one walking outside to smoke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;10;Therapist;So, feeling a little uncomfortable and self-conscious is one of the reasons you want to quit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;11;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;12;Therapist;Are there any other reasons?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;13;Client;It's expensive these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;14;Therapist;How much are you spending a week, roughly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;15;Client;About £7 a day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;16;Therapist;So, about £50 a week?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;17;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;18;Therapist;So, we have the cost, feeling like the odd one out, and not liking the smell. Those seem like three good reasons to consider quitting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;19;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;20;Therapist;Do you feel like those reasons are strong enough to motivate you to quit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;21;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;22;Therapist;Great. Have you thought about when you'd like to quit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;23;Client;What do you suggest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;24;Therapist;It often works best to pick a time when you're not under too much other stress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;25;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;26;Therapist;What do you enjoy most about smoking?  What are the main reasons you smoke?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;27;Client;It's just something to do. When I'm bored, I smoke. Or sometimes when I go out, but as I said, I'm often the only one outside smoking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;28;Therapist;Okay. What do you think you'll miss the most about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;29;Client;It helps me with stress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;30;Therapist;What kind of stress?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;31;Client;Just when I take a break at work. I need a break away from it all, just to shut off. The cigarette helps me calm down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;32;Therapist;So, it's a way to de-stress and take a break.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;33;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;34;Therapist;What's your favorite cigarette of the day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;35;Client;Definitely the one at the end of the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;36;Therapist;The one that helps you unwind and transition to your personal time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;37;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;38;Therapist;After you set a quit date, what do you think you might do at the end of the workday, when you'd normally have that cigarette?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;39;Client;I guess I'll just get some fresh air, but without a cigarette. I'll try to give myself regular breaks, maybe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;40;Therapist;It sounds like you're already thinking about alternative strategies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;41;Client;It's going to be tough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;42;Therapist;Have you tried to quit before?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;43;Client;I managed a couple of weeks once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;44;Therapist;What led you to start smoking again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;45;Client;It was stress from an argument with my partner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;46;Therapist;So, a stressful situation triggered you to start again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;47;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;48;Therapist;Let me summarize. You want to quit because of the cost, feeling left out, and the smell. You smoke mainly to relax and de-stress, especially at the end of the day.  You'd like to quit, and you want to choose a time when you're under less stress.  Is that a fair summary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;49;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;50;Therapist;When do you think might be a good time to set your quit date?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;51;Client;I have a party this weekend. Maybe Monday morning after that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;52;Therapist;So, Monday morning after the party. That's next week. Okay. We often recommend medication to help people quit.  It can increase your chances of success and help manage cravings.  Have you considered any medication options?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;53;Client;Yes. I'm thinking about the patches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;54;Therapist;Okay. You've seen the patches before?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;55;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;56;Therapist;We can discuss how to use them.  The course usually lasts 10 to 12 weeks, and we recommend completing the whole course for the best chance of success. You mentioned that the end of the workday is a particularly challenging time.  Sometimes using two different types of nicotine replacement can be helpful.  For example, you could use a patch for a steady dose of nicotine and then have something else available for when cravings get strong.  What does a craving feel like for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;57;Client;I just get irritable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;58;Therapist;That's a common nicotine withdrawal symptom.  The patch can help with that baseline irritability, and then we can talk about a second product you can use when those breakthrough cravings hit, especially in the first week.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;59;Client;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;60;Therapist;So, you're happy with Monday as your quit date?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;61;Client;Yes, absolutely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;62;Therapist;Would you like to schedule a follow-up appointment?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;63;Client;Yes, definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;64;Therapist;Would it be alright if I gave you a call if you don't make it to the appointment?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;low;smoking cessation;65;Client;Yes, that would be great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;0;Therapist;Hello, Mr. Green. It's good to see you again.  Last week we reviewed your results, and you have impaired glucose tolerance, slightly elevated blood pressure, and cholesterol.  Today, we'll discuss lifestyle changes that can improve your health. How have you been?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;1;Client;Well, I suppose you're going to tell me it's all my fault and I have to give up everything I enjoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;2;Therapist;Not at all. You're in charge of your health.  My role is to support you in making informed decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;3;Client;The doctor said I might need medication long-term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;4;Therapist;That sounds concerning. How do you feel about that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;5;Client;I feel fine, but the doctor said it could be beneficial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;6;Therapist;There are many things you can do to improve your health, often working in conjunction with medication. Today, we can explore options like diet, exercise, and weight management. Where would you like to begin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;7;Client;Okay, what should I do first?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;8;Therapist;It's entirely up to you.  Where do *you* think you should start?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;9;Client;What do *you* think?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;10;Therapist;I can offer suggestions, but you already have a good understanding of what's beneficial.  What comes to mind for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;11;Client;You'll probably say stop smoking, lose weight, and exercise more, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;12;Therapist;Those are all excellent points.  Quitting smoking would have a significant positive impact, and weight loss would help with blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes risk. What are your thoughts on those?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;13;Client;I'd love to lose weight, but it's hard to give up the things I enjoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;14;Therapist;It's understandable that change is difficult. Where do you see yourself in terms of making these changes?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;15;Client;I want to be there for my children and grandchildren, and be a good example. I don't want to be a burden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;16;Therapist;So, your family is a strong motivator for you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;17;Client;Yes. I want to be healthy for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;18;Therapist;Where do you think you could start?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;19;Client;I've been thinking about it. I could cut back on my drinking. That contributes to my weight and blood pressure, doesn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;20;Therapist;Absolutely, that's a great starting point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;21;Client;Actually, I think I'll try to cut it out completely. My wife says I drink too much on weekends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;22;Therapist;That sounds like a positive step, and it's great that you have support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;23;Client;And I suppose I could cut out the snacks at work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;24;Therapist;What could you replace them with to avoid getting hungry?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;25;Client;I'll have soup at lunchtime. A big bowl of soup is better than the snacks I usually have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;26;Therapist;That's a fantastic idea. Vegetable soup can count towards your daily servings of fruits and vegetables. What else have you considered?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;27;Client;I've already stopped adding salt to my food. The doctor said it would help my blood pressure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;28;Therapist;That's excellent!  Reducing salt intake also benefits bone health by helping retain calcium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;29;Client;I didn't know that! I'll tell my wife. She uses a lot of salt, and her mother had osteoporosis.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;30;Therapist;That's a great way to support her too. You've made a wonderful start, Mr. Green. You're clearly motivated and have a good plan. You're reducing alcohol, cutting back on snacks, and have already reduced salt.  Next time, we can discuss smoking and exercise further, when you're ready. How do you feel about your progress so far?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;31;Client;I feel good about cutting back on snacks and alcohol. I'm taking it one step at a time. Hopefully, my next check-up will show improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;32;Therapist;That's a great attitude.  Shall we schedule our next appointment for the same time next week?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;33;Client;Yes, that works for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;34;Therapist;Excellent. I look forward to seeing you then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;high;diabetes management;35;Client;Thanks. You too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;0;Therapist;Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;1;Client;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;2;Therapist;Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I want to talk about that and I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may want to change in your life because we're going to be working together for a while here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;3;Client;Right. Neat. What have I changed, what am I—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;4;Therapist;What you've been thinking about over the last little while about getting your life back on track. Because I noticed you've—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;5;Client;I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;6;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;7;Client;I mean, I've been thinking about how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;8;Therapist;Sure. So what I'm picking up is that's a life that you know a lot about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;9;Client;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;10;Therapist;And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, maybe life can be different. So I'm wondering where you're at with the kind of thinking about—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;11;Client;Well, at the end of that last week inside, I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;12;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;13;Client;I don't have—I don't know what that is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;14;Therapist;Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;15;Client;Yes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;16;Therapist;—the expectation of life on the inside something?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;17;Client;Yeah, it's worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;18;Therapist;Yeah?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;19;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;20;Therapist;So tell me how you've been managing. Because I don't know if you've been back dealing? How have you been managing to—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;21;Client;I haven't yet, I mean—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;22;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;23;Client;—the offer's there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;24;Therapist;Yeah?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;25;Client;Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;26;Therapist;Tell me—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;27;Client;—it's there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;28;Therapist;It's there and—and—and you've a lot of contacts?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;29;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;30;Therapist;You've been in the system, so lots of contacts. So this isn't a new challenge for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;31;Client;No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;32;Therapist;So what stopped you over the last—How long have you been out now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;33;Client;How long have I been out?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;34;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;35;Client;Three weeks, one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;36;Therapist;Three weeks, isn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;37;Client;Three weeks, one day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;38;Therapist;So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;39;Client;I don't know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;40;Therapist;22 days you've actually made a decision not to—to pick up your old life and continue on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;41;Client;Um, I—I—you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. I don't know, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't—I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;42;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;43;Client;And I—I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;44;Therapist;Right. So the one hand you've—you—you could set yourself up and—and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;45;Client;No, never lasts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;46;Therapist;Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;47;Client;Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;48;Therapist;Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;49;Client;Yeah. And—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;50;Therapist;Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;51;Client;—sort of opposite, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;52;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;53;Client;You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;54;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;55;Client;But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;56;Therapist;Okay. Okay. So—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;57;Client;Do you have an idea?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;58;Therapist;No. Well, I've—I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;59;Client;Mm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;60;Therapist;But I guess what I'm really interested in is—is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;61;Client;Fiona?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;62;Therapist;Yeah?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;63;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;64;Therapist;Tell me about Fiona?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;65;Client;She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she—What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the stuff. And I owe her—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;66;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;67;Client;something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;68;Therapist;Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;69;Client;12 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;70;Therapist;12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;71;Client;Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;72;Therapist;Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;73;Client;It's pretty she—you know, she could be pretty full-on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;74;Therapist;Yeah, yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;75;Client;Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;76;Therapist;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;77;Client;I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;78;Therapist;Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;79;Client;Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;80;Therapist;Okay. So what's Fiona want from you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;81;Client;She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She—she remembers me and she wants—she wants him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;82;Therapist;She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;83;Client;The one that, you know—;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;84;Therapist;Does she want the—did she want the—the—the—the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;85;Client;Yeah, that's the one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;86;Therapist;Or does she want the—the—the—the him that's—that keeps on getting into trouble?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;87;Client;No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;88;Therapist;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;89;Client;Yeah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;90;Therapist;So what's it going to take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;high;reducing recidivism;91;Client;If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
