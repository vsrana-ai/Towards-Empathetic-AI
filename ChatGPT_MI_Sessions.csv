3;high;0;therapist;Thanks for coming in today. Can you tell me a bit about what brought you here?
3;high;1;client;My wife’s been really on me lately about my health. I don’t see it as a big issue, honestly.
3;high;2;therapist;It sounds like you feel you're managing fine, even though your wife is concerned?
3;high;3;client;Yeah, I work hard, long hours. I don’t always eat at home, but it’s not like I’m eating horribly.
3;high;4;therapist;So your job demands a lot from you, and eating out is more about convenience than neglect?
3;high;5;client;Exactly. I’m not gaining tons of weight or anything. I stay active during work.
3;high;6;therapist;You’re physically active and not seeing immediate health issues, which reassures you.
3;high;7;client;Yeah. I had a check-up last year and everything seemed fine.
3;high;8;therapist;That’s good to hear. Still, your wife’s concern shows how much she cares.
3;high;9;client;I get that. She just wants me around long-term, you know?
3;high;10;therapist;It sounds like her love for you comes out as concern about your habits.
3;high;11;client;Yeah. I guess I could try to do better… just not sure where to start.
3;high;12;therapist;Would it be okay if I shared some small steps that could fit into your lifestyle?
3;high;13;client;Sure, I’m open to ideas.
4;high;0;therapist;Hi Emily, it’s good to see you again. I noticed something new today!
4;high;1;client;Yeah, I got my lip pierced a few weeks ago.
4;high;2;therapist;It’s definitely a bold change. What made you decide to do it?
4;high;3;client;I just wanted something different. I like standing out.
4;high;4;therapist;So it was about self-expression and doing something fresh.
4;high;5;client;Yeah, exactly.
4;high;6;therapist;I appreciate you sharing that. As your dentist, I do have a couple of concerns about oral piercings. Have you heard anything about their effects on teeth or gums?
4;high;7;client;Not much. I mean, I guess it could press on my gums, but I don’t know how bad that is.
4;high;8;therapist;That’s fair. In some cases, I’ve seen gum recession and chipped teeth from the jewelry. Has anything like that shown up for you?
4;high;9;client;Not really, but I do have low gums already. And flossing… well, I know I should do it more.
4;high;10;therapist;It sounds like you’re aware, and it’s on your radar even if it’s not a habit yet.
4;high;11;client;Yeah, I don’t want to damage my teeth. They’ve always been good.
4;high;12;therapist;Absolutely. You said something important — the piercing might be temporary, but your teeth are for life.
4;high;13;client;That’s true. I guess if I start to notice problems, I’ll reconsider.
4;high;14;therapist;Would you be open to keeping an eye on things together at each visit?
4;high;15;client;Yeah, that sounds good.
6;high;0;therapist;Hi, sal. thanks for coming in today.
6;high;1;client;No problem.
6;high;2;therapist;I saw that your doctor made the referral and, um, and i really appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment.
6;high;3;client;Yeah, it's-it's a bit of an inconvenience i'd say, but i'm here though.
6;high;4;therapist;So you made it in here-
6;high;5;client;Mm-hmm.
6;high;6;therapist;- and do you have a sense of-of what some of the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?
6;high;7;client;I don't know, something about changing my life even more. you know, the smoking's been changed, and now it's, you know, cut down the drinking, get rid of those extra smokes, get rid of my dog. i don't know what else have to do.
6;high;8;therapist;So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?
6;high;9;client;Yeah, there's a lot of stress too. my wife's still on maternity leave, she's not getting paid, she's with the baby right now. and i'm the only person that's working right now, and plus i got to change all these things that are going on in my life.
6;high;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. almost—
6;high;11;client;Yeah, it's a lot.
6;high;12;therapist;Almost overwhelming it sounds like.
6;high;13;client;Yeah, yeah, it is overwhelming. it is.
6;high;14;therapist;Well, we have about, i guess, 15 or 20 minutes together and i wonder, would it be okay, if we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different things that are going on for you and maybe you can let me know, what would be the most helpful to spend-spend some time on?
6;high;15;client;Yeah, it just feels like everything's all over the place but i guess we got to start somewhere.
6;high;16;therapist;Okay. well, one of the things that-that we use are these-- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically.
6;high;17;client;Mm-hmm.
6;high;18;therapist;So if you were to-to list all of the different things that people around you are saying that you need to work on or you need to change, what would some of those things be? and, sal, just because we write them down here, it doesn't mean that you have to change them.
6;high;19;client;Okay.
6;high;20;therapist;It really-- you're in the driver's seat, so it's just to kind of put all the cards on the table, so to speak.
6;high;21;client;Okay. um, okay, that sounds good. as long as i'm not changing anything and we're just kind of putting, um, i guess, pen to paper or something.
6;high;22;therapist;Yep.
6;high;23;client;Um, okay, so my asthma.
6;high;24;therapist;Okay, so asthma is one.
6;high;25;client;Yeah.
6;high;26;therapist;What else?
6;high;27;client;Um, the fact that they want me to get rid of oscar, that's-that's my dog.
6;high;28;therapist;So your dog, and-and the doctor's saying the dog's—
6;high;29;client;Well, he's-- yeah, he's saying it's a main-- it's a main contributor to my asthma problems.
6;high;30;therapist;Okay.
7;high;0;therapist;So i know we've determined that you sprained your ankle yesterday and i'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit about how that happened?
7;high;1;client;Um, it's really stupid. uh, i was at a pub crawl last night and you know how pub crawls are. you have a few drinks and then i thought it was a really good idea to catch up with my friends who are, yeah, they're in front of me. so i just like jumped off the stairs of the bus and i was wearing these like stilettos 'cause it was a 90s-themed pub crawl. anyway, and then i just like fell on my ankle. it was really embarrassing.
7;high;2;therapist;Sounds like a wild night.
7;high;3;client;Yeah.
7;high;4;therapist;Yeah.
7;high;5;client;It was a lot of fun but i didn't do any dancing after that.
7;high;6;therapist;No, i guess that that would be the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. i know-- i wonder if you'd be open to exploring your alcohol use and what that looks like during the week.
7;high;7;client;Uh, sure, uh, as long as we don't talk too much about like vodka 'cause i'm still, ugh, a little—
7;high;8;therapist;You're still feeling the effects of-
7;high;9;client;Yeah.
7;high;10;therapist;-last night, are you?
7;high;11;client;A little bit.
7;high;12;therapist;Oh wow, it was-
7;high;13;client;Yeah.
7;high;14;therapist;Really a rough night.
7;high;15;client;Well, it's normal.
7;high;16;therapist;So what is a typical week for you as far as your alcohol use?
7;high;17;client;Um, well, me and my friends kinda, uh, we party on the weekend and, you know, we're all university students and so it's just normal, um, to have a few drinks.
7;high;18;therapist;So a few drinks is nothing new to you?
7;high;19;client;No.
7;high;20;therapist;And what does a few drinks look like? is that per night? is it two drinks?
7;high;21;client;Um, per night, uh, like if we go out oh, it's a lot. it's like i can drink probably like seven or eight drinks like if i'm going hard. um, and then, you know, like maybe when i get home from school, a long day at the library, have a beer or two, so.
7;high;22;therapist;All right. do you have any concerns at all about your alcohol use?
7;high;23;client;No. i-i don't know. it's normal for university students i feel.
7;high;24;therapist;Okay, so at this point, you're not too concerned and you think that, you know, this is what the other students are doing?
7;high;25;client;Yeah.
7;high;26;therapist;Would you be open to kind of looking at the low-risk drinking alcohol guidelines?
7;high;27;client;Yeah, sure.
7;high;28;therapist;I don't know how you're feeling right now but i'm just wondering if we can take a-just a quick glance at this-
7;high;29;client;Yeah.
7;high;30;therapist;-and what the safe limits are for women is 10 drinks for women a week with about two drinks, uh, per day.
7;high;31;client;Oh really?
7;high;32;therapist;Yeah.
7;high;33;client;Wow.
7;high;34;therapist;Where do you- where do you feel you fall into that?
7;high;35;client;Uh, uh i would say a little over that.
7;high;36;therapist;Okay, okay.
7;high;37;client;Especially with midterms coming up.
7;high;38;therapist;Okay, so it's kind of a way to cope through stress?
8;high;0;therapist;So, what brings you here, bob? what's, what can i do to help?
8;high;1;client;Yeah. yeah, well, the only reason i'm here is 'cause my wife thinks i've got a problem with smoking. i've been smoking all my life and, uh, six months ago, uh, she thought, she got into this health kick, right? and now everyone who smokes is evil. and, uh, so that's why i'm here just to please her, get her off my back and—
8;high;2;therapist;So, you're not too happy to be here. this is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon.
8;high;3;client;Yeah. that's an understatement. i mean, i'm supposed to be at work right now, too, right? so-
8;high;4;therapist;You've taken time off you, it's costing you time and money being here.
8;high;5;client;Yeah, yeah. i'm only here because my wife forced me to come, you know. like this has come to a head six months of just nagging me, relentless every day, because she was able to quit smoking and now i have to quit.
8;high;6;therapist;So, let me ask you this, bob, what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?
8;high;7;client;Well, she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles from the paper about second-hand smoke and—
8;high;8;therapist;Wow, that she's been showing you and making you read.
8;high;9;client;Yeah, i've got to read this. that's my reading assignment for breakfast and i want to go out and have-- we used to go out and have a cigarette together at the table. now i have to go outside in this weather, you know, what's that about? and she used to smoke more than me and now she's like holier than now?
8;high;10;therapist;So, you're pretty angry about it. it's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago.
8;high;11;client;And she's got my kids on this against me, you know, my son and my daughter, they're, it's like, they're ganging up on me, you know what i mean?
8;high;12;therapist;So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?
8;high;13;client;Well, the big one of course is how it's affecting my wife and the family. like my dad's 85, he still smokes. i mean, yeah, you know, sometimes i thought of quitting, but i mean, i don't know. i don't know if i can-- i don't know if i can quit.
8;high;14;therapist;So, let me make sure i understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a lot of pieces to it. your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. so, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter.
8;high;15;client;Yeah.
8;high;16;therapist;You have a few concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. it sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore. does that pretty much sum up--?
8;high;17;client;Yeah. yeah. i-i'm just, i don't want to lose her or my family over smoking.
10;low;0;therapist;Hi. you are [unintelligible 00:00:02]?
10;low;1;client;Yeah.
10;low;2;therapist;Okay. um, what brings you in?
10;low;3;client;Well, i'm supposed to come to learn about my-- how to manage my diabetes. just got diagnosed.
10;low;4;therapist;Mm-hmm. i see- i see that your a1c or your blood glucose is very high.
10;low;5;client;Yeah, that's what doctor said. she-she really laid into me about that. said it was-- i guess, this is really serious stuff. she was talking about losing eyesight, mm, my feet, mm, problems with a lot of other stuff, and it really scared me. uh, so, [sighs] you know, how-how-how to manage all this, i guess, is what i gotta learn, but it just sounds massive.
10;low;6;therapist;Mm-hmm. well, you do need to take your medicine. we, uh, will need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change-change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control, because your doctor is right, it is very serious.
11;high;0;therapist;What else has brought you here?
11;high;1;client;They found a little bag of weed.
11;high;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.
11;high;3;client;It's not a lot though.
11;high;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.
11;high;5;client;It's not like i was gonna sell it or anything. it's like—
11;high;6;therapist;Just enough for your own use?
11;high;7;client;Yeah, whatever, you know. it's california, no one cares.
11;high;8;therapist;Yeah. yeah. yeah.
12;high;0;therapist;Sarah, i'm so glad you came in for your well-woman exam today. i think we addressed a lot of your concerns. however, i would like to ask you more about your smoking. would that be okay?
12;high;1;client;Yeah, i guess.
12;high;2;therapist;Okay. so about how much are you smoking over the course of a day? you had said it had increased over once or twice a day.
12;high;3;client;Yeah, um, normally, i'm smoking, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch break and then in the evening maybe like five or six.
12;high;4;therapist;Okay. so about eight cigarettes. so over the course of a day, just under half a pack?
12;high;5;client;Yeah.
12;high;6;therapist;Okay. and that's changed over what period of time?
12;high;7;client;Um, honestly, it's probably been over the past year or so that i- i've been smoking a little bit more.
12;high;8;therapist;Okay. so over the past year, the smoking has increased. and that's been mainly in the evening?
12;high;9;client;Yeah. um, i have a two-year-old son as i mentioned, so i try to never smoke around him. so i'm normally kinda waiting until he gets to bed.
12;high;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind.
12;high;11;client;Yeah, exactly. you know, i told you, my-my schedule is kinda crazy right now. i, um, i work full-time and i just started back at night classes. so, you know, all that combined, you know, i enjoy that time to myself in the evening.
12;high;12;therapist;Sure. sure. well, it's a time to relax and you've got a lot going on.
12;high;13;client;Mm-hmm.
12;high;14;therapist;So are there other things you do in the evening to relax?
12;high;15;client;Um, i mean, maybe i'll have like a drink or two.
12;high;16;therapist;Okay. a drink or two. so about how many drinks would you say you have over the course of a day?
12;high;17;client;Um, maybe like two max.
12;high;18;therapist;Two max. how many drinks would you say you'd have over the course of a week?
12;high;19;client;I don't know. i mean, i don't really get why you're asking me that. i mean, i just came here, you know, for a regular visit. i-i am not here to talk about my drinking.
12;high;20;therapist;No, i understand- i understand. and i'm certainly not here to tell you what to-to do, sarah. i'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some information with you, and what you do with that information is totally up to you. you've got a lot going on. you're a mother, you're working, you're going to school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the resources available to you to meet your goals, including good health. and my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share information with you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and alcohol. would that be okay with you?
12;high;21;client;Yeah, i guess.
12;high;22;therapist;Okay. well, we do know that an increase in smoking and alcohol is associated with certain kinds of cancer
12;high;23;client;Yeah.
12;high;24;therapist;-interested in what your thoughts are, sarah.
12;high;25;client;Well, i-i'm just kinda surprised because, i mean, i don't smoke or drink that much. and i mean, compared to people i work with, you know, i-i smoke a lot less, and i feel like i've actually been trying to keep it pretty low.
12;high;26;therapist;So you're consciously trying to cut back.
12;high;27;client;Yeah.
12;high;28;therapist;I have a readiness ruler in my pocket here, 0 means not ready to stop smoking at all and 10 means absolutely ready to stop smoking. where do you see yourself on that scale?
12;high;29;client;Um, maybe like a five.
12;high;30;therapist;About a five. so you're halfway there. so why did you choose a five rather than a four?
13;high;0;therapist;Hi, mrs. smith. i wanted to let you know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving lilly some vaccines.
13;high;1;client;Oh, i-i don't know if i'm comfortable with that. i've been reading a bunch of stuff lately about them.
13;high;2;therapist;Hmm. can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?
13;high;3;client;Uh, yeah, well, i was just- i was reading that it's better to let them build up their immunity, like, naturally and stuff in their immune systems.
13;high;4;therapist;Okay, so you were thinking that maybe exposing lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her get stronger?
13;high;5;client;Well, yeah. i mean, i had chickenpox as a kid, and now i'm immune. right? so.
13;high;6;therapist;That's right. having chickenpox as a child means that you are less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a-a natural immunity. uh, but is it okay if i offer you a little bit more information about the other vaccines that we're- we were going to give her lily today?
13;high;7;client;Uh, okay.
14;high;0;therapist;So, again, i hear your overall goal is really, to not give up these things you'd like but to cut back on how much you have-
14;high;1;client;Yeah, i guess so.
14;high;2;therapist;-on that. all right. so, i'd like to ask you, uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause i'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance.
14;high;3;client;Yeah.
14;high;4;therapist;"So, i'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, ""i'm very, very confident,"" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?"
14;high;5;client;Right now, i'm probably-
14;high;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.
14;high;7;client;Gonna say a six.
14;high;8;therapist;A six.
14;high;9;client;But i know when i go home and i see the food, it's probably gonna drop back down to a four.
14;high;10;therapist;Okay. all right. so, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a four.
14;high;11;client;Right?
14;high;12;therapist;Okay?
14;high;13;client;I guess.
14;high;14;therapist;So, why are you at a four and not even a lower number? why are you not like a zero or a one?
14;high;15;client;Because i've been wanting to do this for-for years, like-
14;high;16;therapist;Okay.
14;high;17;client;Ever since i started becoming conscious of my body.
14;high;18;therapist;Okay.
14;high;19;client;Like ever since i started being a teen, like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially 'cause all my friends play soccer, and like-
14;high;20;therapist;Uh-huh.
14;high;21;client;-hike, and are like super stick-thin but really healthy and active.
14;high;22;therapist;Okay.
14;high;23;client;And so i'm just sort of like, well, i'm not.
14;high;24;therapist;Okay.
14;high;25;client;But i want to be like-- i don't want to be like stick-thin, but i really want to be like really healthy and really active.
14;high;26;therapist;Okay.
14;high;27;client;And like be able to look nice, you know.
14;high;28;therapist;Okay, all right.
16;high;0;therapist;So, rick, just in regards to your flatmate situation at the moment with tristan. uh, you know, we talked about how walking through this program and with the support of your parents and having some positive influence to help you through this. i just want to rethink a bit if you stay living with tristan. what are the sort of pros and cons of that? what are the good things about living there, what are the not-so-good things about living there?
16;high;1;client;Oh, it's a nice place. it's close to work. it's good living with a mate.
16;high;2;therapist;Yeah. so, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these changes.
16;high;3;client;Yeah.
16;high;4;therapist;What's your thinking around that?
16;high;5;client;That's the thing, isn't it? i am-- i don't know if it's the best place for me to be if i'm gonna make those changes.
16;high;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.
16;high;7;client;And tristan is a good flatmate.
16;high;8;therapist;Yeah.
16;high;9;client;I have no-- we're going in different-different directions now. he doesn't have the same kind of responsibilities i have and stuff, and so-- and i can't expect him to change his whole life around, just because i wanna change mine.
16;high;10;therapist;Right.
16;high;11;client;I just-- i don't know how keen i am to move in with my- with my aunty and uncle, though.
16;high;12;therapist;Okay. you're good to explore, but i just want to ask you about, how much does chris-christian-christian know-- tristan know about you changing your life? what does he really know about the changes you wanna make?
16;high;13;client;I sit down and talk with him, asked him for, um, for support and stuff and he's fully, he says fully he'll be there for me. but, like i said, he's, um, he's in a different place in his life than i am in mine.
19;high;0;therapist;So you're sick of this?
19;high;1;client;Yeah. i-i just-- i can't shoplift anymore. you know, i got- i got caught again. and uh, you know, i-i got suspended, i got back to school, so i'm-i'm uh-- i'm gonna mess up my whole life here, unless i can stop this.
19;high;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.
19;high;3;client;Yeah, it's bad. my friends and i, we just-- i mean, it's fun and uh-- so i don't know what to do, but i- but i gotta change.
19;high;4;therapist;Okay.
19;high;5;client;I want it.
19;high;6;therapist;So, it sounds like you're ready. you're ready to give this up.
19;high;7;client;Yeah.
19;high;8;therapist;But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear.
19;high;9;client;Right. i don't know what i'm gonna do, i got some friends. these guys are-- they're bad news, but they're my friends.
20;high;0;therapist;So i wrote a prescription for antibiotics for aiden.
20;high;1;client;Okay.
20;high;2;therapist;Um, i did wanna talk to you though. i'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. and i-i noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home. so i was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that.
20;high;3;client;Well, um, it's just me and him and i do smoke. um, i try really hard not to smoke around him, but i-i've been smoking for 10 years except when i was pregnant with him. but it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and-and my having a full-time job. and so it's just-- that's why i started smoking again.
20;high;4;therapist;You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.
20;high;5;client;Yeah. some people have a glass of wine. i have a cigarette.
20;high;6;therapist;Sure. and it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. why did you make that decision?
20;high;7;client;I know it's not good for him. i mean, i've read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke.
20;high;8;therapist;So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?
20;high;9;client;Right. yeah. i mean, he doesn't have asthma. yeah. he-- i don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have, so. and i've thought about quitting before in the past, but i just don't- i just don't see how it's possible right now.
20;high;10;therapist;What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?
20;high;11;client;Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and i knew that he would get some of that. and i didn't-- i just didn't-didn't think i could live with myself if something happened to him.
20;high;12;therapist;Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?
20;high;13;client;Yeah, exactly.
20;high;14;therapist;How were you successful when you quit before?
20;high;15;client;I don't know. i-i think about it now, i don't even know how i did it. i just- i just did it. you know, i just- i just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-
20;high;16;therapist;Mm-hmm.
20;high;17;client;"-and-and him having problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. so i-- that was just enough to-to say, ""okay, you know what, i'm-i'm not going to risk that."" so."
20;high;18;therapist;Mm-hmm. the risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?
20;high;19;client;Yeah.
20;high;20;therapist;But they don't feel as scary to you now?
20;high;21;client;No, i mean, we're two separate people. and like i said, i don't, i try really hard not to smoke around him. i'm pretty good about that. i-i don't let other people smoke around him. um, so i, you know.
20;high;22;therapist;You're doing the best you can do.
20;high;23;client;Yes.
20;high;24;therapist;Okay. but it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?
20;high;25;client;"Yeah. i-i know that i need to, and i, you know, keep every new year i say, ""okay, this year i'm gonna quit smoking"" but then something happens and it-it just doesn't. and quitting doesn't happen."
20;high;26;therapist;It's on your to-do list. it's just not making it to the top?
20;high;27;client;Yeah.
21;high;0;therapist;Hi, laura.
21;high;1;client;Hi.
21;high;2;therapist;Thanks for coming in. um, so, i'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. if it's okay, i'll give you a little rundown.
21;high;3;client;Yeah.
21;high;4;therapist;So, basically, we're here, i'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. it's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. basically, i'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how i could help you with that, and just what i can do that's going to be most beneficial for you.
21;high;5;client;Okay.
21;high;6;therapist;Does that sound okay?
21;high;7;client;Yeah.
21;high;8;therapist;All right, so, i guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?
21;high;9;client;Well, my name is laura. i'm 17 years old, and i'm a senior in high school.
21;high;10;therapist;Okay. and, what kinds of things do you plan for your life?
21;high;11;client;Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college.
21;high;12;therapist;Hm.
21;high;13;client;Yeah.
21;high;14;therapist;That's great.
21;high;15;client;Yeah.
21;high;16;therapist;Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or?
21;high;17;client;Um, i'm not sure yet. maybe a few schools in the area, i'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state.
21;high;18;therapist;Oh.
21;high;19;client;So, maybe move away for college.
21;high;20;therapist;Cool.
21;high;21;client;Yeah.
21;high;22;therapist;So, kind of keeping your options open.
21;high;23;client;Yeah, definitely.
21;high;24;therapist;Great. and, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or?
21;high;25;client;Yeah, maybe um, pre-law.
21;high;26;therapist;Oh, wow. okay, that's exciting.
21;high;27;client;Yeah.
21;high;28;therapist;All right, cool. uh, what do you like to do for fun?
21;high;29;client;Well, um, on the weekends i like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or-
21;high;30;therapist;Mm-hmm.
21;high;31;client;-something like that, yeah.
21;high;32;therapist;You like to have a good time?
21;high;33;client;Yeah.
21;high;34;therapist;And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or?
21;high;35;client;Um, i would say like a moderate amount. i'm not really-really popular or like, i have no friends.
21;high;36;therapist;Mm-hmm.
21;high;37;client;So, i'm like normal.
21;high;38;therapist;All right.
21;high;39;client;Yeah.
21;high;40;therapist;That's a good way to be, right?
21;high;41;client;Yeah. [chuckles]
21;high;42;therapist;All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- things are going pretty well for you. how are your grades right now?
21;high;43;client;Um, they're pretty good, as and bs. so, i'm doing okay.
21;high;44;therapist;Okay.
21;high;45;client;Through college.
21;high;46;therapist;Great. well, one thing i want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. they might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. so, i'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. so, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. which of those do you think is sort of important to you?
21;high;47;client;Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging.
21;high;48;therapist;Okay.
21;high;49;client;Yeah.
21;high;50;therapist;What's important to you about your family?
21;high;51;client;Well, i-i love them, so i want them to think well of me-
21;high;52;therapist;Hm.
21;high;53;client;-and i want them to, um, be accepting and love me.
21;high;54;therapist;Okay. do you have brothers or sisters?
21;high;55;client;Yeah, i have one sister.
21;high;56;therapist;Okay, great. and, how about friendship?
21;high;57;client;Friendship, um, i've-i've grown close to many people that i care about. so, i would like them to be accepting of me as well.
21;high;58;therapist;Great. so, being a good friend and-
21;high;59;client;Yeah.
21;high;60;therapist;-having people who are good friends, too, is important. and then, what about belonging? you mentioned that one too.
21;high;61;client;Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- and like getting accepted-
21;high;62;therapist;Hm.
21;high;63;client;-in general, yeah.
21;high;64;therapist;Yeah. wanting to be part of a group-
21;high;65;client;Yeah.
21;high;66;therapist;-and kinda. okay, great. all right, well, one of the things i wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. and, i'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever ha
21;high;67;client;Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most.
21;high;68;therapist;Okay. can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene?
21;high;69;client;Um, i pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like i'm drinking, even though i'm not.
21;high;70;therapist;Hm.
21;high;71;client;So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something.
21;high;72;therapist;Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to-
21;high;73;client;Yeah just-
21;high;74;therapist;Kinda hold a drink.
21;high;75;client;Have one there and pretending to have it.
21;high;76;therapist;Okay.
21;high;77;client;Yeah.
21;high;78;therapist;And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? how-
21;high;79;client;Um.
21;high;80;therapist;Often do you think that you are around alcohol.
21;high;81;client;Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most?
21;high;82;therapist;Okay.
21;high;83;client;Not really much.
21;high;84;therapist;So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol?
21;high;85;client;Yeah.
21;high;86;therapist;Okay. and what sort of situations are you in?
21;high;87;client;Well, just i guess, at a party or something, someone's house.
21;high;88;therapist;Uh-huh.
21;high;89;client;Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around-
21;high;90;therapist;Hm.
21;high;91;client;Or something.
21;high;92;therapist;So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends.
21;high;93;client;Pretty much, yeah.
21;high;94;therapist;Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or-
21;high;95;client;Um—
21;high;96;therapist;Or mostly just-just with the kids?
21;high;97;client;Mostly just with us, but, sometimes i'll go to like a close friend's house and like i'm close to a family as well. so, we'll all just hang out.
21;high;98;therapist;Mm-hmm. and, what about driving?
21;high;99;client;Um, like drunk driving?
21;high;100;therapist;Yeah. do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol?
21;high;101;client;Um, definitely not. i've never drunk-driven, and i've never been in a car with a drunk driver.
21;high;102;therapist;Okay. so, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. it sound like you—
21;high;103;client;Yeah, because i know that's extremely dangerous, so.
21;high;104;therapist;Okay. what do you know about how that's dangerous?
21;high;105;client;Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. so, i mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so i'd rather not be in that situation.
21;high;106;therapist;So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that-
21;high;107;client;Yeah.
21;high;108;therapist;-you're not putting yourself-
21;high;109;client;Yeah, definitely.
21;high;110;therapist;-in those situations? that's great. you know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and i really commend you for being able to-to stick with that.
21;high;111;client;Thank you.
21;high;112;therapist;So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. what do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day?
21;high;113;client;Not more than two drinks.
21;high;114;therapist;Okay. so, the-the absolute most-
21;high;115;client;Yeah.
21;high;116;therapist;-was two? okay. and, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol?
21;high;117;client;Um, i've never really been drunk-
21;high;118;therapist;Uh-huh.
21;high;119;client;-so, i can't really say that i like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- i mean, you're just in a good mood.
21;high;120;therapist;Mm-hmm.
21;high;121;client;So.
21;high;122;therapist;So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or?
21;high;123;client;Yeah, yeah, relaxed.
21;high;124;therapist;Okay. uh, anything else?
21;high;125;client;Um, no, not really. like i said, i don't drink that much-
21;high;126;therapist;Mm-hmm.
21;high;127;client;So, i-i wouldn't be able to tell you.
21;high;128;therapist;Okay. and, any not-so-good things about alcohol?
21;high;129;client;Um, definitely, yeah. i mean, when i'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody.
21;high;130;therapist;Mm-hmm. so, you've seen a lot of other kids who-
21;high;131;client;Yeah.
21;high;132;therapist;-had some consequences-
21;high;133;client;Yeah.
21;high;134;therapist;-and decided that's not for you?
21;high;135;client;Yeah.
21;high;136;therapist;Got it. i-i can understand that. [chuckles] uh, any other things that you can think of?
21;high;137;client;Um, no, i mean, i've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. it's just-
21;high;138;therapist;Mm-hmm.
21;high;139;client;-very, like, obnoxious things.
21;high;140;therapist;Okay. well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- underage drinking is something that's not legal-
21;high;141;client;Yeah.
21;high;142;therapist;-and it is something that is considered pretty risky. so, i wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life.
21;high;143;client;Um, i know it's definitely risky, but, i mean, i guess, we still do it. [chuckles]
21;high;144;therapist;Uh-huh. so, it's kind of something that you're—
21;high;145;client;It's just there.
21;high;146;therapist;It's just there? okay. and, i'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. how does alcohol play a role with that?
21;high;147;client;Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone-
22;high;0;therapist;You did your values clarification handout, and that was part of what i wanted to go over with you today. i wanted to hear about your values and just talk to you a little bit more about that. do-do you wanna tell me what some of your top five values are?
22;high;1;client;Yes, um, my top value is family happiness, um, that's-
22;high;2;therapist;That's number one?
22;high;3;client;-that's number one to me, especially now. i usually do this values clarification sheet, like, every two to three months-
22;high;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.
22;high;5;client;-just to see if anything changed, and every time it has changed.
22;high;6;therapist;Oh. so, right now family value is the most important thing to you?
22;high;7;client;Yes.
22;high;8;therapist;Family happiness?
22;high;9;client;Yes, it's the most important because it's a little lacking, so i know that that's something that is very important to me.
22;high;10;therapist;Okay. would you like to talk more about that?
22;high;11;client;Yeah. um, i can just pretty much say that my family hasn't been on one accord, so, like, if-- i feel like if we all just can fall in the middle, which i know everybody doesn't really follow that track. so, um, i think for my part, 'cause i can't change anybody, is to be more present and, um, just listen and understand my family members, and-and be able to voice what i feel as far as how important family happiness-happiness is to me.
22;high;12;therapist;Mm. because even though it's important to you, maybe they don't know it's important to you.
22;high;13;client;Yes.
22;high;14;therapist;Is that what you're saying? yes?
22;high;15;client;Yeah.
22;high;16;therapist;And you want them to know?
22;high;17;client;And i want them to know how important it is to me, especially now, and i do this, like i said, every two to three months just to see where i am.
22;high;18;therapist;Uh-huh.
22;high;19;client;And, um, these definitely are different from-
22;high;20;therapist;Okay.
22;high;21;client;What i usually pick.
22;high;22;therapist;Okay.
22;high;23;client;"Um, and then the second one i said is religion. um, it was number one at first, um, but somehow with a big situation that happened in my family you kind of lose sight of your faith a little bit, which is normal. and not a lot of people-- they, uh-- well, in my church home, i-it just seems like, ""oh, you lost touch of god, oh my gosh, you're the devil."""
22;high;24;therapist;Uh-huh.
22;high;25;client;You know? and it's kind of like, well we all face those challenges every day, we're not perfect, you know? and i feel like my faith is still there but it's-- you know, as long as it's still there, that's all that matters.
22;high;26;therapist;Right. so, right now, it really is important to you to put the family values first? and religion is still very important to you, but you feel like maybe you're losing faith a little bit?
22;high;27;client;Yeah. i lost faith, and so i'm not afraid to say it.
22;high;28;therapist;Uh-huh.
22;high;29;client;You know? and once you say [unintelligible 00:03:12] people that don't really feel like that's—
22;high;30;therapist;Because you know that other people experience it too.
22;high;31;client;Yeah, i know that.
22;high;32;therapist;So, you know it's normal.
22;high;33;client;I know that it's normal.
22;high;34;therapist;But sometimes it's not something that people talk about.
22;high;35;client;Yeah, well, it's a—
22;high;36;therapist;Especially in the church.
22;high;37;client;"Yeah, it's like a shock to them when you say something like that. and it's like, ""well, we all go through things where we're just not sure, and--"" i still have a little bit, i'm not saying that i'm off track, you know? i still have a little bit to go on. and the little bit that i do have are the positive things in my life that i look at and i'm like, ""okay, well, i'm not in this situation, so i'm thankful,"" and-"
22;high;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.
22;high;39;client;"-you know, i'd still have faith to keep going on, but sometimes you feel as though, ""where is god?"""
22;high;40;therapist;Yeah.
22;high;41;client;You know?
22;high;42;therapist;And it sounds like right now you're at a place of acceptance about that also.
22;high;43;client;Yes.
22;high;44;therapist;Uh, that it's okay with you, and you-you know that it's gonna change because that's been your, uh, experience.
22;high;45;client;Yes.
22;high;46;therapist;You've done numerous values clarification handouts and every time they're different-
22;high;47;client;Mm-hmm.
22;high;48;therapist;-so you know that it's going to change.
22;high;49;client;Yeah.
22;high;50;therapist;And you accept that?
22;high;51;client;"I've accepted that. at first, i was like, ""whoa,"" i think i was focused too much on the first time i did it-"
22;high;52;therapist;Mm-hmm.
22;high;53;client;-then the second time that i did it-- i did five of these total-
22;high;54;therapist;Mm-hmm.
22;high;55;client;"-but the second time that i did it i was so focused on, ""what did i read about last time?"" you know?"
22;high;56;therapist;Yeah.
22;high;57;client;So, and i just went ahead and blanked that out and i just went and i-
22;high;58;therapist;Yes.
22;high;59;client;"-compared and i was like, ""oh wow."""
22;high;60;therapist;I really applaud you for being open-minded enough to realize that where you are now is not necessarily where you are, that you don't have to always have it be the same.
22;high;61;client;"Mm-hmm, and that's what i felt wasn't-- at first i was like, ""is that not normal?"" you know?"
22;high;62;therapist;Mm-hmm.
22;high;63;client;But, i noticed people go through things every day. i go through things in life. things are gonna change.
22;high;64;therapist;Mm-hmm.
22;high;65;client;Things do not stay the same. um, you know, like, you may be here, you're gonna go there, you're gonna go over there, not necessarily saying you're gonna fall down, but your view on life changes the more experience, the more life, every day-
22;high;66;therapist;Yeah.
22;high;67;client;-every day your eyes-- well, to me, my eyes have gotten broader, and broader, and broader. so—
22;high;68;therapist;Right.
22;high;69;client;"I don't limit myself to change anymore, i just kind of fill it out, and then [unintelligible 00:05:38] i'm like, ""okay."""
22;high;70;therapist;All right.
22;high;71;client;That's cool, so i'll focus more on that, than on the unnecessary stuff in my life.
22;high;72;therapist;Mm-hmm. do you feel that there are some parts of your life where you'd like to be more in line with your values, or do you feel like you're really on target with them?
22;high;73;client;"Um, i mentioned before that it was kind of, like, out of place for me, because when i did this one in particular, um, as-as-- i stated that there were-- the other three were important to me, but i haven't focused on it so i'm like, ""okay, it's important to me,"" so i lost track of that and the other three—"
22;high;74;therapist;The other three?
22;high;75;client;Um, number three was health.
22;high;76;therapist;Mm-hmm.
22;high;77;client;Number four is inner harmony, and number five is security.
22;high;78;therapist;Inner harmony, health, and security-
23;high;0;therapist;Hi, hannah. nice to meet you.
23;high;1;client;Hi.
23;high;2;therapist;So i understand that you were referred to me by your gp because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties.
23;high;3;client;Yeah. um, yeah, i guess it kind of- it kind of started like five, six years ago.
23;high;4;therapist;Okay.
23;high;5;client;Um, it kind of escalated a bit. um, i've just recently moved out, um, from living with my parents. so just made it a bit worse, i think.
23;high;6;therapist;Okay. is this the first time that you've left home?
23;high;7;client;Yeah, i am- yeah. it's the first time actually, yeah. um, i was going to a few years ago. i just thought it'd be easier to stay at home, so.
23;high;8;therapist;Okay. so it has been quite a big step and a big change and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your gp.
23;high;9;client;Yeah.
23;high;10;therapist;So how has that, uh, changed things for you?
23;high;11;client;Um, don't know, it's kind of, i haven't really told anyone, so, i mean, it's made it like better in sense. i feel, hopefully this is, this is it like, it- it'll help, but i don't know. i don't like thinking that i've like have to do this. i never thought i'd like be the kind of person you'd have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense.
23;high;12;therapist;Okay. so how do you feel about being here today?
23;high;13;client;It's like scared. i don't know. hopefully, it will help.
23;high;14;therapist;Okay. so you'd, you're feeling a little bit anxious about today.
23;high;15;client;Yeah.
23;high;16;therapist;Okay. so i guess just going back to why you went to the gp and how you've ended up kind of coming here today. so it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years. um, but just recently you moved out of home for the first time and, um, and that was what kind of led you to go to the gp. so how did that change things? how were things after you moved out?
23;high;17;client;Um, i thought that they'd be better, but 'cause i thought i'd have to kind of be independent and i suppose actually a lot worse. so i'm-i'm just kind of staying in the house a lot. i don't really have any friends or anything. i mean my family come and visit a bit, but it's not-- i don't know. it's kind of scary because i've just been kind of-- that should just end the flight by myself, which i always thought i'd like, but i don't actually like it.
23;high;18;therapist;Okay. so what other kinds of difficulties that you have been experiencing?
23;high;19;client;Um, i mean, i'm-i'm a photographer. um, so i kind of-- it's-it's been stopping me a bit, my anxiety, from being able to get work and because every time, you know, there's, uh, an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people, i just tend to just turn it down. so it was kind of making things hard in that respect and um, just kind of friends wise and everything. i just feel like i'm just kind of increasingly more alone. so it's kind of stopping me from making friends and, you know, like relationships and stuff.
23;high;20;therapist;Okay. so you said that, um, your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things. so they're, they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer, i guess that- that can be kind of a problem. and they're also stopping you or you feel like it's stunting you, uh, socially. you're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people.
23;high;21;client;Yeah, yeah. um, it was kind of easier when i was at home because i was obviously, i mean, my parents, so it's fine, but you know, they would, i'd go to places with, um, or i'd kind of have people there, but more and more, i'm just finding myself just staying in a lot. i mean-- i went like two weeks ago for coffee with my friends and the whole time i was just kind of wanting to go home again. so i don't, i just don't want to-- i don't want that to happen. i don't want to lose everyone. so-
23;high;22;therapist;So you're kind of worried about how, where this is going to lead to.
23;high;23;client;Yeah. um, yeah.
23;high;24;therapist;So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in about five or six years ago.
23;high;25;client;Yeah.
23;high;26;therapist;So you would have been about 19.
23;high;27;client;Yeah.
23;high;28;therapist;And what was happening around that time?
23;high;29;client;Uh, i guess i'd finished school about a year before that. um, and i mean, i-i've always been a bit shy, um, at school, but it was never ever, uh, like it didn't really affect the things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, i guess. it just started when i- like my friends went to university, and, i don't know, i felt like i was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there.i just stop going to parties or i'd just say no to invitations or i don't know, i thought my job would help because i mean, i love it. i've- i really like doing photography, but i'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on, so, which is my thing, you know, but—
23;high;30;therapist;What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?
23;high;31;client;I guess when it- i have to kind of be working with other people. um, i don't like that. it's like when i'm trying to kind of- would do an event or something where there's a lot of people there, not just photographers, but actual, you know, if i'm like taking places with people that i don't know, i just kind of find myself saying, you know, i mean, i want to do them, but just is scary. so i just don't do it.
23;high;32;therapist;So i guess, tell me a bit more about what happens then. so let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with, uh, you know, it's going to involve, uh, photography with- with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction. what kind of thoughts go through your head?
23;high;33;client;Um, just, i mean, i get really hot and sweaty, and i don't-- i feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that i'm just like really stupid, and i feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking, i just can't do my job. and i'm just an idiot. and i mean, they'll think that i just look like a weirdo and i just try and-- i mean, i just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else. so that's why i like doing shots where it's just me and the camera 'cause i- then i can just put all my attention on that instead of having to, you know, be with other people.
23;high;34;therapist;"Okay. so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation and you think, ""people will look, people will stare, people will think i'm a weirdo."" so there's quite a lot about what you- what you think other the people will think. and how does that make you feel?"
23;high;35;client;Um, just makes me feel like an idiot, makes me feel like i just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anymore. i should just go home and i just-- i think i just don't want to be in that situation. i just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal and i'm just the freak, you can't, like do normal things and—
23;high;36;therapist;Okay. can you give me an example of a-a recent situation? maybe we can focus on that.
23;high;37;client;Um, like a work situation or just--?
23;high;38;therapist;Yeah, time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety, you know, that you're describing, you felt that kick in.
23;high;39;client;Yeah. i was doing a job where it was kind of like a- a nature issue and i was having to work with a lot of different people. um, and, um, when they told me about the job, i thought it would be fine. i thought it was just going to be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and, you know, i was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that. and i guess- they asked me to, um—
23;high;40;therapist;It's quite interesting. was that a fashion shoot or something?
23;high;41;client;Yeah. yeah. it was a fashion thing. i think it was for some kind of-- i'm not sure if it was a campaign or something, but, it was-
23;high;42;therapist;Okay.
23;high;43;client;Yeah, it was, yeah, it was really cool, but i find it- found it really hard to try and focus on that 'cause i was so- i was kind of feeling really anxious and—
23;high;44;therapist;So it wasn't what you expected?
23;high;45;client;No. no.
23;high;46;therapist;So how long ago was that?
24;high;0;therapist;Hey, can i help you?
24;high;1;client;Yeah, i hope so. um, my workplace has just gone smoke-free. i-i'm not-not very happy about it. i'm gonna keep smoking, but i was wondering if there's anything that-that can help me like get through the day. it's like, you know, go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work.
24;high;2;therapist;So your workplaces went smoke-free and you're not too pleased, huh?
24;high;3;client;No. i'm not gonna quit smoking. i mean, i like it. it helps me relax. so, i mean, i don't see what the big deal is.
24;high;4;therapist;Okay. tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day. it'll help with the—
24;high;5;client;I mean, i smoke a little less than a pack a day. it's not too bad. um, i've probably smoked for the last five years, but i-i-i mean, could quit if i wanted to, but i don't really want to right now.
24;high;6;therapist;Okay. so you feel like, right now, smoking's a pretty important part of your life. it's not something you're ready to change, but if the time came when you did decide to quit, you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that.
24;high;7;client;Sure. i can quit.
24;high;8;therapist;Okay. what makes you so confident?
24;high;9;client;Well, i mean, i don't see why i couldn't, i-- although i have not ever tried to quit, it's just something that i do for fun, you know, on breaks at work, in the morning, and after work.
24;high;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. and so in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10, where one is, i'm not considering it at all, and 10 is, i'm definitely ready, i wanna quit.
24;high;11;client;I am probably a two. i-i haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today, i- i'm totally not gonna quit smoking.
24;high;12;therapist;Okay. what made you say two instead of one?
25;high;0;therapist;So, liz, what's something that you'd like to change or maybe that you're feeling two ways about right now?
25;high;1;client;Um, i really want to start working out again. definitely wanna get back in it, have a routine, and just be healthy.
25;high;2;therapist;Okay, and-and why would you want to make this change?
25;high;3;client;Um, i'm sick of feeling the way i do. i feel kinda sluggish. especially with the winter coming, i think i want to have more energy.
25;high;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.
25;high;5;client;Um, i don't like the way my clothes fit or don't fit me.
25;high;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.
25;high;7;client;Just, i don't feel comfortable.
25;high;8;therapist;Yeah. so, you're not feeling comfortable with the way that, you said, your clothes fit.
25;high;9;client;Mm-hmm.
25;high;10;therapist;What are some of the reasons why, um, it would be good for you to kinda make this change?
25;high;11;client;Um, i know exercise is-- in the past, has always made me feel good. i felt good about myself, and just in general, exercise, i know, makes me feel good. i want to be a good example for my kids. i want them to feel like that's a part of life-
25;high;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.
25;high;13;client;-exercising. so, i want-- i really just want to go get back in a routine.
25;high;14;therapist;So, to heal-- feel healthy for yourself as well be a good role model for your kids?
25;high;15;client;Yeah.
25;high;16;therapist;So, if you did decide to get exercising more into your daily routine, how would you go about doing it?
25;high;17;client;Um, i don't know. i'd probably have to sit down maybe with my husband and try to figure out a good time for me to be able to do that, where he'd be home with the kids and i'd be going to do that, whether it's morning-time, evening, maybe the weekends.
25;high;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.
25;high;19;client;Just to find the time to be able to do it, or what works in our schedule.
26;high;0;therapist;So what's been going on?
26;high;1;client;I just want my call, that's it.
26;high;2;therapist;All right. yeah, i was told that you're phone calls was taken away
26;high;3;client;[scoffs] yeah.
26;high;4;therapist;What-what happened?
26;high;5;client;I don't know. some of-- one of the officers, it's like he has it out for me or something. i don't- i don't know what it is. something about me not making my bed, something about my attitude. i don't know, i just want my call, man.
26;high;6;therapist;Okay. yeah, it was weird when i, uh, got that report because for the most part since you've been here, uh, you'd been like, uh, model-model resident, uh, always making their bed, uh, been pretty, uh, respectful of the staff, of all the other residents. so, uh, is it something to do with you getting out in three weeks? it must be pretty hard.
27;low;0;therapist;I understand that your asthma symptoms have been just really out of control. so, we need to look at some of the ways that you can get healthy and not be back here again.
27;low;1;client;Mm-hmm. yeah, i de-i definitely don't wanna come back here. but, uh, the doc said oscar, my dog, is connected to my asthma symptoms. but the-
27;low;2;therapist;Yeah.
27;low;3;client;-ridiculous part is i've had him for 12 years before, and now it's a problem.
27;low;4;therapist;Well, you sound a bit surprised by that. but i'm sure that you've seen some of the material that-that the clinic gave you about asthma symptoms and managing your asthma, and pets are a really big source of problems in that respect.
27;low;5;client;Yeah, but i-- um, let me just clarify, i've seen the materials, i have them-
27;low;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.
27;low;7;client;-i have even read them. all i've been doing is taking the medicine. so, i don't know that much about this.
27;low;8;therapist;Well, uh, wait a second, sal, what do you mean you-you- ha- if you-- as in-- you know to be informed about-- i'm just really taken aback by that because i understand from your chart that you have a young baby-
27;low;9;client;Yeah.
27;low;10;therapist;A new baby.
27;low;11;client;John carlo, yeah.
27;low;12;therapist;-and you are very concerned about your health, you wanna be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps, you've-you've almost quit smoking-
28;high;0;therapist;Hi carrie, thanks for coming in today.
28;high;1;client;Thank you, my doctor [unintelligible 00:00:05]
28;high;2;therapist;What brings you in?
28;high;3;client;Well am having, um-- i've been an ongoing problem with smoking and trying to quit.
28;high;4;therapist;So, you'd like to give up those cigarettes?
28;high;5;client;Oh i've been wanting to, for a long long time in years.
28;high;6;therapist;Yeah, so then it's, um, right now, uh, tell me a little bit about, um, right now at this point in your life why it's so important to quit.
28;high;7;client;Well i have a 15-year-old daughter and she's highly against it. and, um, health issues, you know, i'm getting-- not getting any younger and i have asthma and i have chronic bronchi-- bronchitis and, um, i'm having a hard time breathing when i exercise and not to mention it's socially unacceptable really.
28;high;8;therapist;Like being a leper in a leper colony right now to be a smoker.
28;high;9;client;Actually it's like being a leper in a non-leper colony.
28;high;10;therapist;'cause you can't find a leper colony anymore. so, um, so it-it's really important for you to be a good mum-
28;high;11;client;Right.
28;high;12;therapist;-and model for your- for your daughter who's at this age where 15 would be a really common age at which she might decide to smoke.
28;high;13;client;Right and, um, she's been expressing, you know, she walks in and she's like shhh and it's embarrassing for her friends and, um, and in-in turn, it's embarrassing for me.
28;high;14;therapist;Okay. so, you-you wanna look good, you know, and she's proud of you i'm sure anyway and then this just would be an added benefit. yeah.
28;high;15;client;Right right, yeah.
28;high;16;therapist;So, and then you mentioned quite a few things about medical problems. so, um, you mentioned, um, asthma, um, acute bronchitis did you say—
28;high;17;client;Oh and emphysema the beginning stages of emphysema.
28;high;18;therapist;Oh my goodness. okay. and so, and that-- yeah, that's very-- that's really scary beginnings of emphysema, i'm sorry to hear that.
28;high;19;client;Thank you.
28;high;20;therapist;Well, i mean that's-that's, you know, tell me about when you were diagnosed with that.
28;high;21;client;I really couldn't tell you, um, i remember when my daughter was like five, um, i was-- it was humid out and i have a problem with humidity-
28;high;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.
28;high;23;client;-you know, for breathing, um, and, um, i was trying to stick my head out the window to gasp for air-
28;high;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.
28;high;25;client;-and my daughter became so frightened that she went next door to our neighbor and called 911 and it really—
28;high;26;therapist;Smart girl.
28;high;27;client;Yeah-yeah she's very intelligent, yeah. um, and they came they took me, you know, on this chair type of thing in my robe and my daughter was in sure panic, um, thinking she's was gonna lose me and she's 15 so its been 10 years since then and i still i've tried this chantix-
28;high;28;therapist;Mm-hmm.
28;high;29;client;-unsuccessfully, uh,--
28;high;30;therapist;Tell me a little bit about what happened with the-the chantix.
28;high;31;client;Well, um, i don't know if it's my lack of willpower but, um, also had ve-very bad side effects from it so.
28;high;32;therapist;Mm-hmm. mm-hmm. wh-what sort of if-if you are willing to talk about what kind of side effect—
28;high;33;client;Um, i had nightmares-
28;high;34;therapist;Mm-hmm.
28;high;35;client;-nausea-
28;high;36;therapist;Mm-hmm.
28;high;37;client;-um, stomach problems, and agitation. yeah.
28;high;38;therapist;Oh really. you know, and i've heard that too, carrie, that people especially you know those are, um, some people seem to have a lot of success but when people do have the adverse side effects they are really pronounced like the ones you just described.
28;high;39;client;Right and it didn't stop me from smoking as well, so that's, uh, [laughs]—
28;high;40;therapist;Want the good [crosstalk] no good right? and how long ago was that that you—
28;high;41;client;Um, that was about two to three years ago.
28;high;42;therapist;Okay, all right.
28;high;43;client;I tried it a couple of times.
28;high;44;therapist;Okay.
28;high;45;client;"I would get a, um, a new prescription refilled thinking, ""oh i could try it this time."""
28;high;46;therapist;Mm-hmm.
28;high;47;client;And i had friends that it worked for-
28;high;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.
28;high;49;client;Um, and there is a support group that they have that you can go online or call-
28;high;50;therapist;Okay.
28;high;51;client;-but of course i didn't do either but-
28;high;52;therapist;Mm-hmm.
28;high;53;client;-um—
28;high;54;therapist;It just didn't fit for you to do the online.
28;high;55;client;No. yeah.
28;high;56;therapist;Okay. so, um, but you gave it a good try and it was just not a good fit for you like you-you really listened to what your body told you like nightmares, nausea, i mean those are really bad things.
28;high;57;client;And agitation really-
28;high;58;therapist;Oh yeah.
28;high;59;client;-because, um, you know, um, being at my age i'm going through the menopause stage which is part, you know, you'll have that anyways and then having 15-year-old that causes a little bit more stress so you don't need any extra stress, i don't think, as far
28;high;60;therapist;So, it's already piled i'm thinking up for you, you don't need anything else so you're looking for some relief and not something to make you feel worse.
28;high;61;client;Right, exactly.
28;high;62;therapist;Um, have there been some times in the past where you were able to quit smoking completely?
28;high;63;client;Only when i was in the hospital. [chuckles]
28;high;64;therapist;Okay.
28;high;65;client;And even then i-i snuck out and had a cigarette, you know.
28;high;66;therapist;Okay. so, what's the longest you've ever gone without a cigarette including being in the hospital?
28;high;67;client;Oh god, i would have to say, uh, three days.
28;high;68;therapist;Oh, three days. you know, that's a long time and i felt, you know, that's a pretty long time to go without smoking and i would imagine, i think that's pretty good.
28;high;69;client;But it was not really by choice, it was by, um, the situation i was in, i wasn't able to smoke so, yeah.
28;high;70;therapist;You were forced to-
28;high;71;client;Right.
28;high;72;therapist;Not smoke?
32;low;0;therapist;In summary, the minnesota state, mankato security report states that you were stopped on stadium road last friday, cited for driving under the influence, and then you were transported to detox. plus, you're only 21 years old. is the report accurate?
32;low;1;client;I-i guess, uh, i don't really remember much. i like it was a week ago, so i was kind of drunk too.
32;low;2;therapist;Okay. behavior like this could get you suspended, doesn't that concern you?
32;low;3;client;Hmm. i mean, not really. i'm gonna be 21 in a couple of months. um, once i turn 21, the cops can't give me a minor and i mean, i'm not a heavy drinker, like-like my friends or anything. i don't get wasted at all. and, uh, i just need to be careful. i just won't get caught. i'm just trying to find, like, a normal college student.
32;low;4;therapist;What were you thinking when you got into your car after having six beers, you could have caused an accident and killed somebody.
32;low;5;client;Whatever, i-i didn't though. i called my roommates for a ride. he was sleepy. so i had to get home somehow. and this isn't even my fault. i give him rides all the time, but i didn't do anything.
32;low;6;therapist;You need to take responsibility for your actions. if you keep partying like this, your problems will only get worse. you're likely to face costly legal citations, poor grades, health problems. getting kicked out of school and disappointing your parents. you don't want that to happen, do you?
33;high;0;therapist;Okay, david. so, why don't you take a rinse, and how are you feeling?
33;high;1;client;Hmm, pretty good.
33;high;2;therapist;Would you like to-
33;high;3;client;Check it, yeah.
33;high;4;therapist;Check this out? what do you think?
33;high;5;client;Oh, that was fixed really nice.
33;high;6;therapist;Yeah.
33;high;7;client;You got rid of that bad-
33;high;8;therapist;Yeah.
33;high;9;client;Discoloration that was there.
33;high;10;therapist;Yeah. no.
33;high;11;client;I like that.
33;high;12;therapist;It went well. good. excellent. i did notice quite a lot of staining, actually. i'm wondering what are your thoughts about what might be related to that.
33;high;13;client;Mm. well, the usual suspects, smoking, wine, coffee-
33;high;14;therapist;Yeah.
33;high;15;client;All of the above.
33;high;16;therapist;Any thoughts on considering quitting smoking at this time?
33;high;17;client;Yeah, i've thought about it. i'm just-- it's not my cup-- i-i-i hear it from everybody, and, uh, i've tried- i've tried before, didn't work. i get it all the time.
33;high;18;therapist;"Okay. and it's like here i am one more person, the next- the next doctor who's saying, ""you need to quit smoking, david."""
33;high;19;client;Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, [unintelligible 00:01:13] hmm.
33;high;20;therapist;Mm, and i'm sorry, that's not how i mean to come across at all.
33;high;21;client;"Yeah, i-i-i know i'm not an idiot and people know that smokers are, you know, ""how can you smoke today?"" [coughs] it's just not that easy to, uh, quit."
33;high;22;therapist;Mm-hmm, and if it was as easy as the doctor is saying or your partner-
33;high;23;client;Yeah.
33;high;24;therapist;-saying-
33;high;25;client;Uh, who wouldn't be?
33;high;26;therapist;You have to quit.
33;high;27;client;You'd have to be a real fool not to do it-
33;high;28;therapist;Yeah.
33;high;29;client;-if you [unintelligible 00:01:34] was gonna make it like that.
33;high;30;therapist;Yeah.
33;high;31;client;I-i just hear it every day.
33;high;32;therapist;Yeah. and what's been your past experience with smoking? tell me-- can you tell me a little bit about kind of how the role it plays in your life, how long you've smoked?
33;high;33;client;I've smoked for 40 years, since i was 14-
33;high;34;therapist;Mm-hmm.
33;high;35;client;-and quit a couple of times, off and on in my 20s, but, you know, it's been consistent. and i can't see myself changing now.
33;high;36;therapist;Mm-hmm.
33;high;37;client;No matter what kinda talk i get or what they come up with.
33;high;38;therapist;It sounds like almost you've tried a lot of things that are out there and it's not something that you're—
33;high;39;client;Not gonna worked for me.
33;high;40;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
33;high;41;client;No.
33;high;42;therapist;Yeah.
33;high;43;client;I know cold turkey is probably the only thing that's ever gonna do it to anybody that's done it. mysel- my group, it's been cold turkey-
33;high;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.
33;high;45;client;-and then they fight it, but [sighs] it's my choice-
34;high;0;therapist;Thank you for coming in to see me today, nina. i'm looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and hearing a little bit about you and what brought you in here today.
34;high;1;client;Um, my doctor referred me. he said i had to come because i've- i've been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. yeah.
34;high;2;therapist;Okay. he's thinking you were a little irresponsible.
34;high;3;client;Yeah. um, he said that i was drinking too much with it. um, i-i haven't been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw things up.
34;high;4;therapist;And you're feeling kind of concerned about that.
34;high;5;client;Yeah. yeah. like i don't- i don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, i'm just- i'm scared i already did.
34;high;6;therapist;Okay. so, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.
34;high;7;client;Mm-hmm. yeah.
34;high;8;therapist;And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.
34;high;9;client;"Yeah. he didn't really tell me what to expect. he just said, ""go- go see her as well."""
34;high;10;therapist;So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.
34;high;11;client;Yeah. um, i didn't find out i was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-
34;high;12;therapist;Okay.
34;high;13;client;-and i had already been drinking then. um, i've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.
34;high;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. so, there's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene.
34;high;15;client;A little bit. i think if i- if i talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? like i'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.
34;high;16;therapist;Kind of feels like you're between two worlds. in one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-
34;high;17;client;Yeah.
34;high;18;therapist;-drinking and your friends are-
34;high;19;client;"Yeah, like, i'm- i'm still, like, i'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""okay, it's party time,"" and now i kind of have to, like, break out of that."
34;high;20;therapist;Okay. so, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? or does it feel like i want to hang out there still too?
34;high;21;client;There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because i'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. i know i'm gonna- i know i'm going to have to change.
34;high;22;therapist;"So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""i can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. it's time to go to the mom world maybe."
34;high;23;client;Yeah. probably. and i'm also feeling like it's too late. i already screwed it up.
34;high;24;therapist;Okay. so, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. what do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?
34;high;25;client;"Well, i know, like, they say not to, but i thought because my friends didn't really care, i thought, ""okay. like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. maybe it's just what they tell you."" just like drinking, in general, is bad."
34;high;26;therapist;So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.
34;high;27;client;Yeah.
34;high;28;therapist;And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.
34;high;29;client;Yeah, like, i should probably have trusted my gut.
34;high;30;therapist;So, your gut is telling you what? tell me about that.
34;high;31;client;It's telling me that what i'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that i'm gonna really regret that once i actually get my kid.
34;high;32;therapist;And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. and kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?
34;high;33;client;Um, i'm definitely it's not-- i think i could probably do it. it's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. you're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. you wanna be yourself. you wanna be who you were before.
34;high;34;therapist;So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. i wanna be that person, yet, that person-
34;high;35;client;And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. and i don't wanna be that person. i don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.
34;high;36;therapist;Mm. so, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-
34;high;37;client;Yeah, suburbs. yeah.
34;high;38;therapist;So, you don't wanna be that- that- that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you.
34;high;39;client;Yeah, i-i guess. like, i don't wanna- i don't wanna lose my friends because of this. and i don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, i mean, they're good people. they're just—
34;high;40;therapist;You care about them.
34;high;41;client;Yeah.
34;high;42;therapist;It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. and so now, you're here and you're not sure. you want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. you're not sure—
34;high;43;client;I don’t want that.
34;high;44;therapist;You don't want that.
34;high;45;client;No.
34;high;46;therapist;You want this baby.
34;high;47;client;Yeah.
34;high;48;therapist;And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing.
34;high;49;client;Like, i wanna- i wanna be responsible for this thing.
34;high;50;therapist;You don't wanna let your baby down.
34;high;51;client;No.
34;high;52;therapist;"And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you're thinking, ""i don't have a choice. i've got to look this way."" is that kind of what it feels like?"
34;high;53;client;I guess so. i feel like i've already made a choice and already made some bad choices with this.
34;high;54;therapist;Nina, i'm wondering, what's your hope for the future? when you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?
34;high;55;client;Well, i-i kept the kid because i wanted-- it was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? like i-i still feel like a teenager sometimes. and having that push to be a real person is really-- it's a lot of pressure and i-i want to raise this kid well. i don't wanna- i don't wanna let my kid down. i don't wanna, you know, i don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because i think it's the right time, but i don't wanna- i don't wanna make mistakes that make me realize maybe i'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like i'm not ready for this.
34;high;56;therapist;"You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, ""this baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan b,"" and you guys both get to decide what plan b is gonna look like."
34;high;57;client;Yeah, i just guess it's easier said than done though. like, it's, like, great, i can make all these changes and i can be a completely new person, but it's, like, at the end of the day, i'm still just who i am.
34;high;58;therapist;"While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""i'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live."
34;high;59;client;Yeah. and i'm just- you know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person.
34;high;60;therapist;"While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""do i deserve that second chance?"" and then this other part of you that says, ""why not? it's here and i wanna go for it."""
34;high;61;client;Yeah, i guess that voice is just a little more stifled by the other one.
34;high;62;therapist;Mm-hmm. you got a lot of people around you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking you back to the old life. and the baby is a constant reminder that there’s this new life ahead.
34;high;63;client;Yeah, it's gonna be very different when it actually comes.
34;high;64;therapist;When you think about, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path a and moving into path b, how confident are you that you can take path b and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with the drinking and the life that you were in-in path a?
34;high;65;client;I think i'm gonna have to be successful. i don't really- i don't have any other choice. like i have to- i have to take that path.
34;high;66;therapist;"Mm-hmm. tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""i have to take that path""? what makes you feel like you need that?"
34;high;67;client;Because i need to for my kid. it's- it's gonna be all screwed up if i don't.
34;high;68;therapist;"This part of you that says, ""i don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""do i have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" what do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?"
34;high;69;client;"I don't know, like, maybe- maybe actually talking to my friends and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid and go, ""of course, of course, your- your choice makes sense. you--"" maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if they actually, like, see it."
35;high;0;therapist;Hi, natalie. i'm dawn.
35;high;1;client;Hi, dawn. nice to meet you.
35;high;2;therapist;Nice to meet you, too. thanks for coming in today.
35;high;3;client;Thanks for having me.
35;high;4;therapist;Yeah. tell me a little bit about yourself.
35;high;5;client;So i am, um, 28. and i moved out to arizona about six months ago. um, i really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever i can. work keeps me pretty busy. um, but i'm really, um, looking to kind of make some changes to my diet and physical activity. i'm not really happy with where my weight's at right now, and, uh, so i thought it'd be good to come and talk with you about some of that stuff.
35;high;6;therapist;Yeah, you're feeling a little bit dissatisfied with your health patterns?
35;high;7;client;Yeah. um, i'm really starting to notice how i feel more sluggish and just not-- my mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, i thought was because it's getting colder outside, um, but i do also think it maybe has some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the foods that i'm eating.
35;high;8;therapist;Okay, so you're feeling some low energy and you know, in the past, when you've been more active and eating differently, you've had more energy?
35;high;9;client;Right. yeah. especially during times when i'm more active is when i noticed the biggest cha-change in energy and mood.
35;high;10;therapist;Yeah. tell me more about that, those previous times that you've been active.
35;high;11;client;Yeah. um, well, i played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and i just think back now to, as much that i would cram into a 24 -hour period, and like, wonder how i did that, but i think that part of it was because i was so active physically, um, i just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically to, um, you know, go to school full-time and-and still socialize with friends and do all that stuff. um, so when i think back to like, probably like the peak of my life of when i felt my best physically, mentally it was that time.
35;high;12;therapist;You had energy, and you were like the energizer bunny, just keep going and going and going.
35;high;13;client;Yeah, yeah, exactly. and now it's not so much the same. um, like when i get home from work, i'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when i've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working. and so, um, yeah, that's probably been my biggest, uh, issue is like when work ends, going home and not really doing anything. um, just trying to like unwind by watching netflix or something else, right?
35;high;14;therapist;So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career person, um, and your energy level isn't what it used to be. what-- do you have any ideas about why that might have shifted?
35;high;15;client;Um, well, i think part of it is that when i was in college, it wasn't really an option to go, like, i had to go to practice or i had to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, um, and now there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money. so that definitely has shifted, um, but i-i do feel like a-an urgency to go it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. like, i think i want to it's just the doing it that seems to not happen.
35;high;16;therapist;Right. so in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you had the choice to go be physically active. now it is up to you, and-and you're looking back at the last few years and saying, i wanna do things differently.
35;high;17;client;Mm-hmm.
35;high;18;therapist;I want to be more physically active than i've been.
35;high;19;client;Yeah, yeah, i think so. um, that's not to say like, i wanna go run a marathon but i do think that it would help me a lot in terms of just having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if i were to pick up some type of activity.
35;high;20;therapist;Great. and you've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise.
36;high;0;therapist;Barbara roberts?
36;high;1;client;Yes. morning.
36;high;2;therapist;Hello, there.
36;high;3;client;Hello.
36;high;4;therapist;My name's dr. betty. i'm one of the new gps in the practice. first of all, what would you like me to call you?
36;high;5;client;Well, you can call me barbara. that'll be fine. thank you.
36;high;6;therapist;Okay, that's fine. okay. so, barbara, i'm seeing you today, um, but i think it's usually dr. brown that sees you, is that right?
36;high;7;client;Yes, dr. brown is my doctor.
36;high;8;therapist;Okay. what is it that's brought you to see me today?
36;high;9;client;Well, i've come about my tummy problem. i've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, dr. brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. and i thought perhaps, uh, i'd come and see you to see if you could help.
36;high;10;therapist;All right. okay. can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?
36;high;11;client;Um, well, i-i have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. um, it very often feels bloated. i, um, uh, i swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. um, i have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. it's a real stabbing feeling. um, i often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and i pass very smelly wind.
36;high;12;therapist;All right. so, quite a few symptoms there-
36;high;13;client;Mm.
36;high;14;therapist;- and some of them sound-
36;high;15;client;Yes.
36;high;16;therapist;Quite troublesome to you.
36;high;17;client;Yes.
36;high;18;therapist;Okay. and how long has this been going on?
36;high;19;client;Well, i, uh, i've traced it back to a holiday i had in egypt about four years ago. i had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and i don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then.
36;high;20;therapist;Mm-hmm. okay. okay. so you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?
36;high;21;client;Yes. yes.
36;high;22;therapist;Okay. and what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before?
36;high;23;client;Well, uh, dr. brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning.
36;high;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;25;client;Um, but i've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. they've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines-
36;high;26;therapist;Right.
36;high;27;client;- for different things. um, no, oh, and immodium.
36;high;28;therapist;Right.
36;high;29;client;I have immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. yeah.
36;high;30;therapist;Right. so, these different tablets that you've got from the-
36;high;31;client;Hmm.
36;high;32;therapist;- the herbal shop-
36;high;33;client;Hmm.
36;high;34;therapist;How are you taking them?
36;high;35;client;Oh, well, different tablets, you know, i don't have the same problem every day-
36;high;36;therapist;Right.
36;high;37;client;- so i'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and-
36;high;38;therapist;Right.
36;high;39;client;Other tablets for other things.
36;high;40;therapist;So, am i- am i right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis-
36;high;41;client;Hmm.
36;high;42;therapist;- what you're gonna take-
36;high;43;client;Hmm.
36;high;44;therapist;- depending on what your stomach's doing?
36;high;45;client;Yeah.
36;high;46;therapist;Okay. okay. and what about tests? have you had any tests for these problems?
36;high;47;client;Yes, uh, i had, uh, in the early days, i had a gastros-gas-- what are they called?
36;high;48;therapist;A gastroscopy.
36;high;49;client;That's it. yes.
36;high;50;therapist;You got the tube down-down from the top?
36;high;51;client;Yes. yeah.
36;high;52;therapist;Okay.
36;high;53;client;Um, and at the same time i had a barium enema.
36;high;54;therapist;Right.
36;high;55;client;That was very uncomfortable.
36;high;56;therapist;Okay.
36;high;57;client;Um, but, um, no, i've tried-- well, you-- i don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything-
36;high;58;therapist;Right.
36;high;59;client;-and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. that's it now-
36;high;60;therapist;Right.
36;high;61;client;- as far as he's concerned. sent me back to the doctor.
36;high;62;therapist;Right. it sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that.
36;high;63;client;Well, you know, i think that actually, the nhs are running out of money, aren't they? and he's-
36;high;64;therapist;Right.
36;high;65;client;- decided that i've had enough tests.
36;high;66;therapist;Right.
36;high;67;client;And, um, you know, if you go on the internet-
36;high;68;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;69;client;- there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for.
36;high;70;therapist;Right.
36;high;71;client;Um, if i had a bit more money, i'd go private.
36;high;72;therapist;Right.
36;high;73;client;I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it.
36;high;74;therapist;Right. so you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests?
36;high;75;client;No, he's not. there's loads more he could do. i'm sure.
36;high;76;therapist;Right. okay. it sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years.
36;high;77;client;Mm.
36;high;78;therapist;You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach.
36;high;79;client;Mm.
36;high;80;therapist;Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. some prescribed, some herbal remedies-
36;high;81;client;Mm.
36;high;82;therapist;- and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough.
36;high;83;client;Yeah.
36;high;84;therapist;Is that- is that about-
36;high;85;client;I'd say so, yes.
36;high;86;therapist;If i got the story right.
36;high;87;client;Yes.
36;high;88;therapist;Okay. and can i ask you, barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? how's-how's it affecting your life?
36;high;89;client;Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. um, i mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, i suppose, is that i-i went from being full-time to part-time at work.
36;high;90;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;91;client;I just couldn't sit all day comfortably.
36;high;92;therapist;Right.
36;high;93;client;Um, and so i went part-time, but in the end, i, uh, about a year ago, i stopped work altogether.
36;high;94;therapist;Right. right.
36;high;95;client;Um, i miss that.
36;high;96;therapist;Right.
36;high;97;client;I miss the girls. we used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week.
36;high;98;therapist;Right.
36;high;99;client;To the pictures or for a drink. that's one thing.
36;high;100;therapist;Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed.
36;high;101;client;Yeah, so i-- yes. yes, we used to have a laugh.
36;high;102;therapist;Right. okay.
36;high;103;client;Um, i used to go to swing and shape. i used to go to an exercise class-
36;high;104;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;105;client;- that was, um, i miss the exercise, actually. that was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was i wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. i was always worried i was gonna be taken short or-- so i stopped that.
36;high;106;therapist;Right.
36;high;107;client;Um, then-- well, my husband and i used to go out for meals.
36;high;108;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;109;client;That's another thing we don't do anymore now.
36;high;110;therapist;Right.
36;high;111;client;Um, mm. yeah, it's quite a few things, really.
36;high;112;therapist;Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed-
36;high;113;client;Mm.
36;high;114;therapist;Quite a lot because of these symptoms.
36;high;115;client;Yes.
36;high;116;therapist;It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do.
36;high;117;client;Mm.
36;high;118;therapist;Right.
36;high;119;client;Mm.
36;high;120;therapist;So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now?
36;high;121;client;Well, i potter around the house-
36;high;122;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;123;client;- um, i spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. i've got a bit hooked on daytime television, i have to say.
36;high;124;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;125;client;Um, they draw you in, don't they?
36;high;126;therapist;They certainly do.
36;high;127;client;Um, i read a bit-
36;high;128;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;129;client;- the old magazines, but, uh, generally, i'm at home.
36;high;130;therapist;Right.
36;high;131;client;Yeah.
36;high;132;therapist;Okay. okay. and have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? for example, have there been any times when things have been better for you?
36;high;133;client;Um, well, last year, um, my son got married-
36;high;134;therapist;Right.
36;high;135;client;- and i-i have to say i was worried that, um, that i wouldn't be able to cope with it.
36;high;136;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;137;client;That i-i wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, i was in good form, and i think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it-
36;high;138;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;139;client;And the whole hoo-ha of the wedding.
36;high;140;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;141;client;But i was in good- in really good form for that. yeah.
36;high;142;therapist;Right.
36;high;143;client;That was a good time.
36;high;144;therapist;Right. and how were you tummy symptoms then?
36;high;145;client;I hardly noticed them.
36;high;146;therapist;Right. okay.
36;high;147;client;Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up.
36;high;148;therapist;Right. right.
36;high;149;client;Which was good.
36;high;150;therapist;Right. that's interesting.
36;high;151;client;Mm.
36;high;152;therapist;And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? seem particularly bad?
36;high;153;client;Um, well, it's- i'm-i'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment.
36;high;154;therapist;Right.
36;high;155;client;It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. um, i have to say i do notice it when my husband's away. he-
36;high;156;therapist;Right.
36;high;157;client;- he travels with his job, and he-
36;high;158;therapist;Right.
36;high;159;client;Can be away a couple of times a month.
36;high;160;therapist;Uh-huh.
36;high;161;client;Um, and that's not-- it-it's very often not good then, i have to say.
36;high;162;therapist;Right. so you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? okay.
36;high;163;client;Mm. maybe i'm thinking about it a bit more, i don't know, when he's not there.
36;high;164;therapist;Right. i know you've been seeing dr. brown about this for the last few years.
36;high;165;client;Mm.
36;high;166;therapist;What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you?
36;high;167;client;Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head.
36;high;168;therapist;Right.
36;high;169;client;You know, he's- he says it's stress.
36;high;170;therapist;Right. okay.
36;high;171;client;Mm.
36;high;172;therapist;And what do you think?
36;high;173;client;Well, i mean, it can't all be in my head. i get too much physical pain-
36;high;174;therapist;Right.
36;high;175;client;- for it to be in my head. i mean, it's real. it's-it's real pain.
36;high;176;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;177;client;Um—
36;high;178;therapist;And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it?
36;high;179;client;Well, i mean, i-i did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up-
36;high;180;therapist;Mm-hmm.
36;high;181;client;- in the early stages, but, um, i think, um, i-i mean, sometimes i think it's ibs. a friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then-
36;high;182;therapist;Right.
36;high;183;client;"- other times i'll think, ""i wonder if it's an ulcer."""
36;high;184;therapist;Right.
36;high;185;client;Um, on a really bad day, i start to think it might be cancer.
36;high;186;therapist;Right.
36;high;187;client;Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that-
36;high;188;therapist;Mm-hmm.
38;high;0;therapist;Hi, sarah, it's great to meet you. my name is delwyn, and i'm a counselor here at the clinic. and i heard from your nurse practitioner that you recently had an annual exam in which the topics of smoking and alcohol use came up. would you mind filling me in a little bit about that?
38;high;1;client;Yeah, um, last week i met with my nurse practitioner, and i ge-i guess she's worried with how much i'm smoking and drinking right now. i mean, i-i did agree i would work on the smoking and try to cut back on that. but, as far as the drinking, i-i don't really think i drink that much.
38;high;2;therapist;So, you've decided you wanna cut back on your smoking a little bit, but, you're not really concerned about your drinking.
38;high;3;client;Right, i mean, i don't drink that much and, honestly, it-it's just a good way to relax.
38;high;4;therapist;It's a nice sort of form of stress relief.
38;high;5;client;Yeah, exactly. you know, it's kind of like that me time at the end of the day.
38;high;6;therapist;Sort of escape from your hectic schedule.
38;high;7;client;Yeah. you know, i have a two-year-old son, and then, i work full-time. and, i also started going back to school. so, you know, just trying to juggle all that stuff. you know, it's tiring, and so, you know, at the end of the day, i just- i wanna relax and enjoy myself.
38;high;8;therapist;So, you're working, and then, on top of that, juggling being a single mom and going to school?
38;high;9;client;Yeah, and for work, you know, i'm a server. so, i'm on my feet all day, you know, and it's-it's really tiring.
38;high;10;therapist;It's pretty exhausting work.
38;high;11;client;Yeah, you know, it's hard trying to please customers all day. and then, at the same time, i'm-i'm worrying, am i making enough money to support my son, you know?
38;high;12;therapist;So, you're not only doing really tiring work and going to school, but you're also worrying about your finances.
38;high;13;client;Yeah, and then, you know, with going back to school, you know, i have to figure out how i'm going to pay for everything. so, you know, i-it's just a lot right now.
38;high;14;therapist;Yeah, it does. it sounds like a lot that you're trying to deal with, and it makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward.
38;high;15;client;Mm-hmm.
38;high;16;therapist;So, tell me a little bit more about your drinking. tell me a little bit about how much you're drinking, and, um, the pattern, and what raised concern.
38;high;17;client;Well, that's the thing. i-i don't really understand what raised concern. i mean, i don't drink that much, you know. i've-i've gone up to maybe two drinks a day max, you know.
38;high;18;therapist;So, you're drinking, perhaps, two drinks a day. um, and i'm wondering, what have you heard about the recommendations for drinking levels?
38;high;19;client;Not much.
38;high;20;therapist;Okay, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?
38;high;21;client;Sure.
38;high;22;therapist;Okay. well, so, the recommendation for women is to have no more than three drinks a day, and no more than seven drinks over the course of a week. yeah, um, and, really, the reason for those recommendations is to just reduce the risk that people have trouble with accidents, or chronic diseases. like certain types of cancers, or high blood pressure, and then also psychological problems. i don't know what you think about all that?
38;high;23;client;I don't know, i-it just surprises me because, i mean, two drinks a day, that-that doesn't seem like a problem or risky, you know. and, i have family members who drink a lot more than that per day, and, it's not a problem for them. so, i-it just surprises me.
38;high;24;therapist;It just doesn't seem that abnormal to you, especially when you compare it with your family.
38;high;25;client;No. and then, i don't know, i-i'm just getting kind of annoyed, honestly, because, you know, i did agree i would try to work on my smoking, you know. but, with this whole drinking thing, it's like everything that i enjoy, you know, is being taken away from me right now. and so, if i give up drinking, like, what am i going to have to enjoy myself, you know.
38;high;26;therapist;Yeah, you really feel like you need that reward.
38;high;27;client;Yeah, yeah.
38;high;28;therapist;And then it also sounds like, um, your drinking has perhaps increased a little bit over time?
38;high;29;client;Yeah, i mean, i guess it has. probably just with being so stressed out every day, you know. i mean, i'm in my second semester of school right now, and so, adding that to everything, uh, it's a lot. and, you know, i'm trying to figure out child carry. um, normally, my mom will watch my son, but, lately, she can't always. and so, i'm always kind of worrying like, will she be able to, you know. so, i-it's just stressful.
38;high;30;therapist;Yeah, and so it sounds like you've noticed that the more stressed you're feeling, the more you're drinking.
38;high;31;client;Yeah, i-i guess that's right.
38;high;32;therapist;So, let me summarize a little bit what you've told me. it sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel like you need some kind of-
38;high;33;client;Uh-huh.
38;high;34;therapist;-reward or stress relief. um, and then, on the other hand, you've noticed, um, that your drinking has increased a little bit over time. and also that the more stressed you're fe- you feel, the more you're inclined to drink.
38;high;35;client;Yeah.
38;high;36;therapist;So, i'm wondering, have you noticed any problems from your drinking?
38;high;37;client;No. i guess, you know, the one- the one thing i can think of is, i mean, there will be evenings when i just kind of want to get my son to bed a little earlier, just so that i can have that alone time to unwind, you know, maybe-maybe smoke, have a couple drinks. um, but, i do feel guilty about that sometimes, because, i should enjoy spending time with my son, but, instead, you know, i'm just wanting to be by myself and relax, you know. so—
38;high;38;therapist;So, you've noticed that it's starting to call to you a little bit in the evenings.
38;high;39;client;Yeah.
38;high;40;therapist;And it's perhaps taking you away from things that are more important to you?
38;high;41;client;Yeah.
38;high;42;therapist;And it doesn't feel good?
38;high;43;client;No.
38;high;44;therapist;Yeah. and so, it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma there, because-- and i guess we should be clear, it's not the occasional drink that's an issue. um, it's-it's really the quantity of drinking, and-and whether your drinking is escalating and interfering with things that are, perhaps, more important.
38;high;45;client;Yeah.
38;high;46;therapist;And you've perhaps never seen it in that light before.
38;high;47;client;No. and, i-it's just, it's really hard to take in right now. i mean, yeah. i-i've never thought about it like this. and, so, you know, i-i do feel kind of worried.
38;high;48;therapist;I-it seems like it-it would be quite a hard pattern to change.
38;high;49;client;Yeah. i mean, i-it's part of my routine right now, and, you know, i-i don't want to sacrifice something i enjoy, but, you know, i'm trying really hard, you know, to be a good mom. i'm-i'm trying to, you know, go-go back to school. i'm trying to work. so, i don't know how i can do all of that if i don't have a way to enjoy myself or relax, you know?
38;high;50;therapist;So, it seems like it would be really difficult to change because it's something that's really important to you right now.
38;high;51;client;Yeah.
38;high;52;therapist;But on the other hand, it does sound like there are things that you- that you value that you don't want the drinking to interfere with.
38;high;53;client;Yeah.
38;high;54;therapist;So, i guess i'm wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you could cope with stress without relying on the drinking so much.
38;high;55;client;Well, you know, if there was some way that i could relieve some of my stress, i think i would feel better, and, you know, maybe at night, i wouldn't feel like i had to unwind in the same way.
38;high;56;therapist;So, if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-what would that be, for example?
40;high;0;therapist;Pretty good. it's been three months now.
40;high;1;client;Nice.
40;high;2;therapist;Um, and—
40;high;3;client;Since the-- since you used, uh-- since the last time you used meth, right?
40;high;4;therapist;Right.
40;high;5;client;Okay.
40;high;6;therapist;Right. it's been three months, and i've been doing pretty well.
40;high;7;client;Good.
40;high;8;therapist;Um, and i met a couple new friends.
40;high;9;client;Nice.
40;high;10;therapist;So—
40;high;11;client;So-so, uh, have-- last time we talked, you know, you were kind of cutting the-the ex-boyfriend out. this is because he was your dealer, so--
41;high;0;therapist;So, thank you for coming in today.
41;high;1;client;Yes.
41;high;2;therapist;How are you feeling today?
41;high;3;client;I feel great actually.
41;high;4;therapist;Yeah? good.
41;high;5;client;Yeah.
41;high;6;therapist;Good.
41;high;7;client;I feel good.
41;high;8;therapist;And so you did your clarifications, value clarifications-
41;high;9;client;Yeah.
41;high;10;therapist;And what are your top five?
41;high;11;client;Yes. it was a good, uh, experience for me. it was different. it was different than usual. there were several things that were different, and, uh, the number one value that i put was self-respect. and i-i don't even know if self-respect has ever been in my top five let alone my number one.
41;high;12;therapist;Really?
41;high;13;client;Yeah. and, um—
41;high;14;therapist;Do you have any idea why that is?
41;high;15;client;I do have an idea, i think, why that is. um, i think that there's been a few things that have happened recently and something that really came to my awareness, when i visited with my family, is that i have consistently through my whole life, probably, put other people first. and i have consistently, uh, almost not even considered myself in the equation. it was, uh, kind of sad in a way, at the time that i realized it. uh, i didn't realize how severe it actually was, but i was kind of glad that i realized it because i feel like it's never too late to change-
41;high;16;therapist;True.
41;high;17;client;-and i feel like i can- i can, uh, respect and value myself just as much as i have other people. i know that's important. and i feel like when i do that, i'm a better person for other people as well.
41;high;18;therapist;Mm-hmm. by not putting yourself on the back burner so much?
41;high;19;client;Yeah.
41;high;20;therapist;Yeah.
41;high;21;client;Because i get stressed, i get resentful, i get overwhelmed and, uh, out of- out of alignment, i guess, out of sorts.
41;high;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.
41;high;23;client;And i can't be the best- the best me possible.
41;high;24;therapist;For someone else?
41;high;25;client;Yeah.
41;high;26;therapist;For your family?
41;high;27;client;For myself or for someone else, either way, yeah.
41;high;28;therapist;You think it is so much of a fact that you put yourself on the back burner that you were neglecting yourself, or that you were putting others so much before you that you just didn't even think about yourself?
41;high;29;client;I-it's almost-- like, i think that some people might not even think that i put that first, but in my mind and my emotions, i was carrying concern about what other people think, and i was letting that concern dictate my actions. instead of letting my own values dictate my actions, i was letting what i thought other people wanted me to do to dictate my actions.
41;high;30;therapist;Wow.
41;high;31;client;And that's something that i had done for so long, literally since i was a child, that i didn't even know i was doing it.
41;high;32;therapist;There's so much of your-- part of your paradigm?
41;high;33;client;Yes, yes.
41;high;34;therapist;So, do you think sometimes you weren't even aware
41;high;35;client;Not aware at all. completely unaware. totally unaware, yeah. and so to me, i feel like it's a celebration. i used to, uh, moan and complain about my childhood and about all the things that i didn't get to have, and all the cruel, mean things that people said and did, and i felt-- i feel like i had this aha moment where i realized that i could be my own parent, and i could give myself the things that weren't given to me, now. i can give myself a voice. i can give myself an opinion. i can live like that, if i want to. nobody's stopping me from it, only me.
41;high;36;therapist;Yeah.
41;high;37;client;So, that's what i want to do.
41;high;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.and it's the first time in my life i haven't felt guilty for saying that.
41;high;39;client;The very first time that you can remember?
41;high;40;therapist;I would say so, yeah. i don't know if i've ever said that in front of people and not felt the least twinge of guilt for it. [chuckles]
41;high;41;client;That's not a selfish thing.
41;high;42;therapist;No-
41;high;43;client;Right.
41;high;44;therapist;-it's not, it's really not.
41;high;45;client;Cool, that's great.
41;high;46;therapist;Yeah.
41;high;47;client;Yeah. and so you felt you came about this change, and-and-and how does it make you feel?
41;high;48;therapist;Well, it makes me feel jubilant. it makes me feel joyful. it makes me feel hopeful. it makes me feel like i count, like i matter. uh, it makes me feel like i'm going to be able to do what i want to do with more joy and more passion, and less dread and a sense of responsibility, because one of the things that kind of happened along the way i really didn't notice, is that, um-- like, let's say for example i like being a teacher or i like being a teacher or i like being a counselor to a certain degree but because of all the shoulds and all of the sense of responsibility and all of the caring about what people think, i started to lose joy doing things i actually enjoy doing.
41;high;49;client;Because you're- felt so obligated.
41;high;50;therapist;Yes, because it turned into an obligation instead of just really really a sense of like you know passion you know. my passion is gone completely. i don't know i'm just happy to, i feel like i got back in touch with myself. it's like i was like lost for a while and now i'm like back again, yes, now i remember why i wanted to do this or like why this is important to me because it is actually one of my values to be and help, but it just has to be, uh, balanced.
42;high;0;therapist;I don't know, i'm just having a lot of hard trouble trying to lose the rest of the weight. um, right now, it's like no matter how much i try to exercise, run, or whatever, it doesn't matter like nothing else is coming off.
42;high;1;client;Right, so you've hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you're trying to do to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to be working on the scale?
42;high;2;therapist;No, and i don't know what i'm doing wrong because i keep trying the exercise but nothing's happening.
42;high;3;client;Right. so you feel like you're spinning your wheels, you're doing more exercising and it's not showing results on the scale?
42;high;4;therapist;Yes.
42;high;5;client;And you're not feeling so good about that?
42;high;6;therapist;No, and even when i'm coming home, like, i'll go to the gym and then i'm noticing nothing is happening and i'll come home and i try to talk to my mama about it or even my father, and no one even cares about it. like no one wants to support in it anyway.
42;high;7;client;Uh, so you feel like you're doing this all alone?
42;high;8;therapist;Yes.
43;high;0;therapist;Well, thank you, tanya, for meeting with me today and talking about this. so, there is something i'd like to ask you that we can kind of discuss in our conversation is what's one thing about yourself or something in your life that you'd like to change that maybe you've been feeling kind of ambivalent about?
43;high;1;client;Um, well, you know, i have a lot of anxiety, and so there's this test that i have to take. it's a big test and i've kind of been putting it off just 'cause i get very anxious. i don't trust in myself that i'm going to do good at it. um, and so that's something that's like always on my mind, it's been on my mind for many years and it's like, i gotta just do it. um, but i always stop myself from doing that because of the anxiety. and i just want to, i don't want to feel that way.
43;high;2;therapist;Yeah. this anxiety is this obstacle for you and it sounds like it, then you're just not feeling confident that you could do it and do it successfully to this exam.
43;high;3;client;Yeah.
43;high;4;therapist;And so, it's easier for you to just not do it.
43;high;5;client;Exactly. so, i just avoid it and put it off.
43;high;6;therapist;Yeah. so, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident. how confident are you that you feel you can manage your anxiety in regards to taking this exam?
43;high;7;client;Um, maybe like a four or five.
43;high;8;therapist;Okay. so, four or five. how combat, like, not like a two or three.
43;high;9;client;I mean, because i-i have it set up after like so many years, so i still have a ton of anxiety about it, but i think i'm like kind of making it, maybe that first step. and so that's why i would rate it as like a four or five because i'm making that first step, but it's still scary for me.
43;high;10;therapist;Yeah. yeah, and you also mentioned that you've actually made the appointment that you have to take this exam.
43;high;11;client;Yeah.
43;high;12;therapist;And before you've been putting it off.
43;high;13;client;Yes. and i already kind of put it off after s-scheduling it too. so, um, now i'm actually enjoying that because i-i already like changed date and everything. so now it's actually coming.
43;high;14;therapist;Okay. so, you've made this appointment before in the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you've rescheduled it.
43;high;15;client;Yes.
43;high;16;therapist;And this time, it seems like it's a little bit different this time. how come this time you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?
43;high;17;client;Um, well i think it's this kind of long time coming. i just need to do it and then i can figure out, if i don't pass, i have to wait three more months to do it. and then i just study for the next three months. and if i do, then i can have that weight lifted off my shoulders cause it's been all a lot of weight on me and i think about it every single day. and i'm just sick of thinking about it.
43;high;18;therapist;So that's really encouraging you thinking about how good you'll feel afterwards once it's done and taken.
43;high;19;client;Yeah. but then i do worry, you know, that negative talk that, you know, when you have anxiety. so then i worry about if i don't pass it, you know, like people are going to ask me how i did and if i don't pass it i'm gonna have to tell them, it's embarrassing for me. um, so that makes me really anxious.
43;high;20;therapist;Yeah. you kind of want to avoid that. yeah. have those other feelings that could come up and if you don't have.
43;high;21;client;Right.
43;high;22;therapist;I'd love to hear from you. when was the time in the past that you were feeling anxious about something and you actually did it and it turned out well?
43;high;23;client;Uh, i would say maybe like four or five years ago, um, i had to do a recording for work and i did not want to do it. i was trying to find every way that i can get out of during this recording. and, um, and then i played my recording and because of the way sometimes i carry myself, like not confident and very anxious, um, i think other people don't always believe in me.
43;high;24;therapist;And so, um, when i played the recording, it actually ended up being one of the best recordings and like my supervisor and our national consultant, they were very like shocked about it because it because of just was the way i carried myself. so i thought, i don't really like compliments that makes me, um, anxious too again people compliment me, but it was a nice feeling because i really didn't trust in myself. and to know that i did a good job.
43;high;25;client;Yeah.
43;high;26;therapist;Um, it made me feel good.
43;high;27;client;So, in that experience, it really built up your self-confidence and it almost not only changed the way you saw yourself, but maybe how other people saw you and you really, you liked that feeling.
43;high;28;therapist;Yeah, i did.
43;high;29;client;Yeah. and that must've been really brave for you to do something that seems really daunting at first, yet you were really successful at it.
44;low;0;therapist;Hey, hi, andrea. thanks for coming in today. so i don't know how much you've been told about why you're here, but basically, it's my job just to meet with all the students. i usually meet with you once or twice a semester. and i'm going to be talking to you kind of about your life and your goals and some behaviors that you might engage in and just the sorts of things like that.
44;low;1;client;Okay.
44;low;2;therapist;So why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourself?
44;low;3;client;Uh, well, my name is andrea, as you know, i'm, uh, in the marching band. i play the tenor sax.
44;low;4;therapist;Oh.
44;low;5;client;Yeah. i'm involved in music. so i'm also in the jazz band, the wind ensemble, and um, yeah, that's about—
44;low;6;therapist;Okay.
44;low;7;client;I'm an ib student.
44;low;8;therapist;Okay. how long ago did you start playing saxophone?
44;low;9;client;Well, saxophone. i started about four years ago, but i've been involved in music for about 10 years now, so.
44;low;10;therapist;Wow. that's a long time. what other instruments?
44;low;11;client;I started off on the violin first.
44;low;12;therapist;No kidding.
44;low;13;client;So i played that for like six years, once a clarinet, dabbled here and there with different things. and then i found the one- the one for me.
44;low;14;therapist;That's awesome. and you play tenor sax?
44;low;15;client;Yeah, the tenor sax.
44;low;16;therapist;Wow. and how long have you been in marching band?
44;low;17;client;Marching band since freshman year. so like three years.
44;low;18;therapist;Okay. couple of years. great. and how do you like marching band?
44;low;19;client;It's fun. it's a- it's a lot of work, long summers taught, but it's fun.
44;low;20;therapist;What are your favorite parts about it?
44;low;21;client;Oh, i really like the-the group setting.
44;low;22;therapist;Oh, okay.
44;low;23;client;You know, getting to work with my other classmates and things like that. and putting on this entire show-
44;low;24;therapist;Uh-huh.
44;low;25;client;-it's very exciting, very exhilarating once you're in competition.
44;low;26;therapist;Okay.
44;low;27;client;It's very cool.
44;low;28;therapist;Cool. and do you have a lot of friends who are in band with you or-
44;low;29;client;Yeah.
44;low;30;therapist;Friends outside of band or?
44;low;31;client;I have, um, you know, i have two-two separate groups. i have my friends from class and then my friends from bra-- from band.
44;low;32;therapist;Okay.
44;low;33;client;So.
44;low;34;therapist;Great. and then, um, tell me a little bit about your family?
44;low;35;client;Oh, well i have one brother he's older than me, about nine years older than me.
44;low;36;therapist;Oh, wow.
44;low;37;client;And, uh, my parents and my dog. [laughs]
44;low;38;therapist;Okay. what kind of dog do you have?
44;low;39;client;He's a golden retriever.
44;low;40;therapist;Oh, nice.
44;low;41;client;Charlie.
44;low;42;therapist;Charlie.
44;low;43;client;He's a big boy. yeah.
44;low;44;therapist;Oh, cute. have you had him a long time?
44;low;45;client;Yeah. he's about eight years old now.
44;low;46;therapist;Oh gosh. yeah. okay. very cool. and what are your plans for after high school?
44;low;47;client;Uh, well, i'm planning on going to school. i'd like to become a doctor one day, so.
44;low;48;therapist;Wow.
44;low;49;client;I'm interested in psychology, psychiatry, something like that, so.
44;low;50;therapist;You've got big dreams.
44;low;51;client;Yeah.
44;low;52;therapist;Cool. all right. have you started thinking about schools or majors? i guess you're thinking about psychology as a major.
44;low;53;client;Yeah, psychology, i haven't really thought too about which school, i mean, i-
44;low;54;therapist;Right.
44;low;55;client;Everyone wants to shoot for the ivy leagues, so [chuckles]
44;low;56;therapist;All right. and how about your grades?
44;low;57;client;Uh, they're pretty good, you know, high three-point somethings.
44;low;58;therapist;Okay. good. very good. all right. well, what are the kinds of things do you do for fun on weekends?
44;low;59;client;Uh, i usually go out with my friends. uh, we'll go to the movies or we'll most likely we'll just meet up at someone's house-
44;low;60;therapist;Mm-hmm.
44;low;61;client;And just hang out and things.
44;low;62;therapist;Mm-hmm. when you're hanging out, is there ever alcohol?
44;low;63;client;Sometimes, [chuckles] i'm gonna be honest sometimes.
44;low;64;therapist;Uh-huh so how often do you think you drink alcohol?
44;low;65;client;Um, depending on how much schoolwork there is when there's not, it might be like every other weekend or like three weekends out of the month or something like that.
44;low;66;therapist;Oh, so you're drinking a lot?
44;low;67;client;A little, yeah.
44;low;68;therapist;Okay. and how much are you drinking on the days that you're-- on the days that you drink?
44;low;69;client;Um, i don't, we don't get blackout drunk or anything. it's more of like a little tipsy kind of thing.
44;low;70;therapist;Mm-hmm.
44;low;71;client;I have gotten blackout drunk before-
44;low;72;therapist;Mm-hmm.
44;low;73;client;-but i kind of did that, learned my lesson, didn't like it.
44;low;74;therapist;Got it. so you've-you've had some pretty heavy drinking. what-what do you think is the most you've ever had?
44;low;75;client;Like how many drinks?
44;low;76;therapist;Yeah.
44;low;77;client;Um, it was a good amount. it was the first time i ever drank and it was like three or four cups, but it was mixing different things.
44;low;78;therapist;Okay, so you don't even know.
44;low;79;client;So, i'm not-- yeah.
44;low;80;therapist;Okay. so, and then your friends drink too?
44;low;81;client;Yeah. yes. not all of them, but some of them do.
44;low;82;therapist;Okay. and how much do they typically drink?
44;low;83;client;More or less the same amount. so right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup after that one time, but sometimes one or two, but they can be kind of heavy.
44;low;84;therapist;Okay, so it's one cup, but it's not-not one drink.
44;low;85;client;Oh, it's a red, you know, typical. yeah.
44;low;86;therapist;It has a lot of alcohol in it.
44;low;87;client;Mm-hmm.
44;low;88;therapist;Okay. um, so gosh, you're-you're actually really drinking quite a lot. um, you know, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group.
44;low;89;client;Mm-hmm.
44;low;90;therapist;So, is that surprising to you?
44;low;91;client;A little bit.
44;low;92;therapist;Yeah. um, so we call it high-risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that. so, you know, things like, um, having car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. have you thought about those things?
44;low;93;client;Not too much, to be honest. i-i've always thought since it's, you know, within my small group of friends-
44;low;94;therapist;Uh-huh.
44;low;95;client;-and we usually sleep over each other's house, we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving, and possibly sexual assaults and things like that.
44;low;96;therapist;Uh-huh.
44;low;97;client;But i haven't really thought about possible alcoholism or anything.
44;low;98;therapist;Okay. so it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. um, and yeah. okay. so, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. because i think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this.
44;low;99;client;Okay.
44;low;100;therapist;So, um, do you think you could quit drinking or?
44;low;101;client;Yeah, i think i could. i don't need it. for instance, it-it is-- it is used as a kind of, like, let's get the party going.
44;low;102;therapist;Uh-huh.
45;high;0;therapist;Hi, mary, how was your day?
45;high;1;client;Fine. where do you want me to sign?
45;high;2;therapist;Well, you can sign right there. seems like you're not in the mood to talk today.
45;high;3;client;Not really.
45;high;4;therapist;Okay. you know it seems like you had uh, a day at school. i noticed that uh, you missed your first hour of class today as well.
45;high;5;client;Yeah, whatever. i just, yeah.
45;high;6;therapist;It seems like that doesn't-isn't really a concern for you at this time?
45;high;7;client;It's just like the same thing every day like, i don't really know why. like um, so i signed your paper, why are asking me all these questions?
45;high;8;therapist;So you're kind of wondering what the point of these visits are, me coming to your house.
45;high;9;client;Yup.
45;high;10;therapist;Okay. would it be okay with you if i kind of explained again kind of what this program is about?
45;high;11;client;I guess so.
45;high;12;therapist;You know that i will be stopping by every day just to make sure that you're here and following and-and responding to your gps and making sure that that's charged up every day and that, um, if you're leaving the house without permission, that we will be aware of that as well. um, and kinda just to get to know you as well when i come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's kind of my role as your caseworker is just to-to monitor your day-to-day stuff.
45;high;13;client;So you just wanna know my business?
45;high;14;therapist;It does kinda come off as nosy at times i'm sure.
45;high;15;client;Mm-hmm.
45;high;16;therapist;I know uh, some clients have struggled with understanding that i really do care about you. and you know that when we first met that you had expressed a goal of, um, getting off this program as quickly as possible.
45;high;17;client;Mm-hmm.
45;high;18;therapist;So i know just kinda being here when you need to be here is one way of doing that.
45;high;19;client;Mm-hmm.
45;high;20;therapist;Yet you still can seem kind of annoyed that this is something that we still have to do.
45;high;21;client;Yeah. i mean i guess i'll be here if i have to be but i can't make any promises that i won't leave.
45;high;22;therapist;So you're still kinda concerned that you're not quite sure if you will be able to do this successfully?
45;high;23;client;No, 'cause this just kinda feels like why do you need to know my business? why do you care?
45;high;24;therapist;Um, and-and i'm sure that does seem kind of confusing too 'cause i'm sure you've got a lot of other people involved in your life right now with the courts i'm sure, i know that your mom is concerned about you as well and there's this one other person kinda checking in on you as well.
45;high;25;client;Mm-hmm.
45;high;26;therapist;I'm sure it's pretty overwhelming.
45;high;27;client;It's just like a lot.
45;high;28;therapist;Mm-hmm.
45;high;29;client;And you feel like there's all these rules.
45;high;30;therapist;Yeah. and there is and i'm sure that it is really struggling at times too.
46;high;0;therapist;So, jacob, everything looks very normal on your physical exam. do you have any questions for me?
46;high;1;client;No.
46;high;2;therapist;Okay. i see that you filled out our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. is it okay if we go through this together?
46;high;3;client;Sure.
46;high;4;therapist;Okay. what we talk about is confidential. i only tell your parents about what we say if you give your permission or if i become worried about a danger to-to you or to someone else. does that make sense?
46;high;5;client;Yeah.
46;high;6;therapist;Okay. so, let's take a look. so i see that you have marked that you sometimes use alcohol, and that you have used alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself or fit in. do you mind telling me a little bit more about your alcohol use?
46;high;7;client;It's not a big deal. sometimes with my friends, we'll drink a few beers and when we're hanging out or when we're at a party, and sometimes rum and cokes.
46;high;8;therapist;Okay, so how many do you usually have at a time?
46;high;9;client;Um, three or four, probably. i don't keep track.
46;high;10;therapist;Okay. and how often?
46;high;11;client;Um, probably about once or twice a month.
46;high;12;therapist;Okay. so, you drink with friends, sort of three or four beers or mixed drinks, one or two times a month. how long have you been doing that?
46;high;13;client;Probably since last october.
46;high;14;therapist;So, for about six months. i'm curious. what do you like about drinking alcohol?
46;high;15;client;What do i like about it?
46;high;16;therapist;Yeah.
46;high;17;client;Um, i don't know. it's just fun to drink with my friends, like when we're at a party at someone else's house, and we're drinking with other people that we don't know. it tastes good.
46;high;18;therapist;Okay. so, it sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun when you're drinking with friends and you like the taste.
46;high;19;client;Mm-hmm.
46;high;20;therapist;Okay. i'm also curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?
46;high;21;client;Um, i don't like when i get sick in the mornings 'cause of hangovers and-
46;high;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.
46;high;23;client;-when i start throwing up, that's not- i don't like that.
46;high;24;therapist;Have you ever experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up and you don't remember what happened?
46;high;25;client;No, but that happened to someone i know, though.
46;high;26;therapist;Okay. and have you had any problems related to-to your drinking alcohol, like at home or school or somewhere else?
46;high;27;client;Um, one time i missed first period of school 'cause i had a hangover and i was late getting up.
46;high;28;therapist;Mm-hmm.
46;high;29;client;Mm, mom got mad at me 'cause i wouldn't get out of bed and she said she knew i had a hangover.
46;high;30;therapist;Mm-hmm. have you told your mother that you drink with your friends?
46;high;31;client;No, but i got grounded for two weeks after that. [chuckles]
46;high;32;therapist;So more negative things about your drinking, like getting into trouble with your mom and missing a class at school when you had a hangover?
46;high;33;client;Yeah, but i only missed school once.
46;high;34;therapist;Okay. i see on the questionnaire that you have not ridden in a car with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven a car, um, after you've been drinking. is that correct?
46;high;35;client;Yeah.
49;high;0;therapist;All right, catherine, welcome back. i'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, i-i remembered last time i asked you what you were thinking about coming, but-
49;high;1;client;Mm.
49;high;2;therapist;What was different this time and your thoughts about coming?
49;high;3;client;I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why i'm here.
49;high;4;therapist;Yeah.
49;high;5;client;I guess, i'm-- it made me think about how much money i have been losing recently. so, yeah. i'm happier to be here. [chuckles]
49;high;6;therapist;Okay, okay. so, there's a shift from last time?
49;high;7;client;Mm-hmm.
49;high;8;therapist;"Yeah. yeah. my sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. that's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- after last time, i thought, you know, ""here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together-"
49;high;9;client;Mm.
49;high;10;therapist;"-and, uh--"" so, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really."
49;high;11;client;Mm-hmm.
49;high;12;therapist;So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family.
49;high;13;client;Mm-hmm.
49;high;14;therapist;Yeah. so, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so i'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles?
49;high;15;client;Yeah. i'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles]
49;high;16;therapist;Yeah. yeah.
49;high;17;client;Yeah.
49;high;18;therapist;Yeah. yeah.
49;high;19;client;Yeah.
49;high;20;therapist;"Yeah, so how-how-- you know, like-- 'cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, ""oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable."" so, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? how have you managed those in the past?"
49;high;21;client;Hmm. i don't know, i probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles]
49;high;22;therapist;Yeah. yeah. so, how would i know if we were talking and you were blocking off? what would i notice, uh, in our session together?
49;high;23;client;Yeah, um. i'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] um, i don't know, probably fidget.
49;high;24;therapist;Yeah?
49;high;25;client;That's why i am still a bit—
49;high;26;therapist;Yeah, that's okay.
49;high;27;client;[chuckles]
49;high;28;therapist;So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because i might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? it would be really helpful if—
49;high;29;client;When i'm feeling uncomfortable?
49;high;30;therapist;"Yeah, yeah. if you could just say, ""ken, hi, i am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,"" that would be really helpful."
49;high;31;client;Okay.
49;high;32;therapist;Yeah?
49;high;33;client;Mm-hmm.
49;high;34;therapist;Yeah, thanks for that, okay. so, let's think about the-- it has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.
49;high;35;client;Mm.
49;high;36;therapist;So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort?
49;high;37;client;[sighs] i suppose it's really serious if i wanna get out of my-my-my debt.
49;high;38;therapist;Yeah, okay.
49;high;39;client;Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so-
49;high;40;therapist;Yeah.
49;high;41;client;-i suppose, i've gotta sort it out myself.
49;high;42;therapist;Okay. so, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? yeah.
49;high;43;client;About 80. [chuckles]
49;high;44;therapist;About 80? right up there, yeah, yeah? and another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life?
49;high;45;client;I'm gonna say, i'm completely confident.
49;high;46;therapist;Yeah? but, what would-
49;high;47;client;Yes.
49;high;48;therapist;-your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? where does your confidence sit?
49;high;49;client;What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles]
49;high;50;therapist;Well, to get it sorted. not necessarily to stop. but we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, i don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out.
49;high;51;client;It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know?
49;high;52;therapist;Mm.
49;high;53;client;When i went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and i went and hit a bit of a flutter-
49;high;54;therapist;Hmm.
49;high;55;client;-so, you know, i think i'm a bit weird if i just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles]
49;high;56;therapist;Yeah. yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them?
49;high;57;client;Yeah.
49;high;58;therapist;Yep. okay, okay. and-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? where-where were you with—
49;high;59;client;Oh, i had to stop halfway 'cause i'd ran out of money. [chuckles]
49;high;60;therapist;Okay. okay. okay. yeah, yeah. so, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford-
49;high;61;client;Mm-hmm.
49;high;62;therapist;-'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, i think?
49;high;63;client;Yeah.
49;high;64;therapist;Yeah? yeah. yep. so, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems?
49;high;65;client;Mm-hmm.
49;high;66;therapist;Yeah? yeah.
49;high;67;client;Yeah.
49;high;68;therapist;There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that?
49;high;69;client;I don't know, but i'd like to get back on track, but—
49;high;70;therapist;Yeah.
49;high;71;client;Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles]
49;high;72;therapist;Mm.
49;high;73;client;I don't mind traveling, and, you know, i've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and i'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards-
49;high;74;therapist;Yeah.
49;high;75;client;-so i won't be doing any traveling any time soon.
49;high;76;therapist;Okay. so, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. so, what's-what's your dreams? what are your dreams? where do you wanna be in five years' time? where does catherine wanna be? what do you wanna be doing? what are your dreams?
49;high;77;client;Maybe i wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles]
49;high;78;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
49;high;79;client;I don't know. kids maybe, but-
49;high;80;therapist;Okay.
49;high;81;client;-i'm not gonna- [sighs] i'm not gonna make a decent mom the way i am, at the moment, am i? so i probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] i'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate.
49;high;82;therapist;Okay, okay. so, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps.
49;high;83;client;Yeah.
49;high;84;therapist;"Yeah? yeah. ""do i continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,"" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- i was speaking to last time-"
49;high;85;client;[chuckles]
49;high;86;therapist;"-wasn't that-- is that right? yeah? so, ""do i live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am i got some other dreams to follow?"" so, they're hard calls to make. and-and it all-- and there are no three ways. we will have to make those calls a"
49;high;87;client;Mm.
49;high;88;therapist;And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? yeah?
49;high;89;client;Yeah.
49;high;90;therapist;When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? which-which feels best? party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? which-which direction feels best for you at this point?
49;high;91;client;Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles]
49;high;92;therapist;I don't know.
49;high;93;client;I don't know. it's been fun up to now-
49;high;94;therapist;What's your hunch? yeah.
49;high;95;client;-but i really do wanna travel, so.
49;high;96;therapist;Yeah, yeah. where in particular? you've got any ideas about what—
49;high;97;client;Um, egypt, always been, yeah.
49;high;98;therapist;Egypt?
49;high;99;client;Yeah.
49;high;100;therapist;Uh, what's that about egypt, that, uh?
49;high;101;client;Oh, i just think it's just fascinating.
49;high;102;therapist;Yeah?
49;high;103;client;Yeah. just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and-
49;high;104;therapist;Oh.
49;high;105;client;-somewhere i've always wanted to go.
49;high;106;therapist;Yeah.
49;high;107;client;It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles].
49;high;108;therapist;No, that's true.
50;high;0;therapist;So, uh, i guess the issue is that, um, you know, my doctor seems to think that my-my blood pressure's a little high, but i really don't think that there's a problem. and you know, i eat really well. um. and, you know, she suggested that, um, i watch my caffeine but really, caffeine is not a problem for me.
50;high;1;client;Okay. um, but we were talking a little bit earlier-- earlier in our conversation, you had said that you did feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation. so it's a little bit of, i'm not sure of what-- um, so where are we? did-did you-- do you feel like you do have some agitation out of coffee, or is it just no problem at all?
50;high;2;therapist;Well, you know, sometimes it makes me a little jittery and, you know, i have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of my co-workers, but-- and-and working, um, in the hospital, they don't really look so highly on-on going the bathroom frequently. but you know, it-it keeps me awake, it keeps me aware, it-it makes me more able to like, you know, do my job better. and so i really don't see that it's a-it's a real issue.
50;high;3;client;Yeah.
50;high;4;therapist;Um, you know, and-and-- i mean, maybe my blood pressure is a little high, but—
50;high;5;client;Yeah. so let me see if i had this. so y- so you got some positives, the-the awareness, and then you feel kinda on your game?
50;high;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.
50;high;7;client;Um, and then there's some negatives with, um, you know, your-your co-workers, um, that they don't, you know-- then your boss may not want you, you know, checking out-
50;high;8;therapist;Right.
50;high;9;client;-on the hospital floor, you know, for frequently.
50;high;10;therapist;Gotta stay on, yeah.
50;high;11;client;Yeah, yeah, and then the blood pressure thing. does that sound about right?
50;high;12;therapist;Yeah, yeah. well, you know, and sometimes, like i said, it does kind of make me a little jittery and, um, i don't know. i-i-i'm not- i'm not as happy and relaxed as i normally am. but you know, i-i really like it, and-and like i said, it makes me more aware of what's going on and-and i'm-- i-i feel like i'm much more observant.
50;high;13;client;Yeah. how about frequency? do you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking?
50;high;14;therapist;Yeah. i have about four cups a day.
50;high;15;client;Okay. okay. and that feels about right to you?
50;high;16;therapist;Yeah. i mean, i've-- i mean, it's the co-workers that-that work at night. gosh, they bring in a carafe.
50;high;17;client;Mm-hmm.
50;high;18;therapist;And, uh, i-i can only imagine-
50;high;19;client;Yeah.
50;high;20;therapist;What-what their bodies are like.
50;high;21;client;Yeah, yeah. what would happen if you-- if you looked at, maybe reducing that with that habit? would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic?
50;high;22;therapist;Reducing it, like-- what do you mean?
50;high;23;client;The number. just the number.
50;high;24;therapist;Yeah, yeah but, i mean, how-how much are we talking?
50;high;25;client;I don't-- you tell me. i mean, um, you're-you're drinking four a day.
50;high;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.
50;high;27;client;Um--
50;high;28;therapist;You're probably-- you know, because i-i gotta have that morning cup, i really-- you know i really like waking up and-and that whole ritual. the, um-- you know, making the coffee and-
50;high;29;client;Yeah.
51;high;0;therapist;Tell me what you know about the flu shot?
51;high;1;client;Uh, well, i know the flu can be pretty bad, but i'm in pretty good health, so i don't really feel like i need it. uh, it's kind of just more for old people, right?
51;high;2;therapist;Mm, um, so you're thinking it's really just for people who are-are vulnerable to illness?
51;high;3;client;Yeah.
51;high;4;therapist;Would it be okay if i shared a little more information with you about the flu vaccine and the importance of it?
51;high;5;client;Okay.
51;high;6;therapist;So you're right that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean that you would probably do okay if you got the flu. but we do know that the elderly are more at risk, pregnant people, babies are at risk of having serious complications from the flu, and by you getting the vaccine, that helps prevent you from passing it on to other people.
51;high;7;client;Okay.
51;high;8;therapist;So having shared that information with you, how do you feel about the idea of the flu vaccine?
53;low;0;therapist;Hi, laura. so, thanks for coming in. i'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about. so, basically, i'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester. and we're going to talk about, you know, whatever's kind of going on in your life. i'll ask you some questions about, you know, your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things. and then we'll talk a little bit about, you know, different behaviors and-and stuff like that. and so, it's-it's pretty casual, pretty informal, just sort of a chance for me to get to know you if that's all right.
53;low;1;client;Okay.
53;low;2;therapist;Okay. why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself?
53;low;3;client;Okay. um, my name is laura and i'm 17 and i'm a senior in high school.
53;low;4;therapist;Okay. and what do you like to do for fun?
53;low;5;client;Um, mostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends, things like that.
53;low;6;therapist;Mm-hmm, and when you and your friends are hanging out, and what- what do you do? do you go to football games, go to parties?
53;low;7;client;Uh, yeah, if it's school-related, maybe like a game or two, or go to the mall, like, to shop or go to the movies or something, and at night, maybe like a party or something if someone's throwing.
53;low;8;therapist;Okay. and what kind of hobbies do you have?
53;low;9;client;Um, i like to read and i like to go outside and, like, take walks and, like, hike and stuff. i'm very outdoorsy, so-
53;low;10;therapist;Oh, cool. what are your plans for after high school?
53;low;11;client;Well, i plan to apply to college and maybe, you know, have a good career and something like that, hopefully.
53;low;12;therapist;That's great. what do you think you'll study?
53;low;13;client;Well, i'm-i'm looking at the journalism, maybe pre-law.
53;low;14;therapist;Oh, neat.
53;low;15;client;-which is a little different, but-
53;low;16;therapist;Yeah, that's great. that's a really good goal.
53;low;17;client;Yeah. thanks.
53;low;18;therapist;It's, uh, hard work to get into law school. are you doing well in school? what kind of grades do you get?
53;low;19;client;Yeah, i'm doing okay. i'm getting mostly a's and b's, so i'm pretty good, i'm okay.
53;low;20;therapist;Okay. what classes are you not getting a's and b's in?
53;low;21;client;Um, i think all my grades are a's and b's, so, yeah.
53;low;22;therapist;Okay. and do you know where you're going to apply to college?
53;low;23;client;Um, i'm not sure yet, but i'm looking into schools like in the area, so maybe, i don't know, maybe i'll leave home or something.
53;low;24;therapist;Okay. cool. and, you know, what made you decide maybe law school or-or journalism?
53;low;25;client;Um, well, i'm definitely not a math or science person, so i started off by there that i started looking at careers that maybe i would like. so-
53;low;26;therapist;Okay. great. sounds like you have, like i said, really good goals and you're working hard in school. um, you said that when you're going out with your friends, you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties, so do you drink alcohol?
53;low;27;client;Um, not really. maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most.
53;low;28;therapist;Okay. and how often do you think you drink?
53;low;29;client;Um, maybe like once or twice a month at the most.
53;low;30;therapist;Mm-hmm, so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol?
53;low;31;client;Yeah.
53;low;32;therapist;Okay, and so that's maybe like 20 times a year.
53;low;33;client;Possibly, yeah.
53;low;34;therapist;So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then?
53;low;35;client;Yeah, i guess you can say that.
53;low;36;therapist;Okay. what do you think is the most you've ever had?
53;low;37;client;Um, just two drinks at a party at the most. i don't-- i don't like to drink a lot. i don't-- getting drunk is not something that appeals to me. so, i just have, like, a drink in my hand, so my friends won't bug me about not drinking. it's just like to look like i'm actually doing something. most of- a lot of the time, i don't even drink at all. so-
53;low;38;therapist;But you've been drunk before?
53;low;39;client;Um, no, not really, maybe tipsy, but not like drunk.
53;low;40;therapist;Okay. um, so the most you've ever, ever had is two drinks in a day.
53;low;41;client;Yeah.
53;low;42;therapist;Okay. interesting. so, do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?
53;low;43;client;Um, yeah, yeah.
53;low;44;therapist;Okay. um, so one of the things that, you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. so, um, you know, that's actually a really big problem. and even around here, we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident. so that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing, all right? have you ever done that? have you ever gotten in the car-
53;low;45;client;No, i have drunk-driven and never got in a car with a drunk driver.
53;low;46;therapist;Okay. uh, how much do your friends drink?
53;low;47;client;Um, i mean, i have some friends that drink some more than others, like, my close group of friends don't really drink as much because i'm not really interested in that, but i know that there are people that drink a lot more.
53;low;48;therapist;Okay. what about at these parties you're going to, are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?
53;low;49;client;Yeah. there are kids that drink a lot more than i do. definitely, yeah.
53;low;50;therapist;And do you hang out with them?
53;low;51;client;Not really closely, like, i know who they are and i'll say hi, but not-- they're not really, like, close friends of mine.
53;low;52;therapist;Mm-hmm, so, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. did you know that?
53;low;53;client;Um, yeah. that makes sense.
53;low;54;therapist;Yeah, so, there, i mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, people, um, you know, will fall or, um, you know, break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and falling down or, you know, as a girl, it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted.
53;low;55;client;Yeah.
53;low;56;therapist;You know, especially if you've been drinking, then, you know, you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you. did- have you thought about that?
53;low;57;client;Yeah, yeah, i have. that's, uh, one of the main reasons that i don't like to drink that much.
53;low;58;therapist;Mm-hmm.
53;low;59;client;So-
53;low;60;therapist;And then, um, you know, people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too. um, also, you know, there have been a lot of kids, even at this school, who've gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on facebook-
53;low;61;client;Yeah.
53;low;62;therapist;And then their parents find out or the school finds out and, you know, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol, and really can get you into trouble, and it could put your whole college career in jeopardy. have you thought about that?
53;low;63;client;Yeah. definitely, yeah.
54;high;0;therapist;Oh, hello scott.
54;high;1;client;Hi.
54;high;2;therapist;Um, we were talking a little bit earlier, and you said you wanted to talk about exercising.
54;high;3;client;I do.
54;high;4;therapist;What's going on with that?
54;high;5;client;Well, i just can't seem to get back in the gym. i don't wanna-- i-i used to work out quite a bit, and in the last, i dunno, couple of years i've just-- i stopped going. i got busy, and now i'm out of the habit, and i-i really, i dunno, i feel like i need to get back.
54;high;6;therapist;Well, i mean, i think you just need to maybe sit down and write down a list of reasons why you need to get back to the gym, and then on the other side of the list, put down, you know, um, ideas about what's going to help you get there.
54;high;7;client;Okay. um. all right. um—
54;high;8;therapist;What gym do you belong to?
54;high;9;client;Uh, i belong to the-the sport fitness center.
54;high;10;therapist;Okay. and-and how far away is it from your house?
54;high;11;client;Just a couple of miles.
54;high;12;therapist;Just a couple of miles. mm. so you-- you know, you could, like, ride your bike or walk there, and it would be [unintelligible 00:01:12] too.
54;high;13;client;If i walked that far, i probably wouldn't even need to go to the gym, right?
54;high;14;therapist;Well, i don't know about that. um. that-- you know, it's really important that you get your, um, not just your cardiovascular-- that's a good idea for the cardiovascular, but also, you know, your, um, weightlifting, the [inaudible 00:01:32] [crosstalk]
54;high;15;client;[inaudible 00:01:33] training.
54;high;16;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
54;high;17;client;It-it-it would be important.
54;high;18;therapist;Yeah. so why-why do you want to-- what do you wanna do with that? you want to look different, or--?
54;high;19;client;Well, i-i-i-i would feel better. my-- i'd-i'd be able to wear more my clothes. i've been growing around the middle and i'd like to, uh, you know, go back to where i was, you know, get into a 34, 36 waist, you know.
54;high;20;therapist;Okay.
54;high;21;client;I-i'm more comfortable-- i feel better. i think that's the main thing.
54;high;22;therapist;Okay. yeah, because your-your health really, to me, it's more important than your-your looks. i mean, don't get me wrong, i understand what you're saying, but, you know, it'd be great to get back in those jeans, but—
54;high;23;client;Yeah, yeah. it-it-it-- i-i am- i'm not getting any younger than i [unintelligible 00:02:18]
56;high;0;therapist;Hi, mrs. smith. i'm denise. i'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with dr. fields and the rest of the team. and, um, i know you were here to see dr. fields today, and i-i just wanted to let you know, i usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. and, uh, so i'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home.
56;high;1;client;Pretty good.
56;high;2;therapist;Yeah?
56;high;3;client;Yeah. um, i'm glad to be there.
56;high;4;therapist;Yeah. what are you really glad about?
56;high;5;client;Uh, well, i'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home.
56;high;6;therapist;Yeah.
56;high;7;client;Yeah. and my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- it's-it's good. it's good to be home.
56;high;8;therapist;I know, i-i understand that it was really-- that was your goal. that was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and i know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the tai chi and how's-how's that going?
56;high;9;client;Well, um. i-i didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or tai chi, actually.
56;high;10;therapist;So, i'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. you look a little, um, down.
56;high;11;client;Yeah. well, um. actually, i-i had a little semi fall, i didn't fall down, i didn't fall down completely but i-i did-- i guess i still had the wobblies and i was hoping that the physical therapy and the tai chi would be- get me further along than it has, and i-i still don't have the balance. so, i'm thinking that maybe i was pushing too hard, that maybe i should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that.
56;high;12;therapist;Mm. so you've been working really hard-
56;high;13;client;Yeah.
56;high;14;therapist;-through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home.
56;high;15;client;Yes.
56;high;16;therapist;And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the tai chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things.
56;high;17;client;Yeah.
56;high;18;therapist;And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard?
56;high;19;client;Yeah, yeah.
56;high;20;therapist;Yeah.
56;high;21;client;So i'm-i'm-i cut back, and i-i don't know if i should really even continue the tai chi because it's-it's very demanding.
56;high;22;therapist;Yeah, yeah. it's a lot of work.
56;high;23;client;Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah.
56;high;24;therapist;What are you concerned about?
56;high;25;client;That i'll- that i'll fall again.
56;high;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.
56;high;27;client;I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if i don't move around so much, there's less chance that i will.
56;high;28;therapist;Yeah, yeah, yeah. and- so you don't want to hurt yourself.
56;high;29;client;No.
56;high;30;therapist;And what are- what are your concerns about-- it doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall.
56;high;31;client;No, i didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe i'm doing too much.
56;high;32;therapist;Mm-hmm.
56;high;33;client;Yeah.
56;high;34;therapist;Yeah. and, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something-
56;high;35;client;Well, yeah, if i- if i lose my balance and fall down, i could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then i wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what i want. i want to stay home. so i want to do what i have to do to-to-to stay home.
56;high;36;therapist;And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down.
56;high;37;client;Yeah. [laughs] yes, you've put it very well, hunker down-
56;high;38;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
56;high;39;client;Watch the tv and pet my dog. i-i, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, i think- i think maybe, um, yeah, i was-was going- pushing too hard.
56;high;40;therapist;Mm-hmm. mm-hmm.
56;high;41;client;And i'm not sure about the tai chi anymore. i-i think the physical therapy, i can understand that, but i'm not so sure about the tai chi.
56;high;42;therapist;Yeah. so the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which-
56;high;43;client;Yeah.
56;high;44;therapist;Might have probably helped you break your fall this time.
56;high;45;client;Right, right.
56;high;46;therapist;Um, i'm wondering what you remember about what-what dr. fields said about the tai chi in relationship to falls. did she talk with you about that?
56;high;47;client;She did. sh-- yeah, that's right, that's right. she said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. i think she's- i forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself.
56;high;48;therapist;Yeah.
56;high;49;client;Yeah.
56;high;50;therapist;"Yeah. so you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- ""look, and i did this, i was doing my tai chi, and all of a sudden, i- here, look at this, i fall."""
56;high;51;client;"That's a strong word, isn't it, ""betrayed"". um, wow. a little, but-but i-i know, i know that it's true. i mean, my friend who does tai chi, she just- she loves it. maybe it's just not for me, you know."
56;high;52;therapist;Right.
56;high;53;client;But, um-
56;high;54;therapist;So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. and i'd like to work with you as i know dr. fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home-
56;high;55;client;Right.
56;high;56;therapist;And to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe.
56;high;57;client;Yeah.
56;high;58;therapist;Wh-what do you think about that?
56;high;59;client;Absolutely, that- because i don't- now i'm-i'm feeling-
56;high;60;therapist;Yeah.
56;high;61;client;-really a little frightened that what if- what if i fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and i'm lying there for two days, you know. i may have heard about that.
56;high;62;therapist;Yeah, right.
56;high;63;client;So, um, 'cause i am alone.
56;high;64;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
56;high;65;client;So—
56;high;66;therapist;So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and--
56;high;67;client;Yeah.
56;high;68;therapist;What thoughts do you have about that? what have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have?
56;high;69;client;Well, the-- i think that there's some things that could be done to-- i know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? um, is there any- anything else that i could do just to communicate if-if-
56;high;70;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
56;high;71;client;If something does happen?
56;high;72;therapist;Yeah, yeah. i know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that i've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button.
56;high;73;client;I think i saw something like that on tv.
56;high;74;therapist;Mm-hmm.
56;high;75;client;Is it- does it really work?
56;high;76;therapist;It does really work.
56;high;77;client;'cause you know that they sell so much stuff on tv, it's like you could- [crosstalk]
56;high;78;therapist;Right. right.
56;high;79;client;It's crazy, it's crazy.
56;high;80;therapist;No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips.
56;high;81;client;Yeah. i guess so, feeling a little scared-
56;high;82;therapist;Mm-hmm.
56;high;83;client;-you know, about that happening and-
56;high;84;therapist;Yeah.
56;high;85;client;So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes.
56;high;86;therapist;Mm-hmm.
56;high;87;client;Like i don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? i really don't. do i have to?
56;high;88;therapist;We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe.
56;high;89;client;Yeah.
56;high;90;therapist;So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. what do you think? the lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider.
56;high;91;client;That i will definitely- i definitely wanna do that.
56;high;92;therapist;Mm.
56;high;93;client;I definitely wanna do that.
56;high;94;therapist;Mm-hmm. what else do you think it would take for you to feel safe?
56;high;95;client;Well, i- maybe they-they-- when i first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that i should exercise and-and, um, i guess i could-- maybe support, maybe i'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that i could be reminded. i'm feeling a little, you know, i was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and-
56;high;96;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
56;high;97;client;-one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs]
56;high;98;therapist;Mm-hmm.
56;high;99;client;So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? my daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in seattle, she lives-
56;high;100;therapist;Yeah.
56;high;101;client;Far away.
56;high;102;therapist;Yeah.
56;high;103;client;So- and i don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends.
56;high;104;therapist;So you'd like to have a little bit more support-
57;low;0;therapist;Mr. johnson?
57;low;1;client;Yeah?
57;low;2;therapist;Uh, i'm here to talk to you about, uh, your cholesterol and the, um, medicine your doctor prescribed.
57;low;3;client;Uh, i talked with my doctor about my medicine. that's his job.
57;low;4;therapist;But well, it's my job too, uh, to-to help you understand how to use your medicine and, uh, give you information about getting the most benefits from it.
57;low;5;client;Well, to be honest with you, i'm not even certain i'm going to take the medicine. now, i know i got high cholesterol, i've got to get that down, but on the other hand, this medicine can cause some severe muscle weakness and i just can't afford that. i'm a truck driver and i haul those heavy boxes in on the dollies and i just can't afford that, so you know.
57;low;6;therapist;So your-your-your doctor told you that if your cholesterol remains elevated, you're at risk of stroke or heart attack?
57;low;7;client;Yeah, down the line, but-
57;low;8;therapist;Okay. well, the-the side effect is something that's very, very rare, it's not really something you need to worry about, and the risk of stroke or heart attack is much worse.
57;low;9;client;Well, right now it's the muscle weakness that-that i'm concerned about, and that's, uh, you know, that's the present, uh, i've got to do my job.
57;low;10;therapist;Well, i-i-i understand that. um, but like i said, it's very rare. if you feel some muscle weakness, you'll let your doctor know. it's not permanent, okay? yeah, it won't get to the blood- it won't get to the point where it affects your job—
61;high;0;therapist;Hi mrs. smith, my name is terri, i'm one of the nurses who works with dr. fields.
61;high;1;client;Well, i remember you. yeah, we met once before.
61;high;2;therapist;Yes, i think when you were in last time.
61;high;3;client;Yeah.
61;high;4;therapist;And i know that, uh, dr. fields talked with you last time about maybe trying a tai chi class to see how that would go, and i wanted to-to check in with you and see how tai chi went.
61;high;5;client;Well, i went once.
61;high;6;therapist;Uh-huh.
61;high;7;client;Yeah and, um, it was very-very beautiful to see and the instructor was very nice, but i felt kind of self-conscious because i'm still in my walker.
61;high;8;therapist;Uh-huh.
61;high;9;client;And i had to sit in the chair. i couldn't, you know, do what they were doing.
61;high;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.
61;high;11;client;So, it's-- it was-- i simply felt self-conscious.
61;high;12;therapist;Uh-huh. so, you thought it was beautiful and you liked the instructor, but you were a little self-conscious because you were in a chair?
61;high;13;client;A lot self-conscious.
61;high;14;therapist;A lot self-conscious, uh-huh.
61;high;15;client;Yeah.
61;high;16;therapist;What were you hoping to achieve with the, um, by going to tai chi?
61;high;17;client;Well, like dr. fields told me, it helps with balance, and i'm still having the wobblies. so, i was really hoping that i could get to the point where i could benefit from what they had to offer. um, yeah, mostly my balance, mostly my balance.
61;high;18;therapist;Uh-huh. so, you're hoping that it would help with balance, but you didn't see the- maybe the results you were looking for?
61;high;19;client;Not yet.
61;high;20;therapist;Not yet.
61;high;21;client;Yeah.
61;high;22;therapist;Uh-huh. what is your overall goal? what are you working towards?
61;high;23;client;I wanna go home.
61;high;24;therapist;Uh-huh.
61;high;25;client;Yes, i really do.
61;high;26;therapist;Mm-hmm, and what is it that's important to you about getting home?
61;high;27;client;[sighs] everything. i want to be with my little dog.
61;high;28;therapist;Mm-hmm.
61;high;29;client;He's really so cute, and i miss my garden.
61;high;30;therapist;Yeah.
61;high;31;client;And i just miss being independent, going to sleep when i want to sleep and getting up when i want to get up and-and, uh, cooking for myself. the independence. sure i miss being independent.
61;high;32;therapist;Uh-huh. so, you're wanting to get home to your dog, your garden, back to your life, your independence?
61;high;33;client;Yes.
61;high;34;therapist;Mm-hmm.
61;high;35;client;Yeah.
61;high;36;therapist;What do you think you need to do in order to be able to achieve that goal of getting home?
61;high;37;client;Well, they told me that i need to be able to walk down the hallway and back, even with the walker, being secure and not with the wobblies.
61;high;38;therapist;Uh-huh.
61;high;39;client;And i haven't gotten there yet.
61;high;40;therapist;And do you agree that that's what you need to do in order to be able to get home?
61;high;41;client;Yeah.
61;high;42;therapist;Uh-huh.
61;high;43;client;I-i don't want to fall.
61;high;44;therapist;Uh-huh.
61;high;45;client;I-i've had friends that had that happen. so, um, i-i agree a little, with some hesitation, but i do agree.
61;high;46;therapist;Uh-huh, and tell me how your physical therapy is going?
61;high;47;client;Oh, it's better.
61;high;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.
61;high;49;client;It still hurts. it- it's-- i'm getting better. i'm-i'm getting better. it's not quite as painful.
61;high;50;therapist;Mm-hmm.
61;high;51;client;Yeah, so-
61;high;52;therapist;So, it sounds like, um, you can see that you're making some progress in physical therapy-
61;high;53;client;Yes.
61;high;54;therapist;And that you were hoping that the tai chi would help you with the wobblies. uh-huh?
61;high;55;client;Yeah.
61;high;56;therapist;And so, are you wanting to go back to tai chi?
61;high;57;client;[sighs] um, yes-yes i-i do because i-- my friend, i think i told you, really, really loves it and i just, i wish i could go back, and yes i do. i'm not making much sense, but i do.
61;high;58;therapist;Uh-huh. i think it's important, um, that you know that you're the one who has to make the decision about whether or not tai chi works for you.
61;high;59;client;Oh, i don't really know yet after just one time.
61;high;60;therapist;Uh-huh.
61;high;61;client;Yeah. it's-it's-- i can't make that-- it wouldn't be fair for me to say it does or doesn't. it didn't that one time, but you know.
61;high;62;therapist;So, you haven't seen the results that you want yet-
61;high;63;client;Yeah.
61;high;64;therapist;-but because dr. fields has recommended it and your friend has-
61;high;65;client;Yeah.
61;high;66;therapist;-and it sounds like you like the instructor-
61;high;67;client;Yeah, i do.
61;high;68;therapist;-it sounds like you'd like to try and give it another chance?
61;high;69;client;Yeah, i would.
61;high;70;therapist;So, what has to happen in order for you to get to tai chi again?
61;high;71;client;Well, i'd have to make the arrangements again, that was a little complicated, and, um, i'd have to get my head straight about feeling self-conscious, because i-i know that nobody's really looking at me, but i have to convince myself.
61;high;72;therapist;Uh-huh. yeah.
61;high;73;client;Yeah, and the arrangement, arrangements a little complicated.
61;high;74;therapist;Uh-huh. so, how confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10 with one being not at all confident and 10 being very confident that you can make the arrangements in order to get to tai chi.
62;high;0;therapist;#name?
62;high;1;client;I'm good, thanks.
62;high;2;therapist;Good. why don't you fill me in on what's been going on since i saw you last?
62;high;3;client;Um, i guess everything's fine. i think my caseworker mentioned something about community service that i have to do or something. i don't know.
62;high;4;therapist;Okay.
62;high;5;client;I'm not sure of that.
62;high;6;therapist;So she talked to you a little bit about it, but it sounds like you're kind of unsure exactly the details.
62;high;7;client;Yeah, i know that she said i have to get so many hours in, but i don't- i don't know. i kind of was half-listening.
62;high;8;therapist;Okay. so why don't you tell me what you remember from having your conversation with your case manager? what do you know so far about community service?
62;high;9;client;I know that i have to get it done by the end of my probation, except i forgot like how many hours or if i'm supposed to find it or someone else is gonna find it for me or i-i told you i'm confused.
62;high;10;therapist;Okay, gotcha. so, you know, that it needs to get done-
62;high;11;client;Yes.-you know, you have till the end of your probation-
62;high;12;therapist;Yes.
62;high;13;client;-but you're a little fuzzy on the details.
62;high;14;therapist;Exactly, yeah.
62;high;15;client;Okay. um, so maybe if it's okay with you, i can share with you some of, um, the requirements, maybe go over the details a little bit more.
62;high;16;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
62;high;17;client;Is that all right?
62;high;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.
62;high;19;client;Okay, great. um, so with your community service i know you've got 25 hours left to do, um, so that does need to get done by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a really great resource to help you find a place where you can do it. so i know in the past some clients have done their community service at food pantries or shelters, or anywhere in the community that's not, you know, a family member or a friend. um, the urban ecology center is a really great place. you can kind of work outside, work with younger kids. do any of those options seem like a fit that you might be interested in?
62;high;20;therapist;Um, yeah, i just, so i still have to find the community service hours myself?
62;high;21;client;So that's something that you can work with your case manager on.
62;high;22;therapist;Okay.
62;high;23;client;So, um, that's something you can absolutely ask her or quest- or me some questions about, but they'll be able to come and bring you some options-
62;high;24;therapist;Okay.
62;high;25;client;-of places that you can work with, some phone numbers to call.
62;high;26;therapist;Okay.
63;high;0;therapist;So tom, this infection is been pretty painful for you but we have antibiotics. if you take it faithfully for 10 days, i'm sure that your infection will be gone. can you do that?
63;high;1;client;Definitely.
63;high;2;therapist;And do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?
63;high;3;client;Okay.
63;high;4;therapist;Let's take a look. it says that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. which drugs do you use?
63;high;5;client;I do some meth.
63;high;6;therapist;Snort it, smoke it?
63;high;7;client;Snort it, always snort it.
63;high;8;therapist;Don't inject it?
63;high;9;client;Mm-mm.
63;high;10;therapist;Use any other drugs?
63;high;11;client;Just, you know, some alcohol.
63;high;12;therapist;And, uh, um, you do this how often?
63;high;13;client;Meth?
63;high;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.
63;high;15;client;Um, two, three times a month.
63;high;16;therapist;So you're an occasional meth user. you don't use very often?
63;high;17;client;Right.
63;high;18;therapist;Only snort it?
63;high;19;client;Right.
63;high;20;therapist;Well, as i think you know, methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. and the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. and that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because people who use methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. and actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. do you suppose that your std might be associated with your methamphetamine use?
63;high;21;client;Yeah, it could be because, uh, i was high when i had unprotected sex and i would not do that if i were not high.
63;high;22;therapist;So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?
63;high;23;client;Definitely, yeah.
63;high;24;therapist;And it seems to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your judgment?
63;high;25;client;Yeah.
63;high;26;therapist;Anything else happening with methamphetamine in your life? is it affecting you in any way?
63;high;27;client;No, i mean, no. i mean, like i said, i only do it in clubs, you know, with my friends, uh, two or three times a month at-at the most. um, uh, i don't think it's really having other impacts. but i'm-i'm concerned about this one. i never expected to get gonorrhea.
63;high;28;therapist;Yeah, you know, i'm concerned bout it too and i'd actually recommend that you stop using methamphetamine altogether. and, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation.
63;high;29;client;I-i understand but it's i think that would be a hard thing for me to do. you know, i mean, i know i should but, i mean, that's like my whole social life. you know, i mean, all my friends go to these clubs. that's where- that's where i see them. you know, that's my sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. you know, i mean, everyone is doing it there. you know, so it's while i would like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away.
63;high;30;therapist;So you recognize methamphetamine has some problems associated with it and you also on the balance see that a lot of your social life and your sex life involves methamphetamine, it would be difficult to quit using?
63;high;31;client;Yeah, i don't think it would be easy but i'm not saying that i'm not willing to try.
63;high;32;therapist;Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using methamphetamine completely-
63;high;33;client;Mm-hmm.
63;high;34;therapist;-with zero being not ready at all-
63;high;35;client;Mm.
64;high;0;therapist;Well, welcome, ricky.
64;high;1;client;Thank you.
64;high;2;therapist;Nice to meet you.
64;high;3;client;Yeah, you too.
64;high;4;therapist;And you found us okay?
64;high;5;client;Yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah.
64;high;6;therapist;Alright.
64;high;7;client;Yeah. yeah. pretty straightforward-
64;high;8;therapist;Yeah
64;high;9;client;Always good.
64;high;10;therapist;Have you been here before?
64;high;11;client;No. no, not at all.
64;high;12;therapist;Mm. okay. alright. well, um, i know a little about why you're here today-
64;high;13;client;Yeah.
64;high;14;therapist;-um, but it's great to see you, and so maybe a good point to start with is, tell me why you're here.
64;high;15;client;"Sure. um, i guess, you know, maybe two or three weeks ago, i had sort of like this group of friends come around to my place, and um, you know, they-they were sort of saying that it was just like a night to hang out and watch dvds and stuff, and then they sort of sat me down and were like, ""you know, maybe you need to get a bit of help for, you know, drug stuff."" then, you know, i was sort of like, ""well, mm."" and i was quite annoyed by that at first, but i-i suppose, you know, i thought about it for a bit and then i was like, ""well, i guess it can't hurt to talk to someone about it, maybe."""
64;high;16;therapist;Right.
64;high;17;client;Yeah.
64;high;18;therapist;And that's led you to being here today?
64;high;19;client;Yeah.
64;high;20;therapist;Alright.
64;high;21;client;Yeah. i just sort of did a bit of search on the internet and stuff and just read about this place, so i just thought i'll—
64;high;22;therapist;Right. so it sounds like you thought there was something that, uh, that you needed to look at, something that was concerning you?
64;high;23;client;Yeah, i guess. i-i suppose i hadn't really thought about it till they sat me down, and you know- i mean i could, uh, i could understand a little bit of where they were coming from, so yeah, i thought i'd—
64;high;24;therapist;They were concerned for you?
64;high;25;client;Yeah.
64;high;26;therapist;Alright.
64;high;27;client;Yeah. yeah, which kind of was a bit of a sh-shock, i suppose.
64;high;28;therapist;You were surprised?
64;high;29;client;"Yeah. yeah, 'cause, you know, i don't know. you know, you see on movies when people sort of intervene or say, ""you know, you need to go and get help."" and then-- i don't know. like you know those characters and, they-they do need help, you know-"
64;high;30;therapist;Yep.
64;high;31;client;-because they're fucked.
64;high;32;therapist;Mm-hmm.
64;high;33;client;"And you kind of go, ""woah. that's not me."" so it's about am i—"
64;high;34;therapist;You're not sure that applies to you?
64;high;35;client;Yeah, or well, not to that extent, you know what i mean? like, i-i would-- l didn't think i was at anywhere near a point that i would need to be sat down and intervened with-
64;high;36;therapist;Okay.
64;high;37;client;If you know what i mean.
64;high;38;therapist;Alright.
64;high;39;client;I suppose.
64;high;40;therapist;I'm trying to understand you so far, something's concerning you and something's concerning your friends-
64;high;41;client;Yeah.
64;high;42;therapist;-but you're not sure whether it's- whether-- just how bad it is or- and you're just wanting to check that out?
64;high;43;client;Yeah. yeah. yeah, 'cause, i mean, you know, they are my friends and-
64;high;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.
64;high;45;client;- you know, i'm not gonna be so narrow-minded as to say for sure that, you know, they're entirely wrong 'cause there's a big group of them, you know? and they do care, so obviously, there's something there that i might have overlooked. but on the other ha
64;high;46;therapist;Yeah.
64;high;47;client;-and just check it up, yep.
64;high;48;therapist;Because they care about you and-and you respect what they say, and you're wondering whether something about what they're saying may be right, but let's check that out a bit?
64;high;49;client;Yeah, pretty right.
64;high;50;therapist;Alright.
64;high;51;client;Yeah.
64;high;52;therapist;Well, let's do some checking out.
64;high;53;client;Okay, cool.
64;high;54;therapist;So tell me a little bit about what you're doing, what is- what is the concern that they are raising.
64;high;55;client;Um, dr-drugs, i guess.
64;high;56;therapist;Mm-hmm.
64;high;57;client;Mm, yeah. sort of kind of do a bit of p now and again-
64;high;58;therapist;Alright.
64;high;59;client;-and, um, i guess less often, i do a bit of, you know, i smoke a little bit and, um, party pills in the- in the weekend sometimes.
64;high;60;therapist;Okay.
64;high;61;client;Yeah.
64;high;62;therapist;Tell me a little bit about what now and again means, and-and-and how often.
64;high;63;client;Um, a couple of times a week maybe.
64;high;64;therapist;Is this- is this with, uh, with the drug?
64;high;65;client;Yeah, yeah.
64;high;66;therapist;This is meth you're talking about? a couple of times a week?
64;high;67;client;Mm-hmm, yeah. yeah. so i guess when i put it that way, it does sound quite a lot, but it doesn't feel a lot, you know? if you know what i mean?
64;high;68;therapist;Well, maybe, we c-- we can check that out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-- but maybe also importantly to-to discuss with you what the effects are and-and-and what your concerns are about it. but help me to understand a little bit more of what it's like for you. tell me- tell me what are the things about your, uh, use of meth that you- that you've liked that you found good for you?
64;high;69;client;Right. um, i suppose it's kind of hand-in-hand with just hanging out with, sort of, some new scene that i've-- like, um, i moved to auckland maybe three years ago.
64;high;70;therapist;Mm-hmm.
64;high;71;client;And, um, i still live in palmy and, so as you can imagine, it's sort of a bit different down there. and, um, kind of just when i first got here i was sorta introduced a little bit to, um, like do you know family bar on-on [unintelligible 00:06:49]?
64;high;72;therapist;I know family bar, yes.
64;high;73;client;"Yeah. it's that sort of- that sorta scene, that kind of, um, gay scene, i guess. and, like, it's not something i'd really thought about before and-- but then kinda hung out there and just met these people that were sort of like you don't really get there much palmy. well, i mean i suppose you do, but they're not-- you know, in auckland bars like that you can just-- uh, you can just be it out in the open, you know, and i suppose in palmy you can't as easily. um, so just to arrive and see that and kind of meet these people that were just really friendly, you know, and-and not judge me into it. i don't know. you know, palmy often is they're sort of like, ""oh, you've gotta own a car, and soap it up, and drive up and down the main street,"" and i just couldn't give a shit about that, you know, so. or play rugby and, you know, that didn't interest me at all and sorta come here and have people, you know, talk about interesting stuff and have a good time. i just want to go out and dance and stuff like that. um, that was quite cool for me to know that that existed because i hadn't seen that before and-and i suppose there's a lot of that that goes on there, you know?"
64;high;74;therapist;"It's quite a heavy party scene most weekends and stuff. so it kind of goes hand in hand with that really, and just, you know, i guess when i have-have a slight-- i don't know, you just feel really good, i guess. just feel, like, happy, and excited, and just to be surrounded by people that, you know, really care about you, and love you and-- coming from a place where y-you didn't-- don't get that as much, it's just really cool, you know, to-to be able to go, ""okay, on this day i can take this."" and it's just that instant, like, ""i know- i know i'll feel good."" i guess that's part of it."
64;high;75;client;So auckland, coming to auckland from palmerston for you was-was like taking charge of something that you were going to look to make something different in your life?
64;high;76;therapist;Yeah, in-in a way. although i wouldn't have been conscious of that really. i just sort of discovered it here. it's not like i came to auckland looking for that kinda-
64;high;77;client;Right.
64;high;78;therapist;-lift to get away from, um, you know parents mainly, and that kind of lifestyle, that palmy sort of lifestyle. but then yeah, i discovered this other thing, um—
64;high;79;client;Which you weren't aware of in palmerston?
64;high;80;therapist;No.
64;high;81;client;Okay.
64;high;82;therapist;No. i didn't really know. i guess you see sort of things like that in-in movies from america you know, but you don't really-
64;high;83;client;Mm-hmm.
64;high;84;therapist;- think that it would exist in your own country. well, not if you grew up in palmy.
64;high;85;client;Palmerston. mm-hmm.
64;high;86;therapist;Um, i don't mean to be mean about palmy but, you know, it's just the different kinda attitude, i guess, kinda- this done-
64;high;87;client;Yeah.
64;high;88;therapist;To that sort of thing.
64;high;89;client;It sounds like you're ready to move up to something that was different.
64;high;90;therapist;Yes-
64;high;91;client;And-and you came-
64;high;92;therapist;-plus-
64;high;93;client;Here to auckland.
64;high;94;therapist;Yeah, yeah. i definitely wanted to get away from something. i didn't know what too, but then i arrived here and found this thing that was like actually, this was obviously, fate or whatever was pulling me to this thing-
64;high;95;client;Alright.
64;high;96;therapist;-'cause-'cause like i found something in myself or something that was missing.
64;high;97;client;And how does that feel for you now?
64;high;98;therapist;"Um, now, i guess, now, i'm just a little used to it. [clears throat] when i first got here, i was like, ""wow, this is amazing."" this is hard, i guess, but, you know, it's been three years now, so it's just kinda like i've gotten used to it."
64;high;99;client;Mm-hmm.
64;high;100;therapist;"I mean, i guess, i'm, let's say i take it for granted but, um, yes, it's just comfortable now. and, um, it's just a sort of what i do really. yeah, so, i guess that the drugs are linked to that, i suppose. it's j-- well, it's just a part of it, i don't really think-- i didn't really differentiate it. it's just kinda, ""okay, i'm gonna go hang with my friends,"" and that sort of thing, you know, that saturday, friday night thing. and then it just happens really as part of that."
64;high;101;client;So coming out, feeling-- being gay-
64;high;102;therapist;Yep.
64;high;103;client;-being part of a gay culture here in auckland, is feeling good-
64;high;104;therapist;Yeah.
64;high;105;client;For you?
64;high;106;therapist;Yeah.
64;high;107;client;And at the same time, it's-it's linked closely with the- with the drug scene with the meth scene for you?
64;high;108;therapist;Yep.
64;high;109;client;And you're not experiencing where these two things are separate? they just seem to be together more often than not?
64;high;110;therapist;Well, i guess, now, that i think about it, maybe it's sort of gone beyond that, maybe i didn't notice that.
64;high;111;client;So—
64;high;112;therapist;I mean like i always-- well, it's, you know it's kind of a thing that happens in the weekends but, i guess, sometimes in the weekdays. you know, i'll-i'll pretty much every weekend i'll have a big night, um, maybe two but sometimes, you know, in the weekdays like on a tuesday or wednesday or something if i just kinda feel like doing something then i might do that sometimes to see if someone else wants to come round and join me or, you know, occasionally by myself i might have a smoke by myself or something like that. and i guess that isn't entirely linked to that scene, i suppose.
64;high;113;client;It just sounds like something's worrying you about that there's-there's a part link there but there's not a link and that-that maybe that the drugs is-is becoming a more important part in your life.
64;high;114;therapist;Mm. maybe. i suppose i hadn't really thought about it-
64;high;115;client;Okay.
64;high;116;therapist;Until recently.
64;high;117;client;So something's changed recently?
64;high;118;therapist;Yeah. i suppose just since that kind of intervention thing or i started to give them the benefit of the doubt. and it's-
64;high;119;client;Yeah.
64;high;120;therapist;-maybe noticing some things that i hadn't noticed but—
64;high;121;client;Tell me about those things you're noticing that you hadn't noticed before.
64;high;122;therapist;Oh, i mean, e-even just now, you know, when you asked me how often.
64;high;123;client;That surprised you?
64;high;124;therapist;"Mm. s-surprised me to-to think about, you know, when there's stuff, and you don't really think about it, but then if someone asked you, you know, how often or-- and then you kind of have to quantify it, i suppose it kinda sound shocking, you know, if i- if i imagine myself sort of saying, ""i do this, you know, a few times a week."" it-it-"
64;high;125;client;Mm.
64;high;126;therapist;-sounds shocking. but to me it-it's- it doesn't feel that way, you know, that's kind of where that, where it kind of doesn't sit right. i, [clears throat] that's why i kind of got a bit miffed at my friends a little bit, or i dunno, a bit defensive there.
64;high;127;client;Alright.
64;high;128;therapist;Felt a bit weird.
64;high;129;client;Okay.
64;high;130;therapist;Yeah.
64;high;131;client;So you're worried a little bit about it and you're going to find out more about it, but you're-you're not gonna take on this notion of being a headache or anything as yet—
64;high;132;therapist;Yeah.
64;high;133;client;Okay.
64;high;134;therapist;Definitely.
64;high;135;client;So tell me then, um, ricky, what- what's the other side of the good things that-that using meth or doing some smoking does for you? is there a downside to it? are there problems that you're experiencing?
64;high;136;therapist;Yep. um. uh, i suppose money is quite a big thing. like, i used to have a lot more money sorta last year. i had a, quite a good job, like a, quite a regular acting job.
64;high;137;client;Mm-hmm.
64;high;138;therapist;Um, and it was like quite a lot of money that la-last year. so it wasn't such a problem then. and i suppose i sort of blew that money a little bit. um, so now i don't have that acting income coming in as frequently and i'm working in a cafe like a sort of part-time and it's not bringing in as much. so now it's kinda like, and sometimes i need to borrow a bit of money or sorta need a bit of help with the rent sometimes.
64;high;139;client;Quite a lot's changed over the last year from—
64;high;140;therapist;Yeah. yeah. a little bit.
64;high;141;client;It doesn't sound like it was part of the plan.
64;high;142;therapist;No. but you know, that's the life of an actor, i suppose, ups and downs works and not works.
64;high;143;client;Sure. [chuckling] it's not a secure profession-
64;high;144;therapist;No.
64;high;145;client;-and it's-it's hard-
64;high;146;therapist;It's not.
64;high;147;client;-it's hard. but is-is there, i just wonder, is there a connection at all between the-the-the-the acting and the meth use in terms of the effect of the meth use on your- on your ability to get work?
64;high;148;therapist;Hmm. could have been a couple of auditions that i didn't do so well and as i could have 'cause of that.
64;high;149;client;The drug may have had an effect on that?
64;high;150;therapist;"Uh, maybe. maybe it's just my general sort of state. um,i dunno, sometimes i suppose just kind of weighs on my mind a little bit like, ""what am i doing or why am i spending my money on this?"" i mean, when it's happening, it's like, this is amazing."
64;high;151;client;Hmm. hmm.
64;high;152;therapist;You know am i-- you go in- you go into places, interesting places, but you know, i could just as well have saved that money and actually gone to interesting places i suppose. but i don't know. i wonder if it- if-if it's having an effect. i-i don't know. i can't say for sure, but maybe it's not so good for the face, i dunno. [crosstalk] dunno if i look tired or-or run down or-
64;high;153;client;Alright.
64;high;154;therapist;-or if i actually am tired or run down, i suppose. again, this is things that i haven't really thought about-
64;high;155;client;Alright.
64;high;156;therapist;-but now i'm starting to think about.
65;high;0;therapist;Many people have told me, um, if i quit smoking, i'm going to gain weight.
65;high;1;client;Mm.
65;high;2;therapist;Well, food really doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better-
65;high;3;client;Mm-hmm.
65;high;4;therapist;If you quit smoking.
65;high;5;client;Mm-hmm.
65;high;6;therapist;Now the downside to that is i'm gonna gain weight.
65;high;7;client;Mm-hmm.
65;high;8;therapist;That means a new wardrobe, which i'd like to have, but i can't afford it.
65;high;9;client;Okay. so right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. it's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years.
65;high;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.
65;high;11;client;It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought i'll never smoke then.
65;high;12;therapist;Right.
65;high;13;client;Yeah. and your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. so i'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping.
65;high;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.
65;high;15;client;I'm wondering what else might be on that list.
65;high;16;therapist;Um, withdrawal.
65;high;17;client;Mm.
65;high;18;therapist;They say it's awful. um, being cranky.
65;high;19;client;Mm-hmm.
65;high;20;therapist;And if i do go through this, i just hope my friends understand and will support me in what i'm trying to do.
66;high;0;therapist;Hi, mr. stowe.
66;high;1;client;Hey.
66;high;2;therapist;How are you doing today? i'm bruce berger.
66;high;3;client;Pleasure to meet you.
66;high;4;therapist;I, uh, i'm a case manager with your health plan. i understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes.
66;high;5;client;Yeah. i'm supposed to learn how to manage it. i just learned that i got diabetes and apparently, it's pretty bad 'cause, uh, she said my blood sugar was sky high, and then she laid all these huge consequences on things that can happen. that just sounds so disastrous and, uh, and then she told me i gotta do all this stuff. and man, i'm just sort of disappointed right now.
66;high;6;therapist;So you just- you just saw the doctor and, uh, you know, you sound like you just got blindsided, uh, with, uh, not only how, how frightening this seems that you have diabetes and that, uh, she-- you say she told you a whole lot of things that can happen with your eyes and circulation and all those kinds of things.
66;high;7;client;She mentioned my legs having troubles and-
66;high;8;therapist;And so you're really kind of reeling right now from, uh, all of that. and you sound a little bit pretty, pretty scared actually.
66;high;9;client;Well, that's, yeah. it's not just being scared, you know. i don't want that to happen to me, but then when i, when-when she reels off all these things i gotta do and i'm sort of going oh, oh, you know, i'm not certain i can even get it done. so it's sort of sitting-- well, you know, i'm sitting here thinking that, oh my god, this is- this is what's gonna happen to me.
66;high;10;therapist;So it sounds like-
66;high;11;client;And it is discouraging, just like discouraging.
66;high;12;therapist;So it sounds a lot like, uh, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control. can't imagine doing all those things, so you almost feel like all that bad stuff's gonna happen.
66;high;13;client;Yeah. it looks like a massive task that i'm may not be able to handle. and then, yeah, all this horrible stuff happens to me. i mean, it's- it's a bleak-looking situation and a lot worse.
66;high;14;therapist;Okay. and i-- and what i want to do is help you kind of break this up into some-some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down. i, you know, on the one hand, your doctor is right, you know. your blood sugar is very high and we do wanna get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen. uh, and-and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to-to get your blood sugar down. um, you know, on the other hand, we can take this a step at a time, so it's not so overwhelming.
66;high;15;client;And i'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now. you know, for example, there- there's basically three things that need to be worked out with diabetes. taking your medicine as prescribed. and honestly, if i was gonna work on one thing right away, given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that-that first, because that'll have the biggest impact. how-how does that sound so far?
66;high;16;therapist;Well, i don't think too much trouble in taking the medicines, especially since i understand my blood sugar is really high. and-
66;high;17;client;So that's easy to do.
67;high;0;therapist;Is it okay if we go over the form you had filled out? we give this out to everybody who comes in.
67;high;1;client;Mm-hmm.
67;high;2;therapist;All right. so here, it looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last year, and you have used marijuana more often, 30 days in last year.
67;high;3;client;Something like that.
67;high;4;therapist;Okay. when students and i talk about their substance use, the first thing i always say, i don't like to tell anyone what to do. that's not my job. instead, i like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. so what can you tell me about your marijuana use?
67;high;5;client;Uh, i vape. i have a pen, but i don't smoke it though.
67;high;6;therapist;Okay. how often?
67;high;7;client;Um, a few times a month.
67;high;8;therapist;Do you vape anything else besides marijuana?
67;high;9;client;I did a peppermint oil once, someone shared it with me.
67;high;10;therapist;Okay. is it okay if i share some information with you?
67;high;11;client;Mm-hmm.
67;high;12;therapist;We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. for example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. about one in six people who begin using marijuana as a teenager, later on, become addicted. so what do you think about all this information that i've shared?
67;high;13;client;Well, i don't think it's going to hurt me.
67;high;14;therapist;How do you think it affects you?
67;high;15;client;Um, i don't know. it makes me relax, and it's fun to laugh with my friend.
67;high;16;therapist;Is there anything about marijuana that worries you, many things that you don't like?
67;high;17;client;Well, i don't want to get in trouble like at school.
67;high;18;therapist;How could you get in trouble at school?
67;high;19;client;Well, i can get suspended and i would get kicked off the team, the basketball team.
67;high;20;therapist;So staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you?
67;high;21;client;Right.
67;high;22;therapist;So when you think about these things, are there any things you would like to change about your marijuana use?
67;high;23;client;Well, i was thinking to not use when basketball season start.
67;high;24;therapist;What would be the benefits of that?
67;high;25;client;Well, i play better when i'm not high.
67;high;26;therapist;Marijuana affects how well you play. what would be the other benefits for you?
67;high;27;client;Well, i wouldn't get caught with using a pen, so i wouldn't get kicked off the basketball team.
68;high;0;therapist;Hi, andrea, thanks for coming in.
68;high;1;client;Hi. thank you.
68;high;2;therapist;So i don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here. so i thought i'd start by telling you a little bit about myself.
68;high;3;client;Okay.
68;high;4;therapist;Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students. i meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any changes you might wanna make for your life if you decide that you do. it's not my job to change you. i couldn't even if i wanted to. that's not my role at all. it's really to help you think about, you know, how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward.
68;high;5;client;Okay.
68;high;6;therapist;Does that sound okay?
68;high;7;client;Yeah.
68;high;8;therapist;All right. so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself?
68;high;9;client;Sure. um, as you know, i'm andrea, i, uh, i'm a junior i'm in the marching band. i play the tenor sax.
68;high;10;therapist;Oh, neat.
68;high;11;client;Yeah, i'm also in the-- i'm a bit of a band geek. [laughter] i play, you know, in the wind ensemble and the jazz band, things like that.
68;high;12;therapist;Wow. you really are involved in music.
68;high;13;client;Yeah, [crosstalk].
68;high;14;therapist;When did you start?
68;high;15;client;Oh, i started playing about 10 years ago, actually.
68;high;16;therapist;Wow.
68;high;17;client;Yeah, i started on the violin first, and then i went on, explored a little with the piano, clarinet, finally found the tenor sax, and yeah.
68;high;18;therapist;Very cool. i've always wanted to be good at music. [laughter] all right. so it sounds like you're in band and a-a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun?
68;high;19;client;Um, you know, just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach, things like that.
68;high;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;21;client;Yeah.
68;high;22;therapist;Just kind of everyday sort of stuff?
68;high;23;client;Yeah [laughs].
68;high;24;therapist;Okay. tell me a little bit about your family.
68;high;25;client;Uh, well i have one older brother he's about eight and a half old- years older than me. my parents, and i have a dog [laughs].
68;high;26;therapist;Cute. what kind of dog?
68;high;27;client;He's a golden retriever.
68;high;28;therapist;Oh, nice. okay.
68;high;29;client;My big boy.
68;high;30;therapist;[laughs] very fun. all right. and how are things going in school for you?
68;high;31;client;They're pretty good. grades have been pretty all right. still like 3.7 ish.
68;high;32;therapist;Okay, great, so you're doing well. what sorts of goals do you have for after college- oh, after high school?
68;high;33;client;Uh, i'd like to, you know, i'd like to, of course, graduate high school, hopefully, go to a nice ivy league school.
68;high;34;therapist;Oh, all right.
68;high;35;client;But i mean, that might not happen. and then i'd like to go on and become a doctor. study psychology and then become a psychiatrist or something.
68;high;36;therapist;Okay, you have some pretty big dreams.
68;high;37;client;Yeah.
68;high;38;therapist;That's great. that's really exciting to think about that-
68;high;39;client;Yeah.
68;high;40;therapist;-and sort of be looking forward to the future and those things. all right. well, one thing i'm going to ask you about is, um, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life. whether it's, you know, their cult
68;high;41;client;Mm-hmm.
68;high;42;therapist;Like belonging or sense of community. again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. so, when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?
68;high;43;client;Um, i think a sense of community and belonging.
68;high;44;therapist;Okay.
68;high;45;client;I think those two and, um, respect.
68;high;46;therapist;Respect, okay. can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three?
68;high;47;client;Yeah. well, i think community and belonging, i kind of related them. um, you know how i said i was in the marching band?
68;high;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;49;client;I really, you know, i really enjoy being in that team setting of, you know, being with other people and all working toward- together towards that one goal.
68;high;50;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;51;client;And then in terms of respect, i-i kind of view that as one of like my major like rules. like, i-i really do think respect is important, to respect myself and respect those around me, so.
68;high;52;therapist;Okay.
68;high;53;client;I place great importance in that.
68;high;54;therapist;Okay, great. so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of, um, uh, belonging, like you said.
68;high;55;client;Mm-hmm.
68;high;56;therapist;And sort of a-a sense of purpose in a way.
68;high;57;client;Yes, purpose.
68;high;58;therapist;And then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing.
68;high;59;client;Yes.
68;high;60;therapist;Not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. okay, that's great.
68;high;61;client;Definitely, that's right.
68;high;62;therapist;All right. well, um, one of the things i wanted to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends. so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?
68;high;63;client;Um, sometimes we just, you know, go to the movies, go to the beach, like i had said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's house, play some good board games and hang out.
68;high;64;therapist;Mm-hmm, and when you're hanging out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved?
68;high;65;client;Yeah, sometimes.
68;high;66;therapist;Okay. can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?
68;high;67;client;Uh, well it's mostly just for, for parties or party settings is kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up as they say.
68;high;68;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. and so when you go to parties, most of the time there's alcohol there?
68;high;69;client;Yeah.
68;high;70;therapist;Okay. and how often do you think you would say you're drinking?
68;high;71;client;I'd say, um, on a not busy month, for instance, i'd say about like two weekends out of the month. two or three.
68;high;72;therapist;Mm-hmm. so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?
68;high;73;client;The days that we drink are mostly, like i said, they're parties, so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun. and then when we don't, it's a lot more relaxed. it's a lot more hanging out, playing board games, watching a movie it's not yeah.
68;high;74;therapist;So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is gonna be there?
68;high;75;client;Definitely.
68;high;76;therapist;Okay. and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus a night you're playing board games?
68;high;77;client;Um, i think of them as-as different, i think, you know, like in playing board games and things, it's meant to be relaxing.
68;high;78;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;79;client;So it's nice to have like that kind of breather-
68;high;80;therapist;Uh-huh.
68;high;81;client;-versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's, uh, after it all, it's very draining.
68;high;82;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;83;client;But in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have fun.
68;high;84;therapist;Okay. so there's sort of pros and cons on both sides?
68;high;85;client;Yeah.
68;high;86;therapist;Okay. what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?
68;high;87;client;Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we-we tend to have more fun because i guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together. we're a lot more loosened up and relaxed-
68;high;88;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;89;client;-and not really thinking about stresses or things like that, but it can be--when it's too much drinking, it can be- can be obviously bad.
68;high;90;therapist;Okay. so sort of in the-the too much drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol?
68;high;91;client;Um, a lot of times, it'll make- it'll make people stupid. [laughs] yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that. we-we usually try to be as safe about it
68;high;92;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;93;client;-as possible. so we'll like sleep over at a friend's house. and so that, you know, we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group. so we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks.
68;high;94;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;95;client;But, um, definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stup- when they're drunk and can be really stupid.
68;high;96;therapist;Mm-hmm. so you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities?
68;high;97;client;Yeah
68;high;98;therapist;You're trying to stay put, you're not driving. you're trying to stay with people that you trust. um, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some things happening from time to time.
68;high;99;client;Sometimes. yeah.
68;high;100;therapist;Can you tell me a little bit about that?
68;high;101;client;Well, i, especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends, like we drink too much and we end up like throwing up or things like that, that i don't- that's not fun.
68;high;102;therapist;Yeah. throwing up is never fun.
68;high;103;client;It's not.
68;high;104;therapist;And how often do you think that happens?
68;high;105;client;For me, that's happened to me once. it was the first time i ever drunk and it was- it was a lot, i didn't know what i was doing. i was mixing all kinds of weird things and just kind of taking anything everyone- anyone gave me
68;high;106;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;107;client;-and that didn't end well.
68;high;108;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;109;client;But after that, i haven't- but i do have friends that still do sometimes, so i'll end up like having to take care of them or something and-
68;high;110;therapist;Okay.
68;high;111;client;It kind of puts a downer on my- on my fun.
68;high;112;therapist;Uh-huh. okay. so, on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sorta, um, carefree can kind of let loose a little bit more, on-on the other hand, there's a little bit more, i guess, planning involved-
68;high;113;client;Yeah.
68;high;114;therapist;-because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. and then, um, there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck de
68;high;115;client;Yeah. people can get a little like sloppy, i guess. like they're all loose, like with people in corners doing things that should be done in private-
68;high;116;therapist;Mm-hmm.
68;high;117;client;And that kind of stuff.
68;high;118;therapist;So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see.
68;high;119;client;Yeah.
68;high;120;therapist;Got it. okay. um, all right. well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. why did you make those decisions?
68;high;121;client;I just- i've, you know, i have an aunt who is an alcoholic. so i-i see like the issues that are involved and i've seen movies and things i know that drunk driving is an issue-
69;low;0;therapist;Hi, dr. martin. i heard you had a question for me. what did you want to talk about?
69;low;1;client;I'm sorry, but are you the pharmacist? i just had a question about citalopram.
69;low;2;therapist;Yeah, i'm the pharmacist on duty. citalopram, okay. it's an antidepressant and it comes in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. it's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about 35 hours. for side effects, there are sexual side effects, heart side effects, and stomach side effects.
69;low;3;client;Okay, but i just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine?
70;high;0;therapist;Hi, dr. martin. i'm lori. i'm the pharmacist on duty here today. i understand that you have some questions about the medication citalopram. do you have a minute to talk about that?
70;high;1;client;Yeah, i do, just a couple of minutes though.
70;high;2;therapist;All right. well, do you have any specific questions?
70;high;3;client;Um, nothing specific. i just am unfamiliar with the medication.
70;high;4;therapist;Okay. well, citalopram is an ssri medication. its indication is for depression and it's typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet but it is available as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. any patients started on this medication should be monitored for improvement in symptoms in four to eight weeks.
70;high;5;client;Okay. uh, what about side effects?
70;high;6;therapist;If there are some side effects to this, it can include gi effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. but if you have a patient that suffers from any of those things, you can try either decreasing the dose or changing them to a different agent. do you have any other questions?
71;high;0;therapist;So, you've got this dream by the sounds of it, which is, you know, to have a partner, and a house, and a nice car-
71;high;1;client;Yeah.
71;high;2;therapist;-so don't forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a- be a good dad-
71;high;3;client;Yeah, yeah.
71;high;4;therapist;-to your kids. so, is this dream starting to-- i am getting a picture of?
71;high;5;client;Yeah, it'd be good.
71;high;6;therapist;Yeah. okay. so, what i'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.
71;high;7;client;I guess it doesn't.
71;high;8;therapist;Yeah, how doesn't it fit, billy?
71;high;9;client;Uh, i guess i have to keep coming-coming back here and go into court and stuff.
71;high;10;therapist;Yeah?
71;high;11;client;Yeah. it kinda messes things up.
71;high;12;therapist;Yeah. it kinda messes up that dream, that picture?
71;high;13;client;Yeah. it makes it harder.
71;high;14;therapist;Mm. makes it harder? yeah. well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?
71;high;15;client;Mm.
71;high;16;therapist;And harder to—
71;high;17;client;Like it's hard to get a job 'cause you have to say that you've done prison time and stuff, so it's pretty hard.
71;high;18;therapist;Yeah.
71;high;19;client;Yeah.
71;high;20;therapist;And we've talked about that idea of you getting a job and something to do with cars 'cause that's where your passion is.
71;high;21;client;Mm.
71;high;22;therapist;Yeah? so, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?
71;high;23;client;Uh, i don't know if-if i would go into polytech, done courses there or something.
71;high;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.
71;high;25;client;Yeah. like, if they've got jobs now.
71;high;26;therapist;Okay, so you know some people?
71;high;27;client;Yeah.
71;high;28;therapist;You've gone down that road of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-
71;high;29;client;Yeah, yeah.
71;high;30;therapist;Getting a qualification?
71;high;31;client;Yeah.
71;high;32;therapist;Yeah? so, what-what would interest you about going down that same, sort of, path?
71;high;33;client;Just learn more about cars and just, kind of, hands-on job.
71;high;34;therapist;Mm-hmm. yeah, so what in particular? like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?
71;high;35;client;[sighs] mechanic, or panel [unintelligible 00:18:02], or just-- i wouldn't care, i just-- as long as it's cars.
71;high;36;therapist;Mm-hmm. so, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?
71;high;37;client;Yes, pretty much.
71;high;38;therapist;Yeah?
71;high;39;client;Yeah.
71;high;40;therapist;Okay. so-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?
71;high;41;client;Just i have to get that training, i guess, and then probably get a job.
71;high;42;therapist;Mm-hmm.
71;high;43;client;Yeah.
71;high;44;therapist;Okay. so, what sort of training did you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?
71;high;45;client;Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. i don't know what exactly it was, but—
71;high;46;therapist;Mm-hmm.
71;high;47;client;It took them like-- and, it took them like a year or something, and then they went into apprenticeship.
71;high;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.
71;high;49;client;Yeah.
71;high;50;therapist;Yeah. so, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these friends that you've got?
71;high;51;client;Yeah. i could do it pretty easy. it's just, like, i probably know all this stuff already.
71;high;52;therapist;Okay. so, it would be pretty easy. so, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, billy?
71;high;53;client;Like, well, i went out and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, like, having to apply, so i-i just couldn't-- i don't know. i couldn't do it.
71;high;54;therapist;Okay. so, you actually went to the polytech—
71;high;55;client;Yeah, yeah.
71;high;56;therapist;And picked up some forms?
71;high;57;client;Yeah, yeah. passed around and everything.
71;high;58;therapist;Wow.
71;high;59;client;Yeah.
71;high;60;therapist;That's fantastic, billy.
71;high;61;client;Yeah, but i just-- like, they wouldn't help me out, so-
71;high;62;therapist;Okay.
71;high;63;client;-i got some forms and-
71;high;64;therapist;Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they-- like it didn't help you? what-what-what happened?
71;high;65;client;I asked- i asked them what i had to do, and they said i had to fill out some forms, but-
71;high;66;therapist;Yeah.
71;high;67;client;-well, the forms, it's too confusing.
71;high;68;therapist;Okay. so, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?
71;high;69;client;Yeah, yeah. well, i got one- i got one for panel [unintelligible 00:19:33], and one for, uh, uh, like, panel and paint-
71;high;70;therapist;Mm.
71;high;71;client;-so, learning how to paint cars and stuff.
71;high;72;therapist;Yeah.
71;high;73;client;Yeah.
71;high;74;therapist;Okay. so, you got the forms, took them- took them home?
71;high;75;client;Yeah. i was gonna fill them out there, but then i didn't get them, so i took them home, but i was gonna get donna to help me, but i just didn't get around to it.
71;high;76;therapist;Mm-hmm. you said the forms were confusing?
71;high;77;client;Yeah.
71;high;78;therapist;Yeah? what-what's the confusing bit?
71;high;79;client;I didn't understand, like, what you're supposed to write down. like, yeah. i'm not good at this, maybe too confusing.
71;high;80;therapist;Yeah. so, when you've had to write things or fill out forms before, how-how's that been for you?
71;high;81;client;I don't really deal with it. i s-- i don't really like writing.
71;high;82;therapist;You don't like writing?
71;high;83;client;No.
71;high;84;therapist;Yeah. so, wondering what that's about, about not actually liking writing.
71;high;85;client;No, i'm just real messy, so people can't read it.
71;high;86;therapist;People can't read-- people can't read your handwriting?
71;high;87;client;[chuckles] yeah, no. it's what they say, yeah.
71;high;88;therapist;Oh, you must be a doctor.
71;high;89;client;Yeah, i am. [chuckles]
71;high;90;therapist;Yeah? [chuckles] yeah?
71;high;91;client;Yeah.
71;high;92;therapist;Okay. so, you need some help to fill out the forms?
71;high;93;client;Yeah. like, a computer or something. if you could write on a computer, i could do that.
71;high;94;therapist;Mm.
71;high;95;client;But, we don't have a computer.
71;high;96;therapist;Okay. all right, so what-what do you need to do, billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it off?
71;high;97;client;Just ask to get someone else to do it i guess. i guess i could ask donna, but it's been embarrassing.
71;high;98;therapist;Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask donna to give you some help-
71;high;99;client;Yeah.
71;high;100;therapist;-because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?
72;low;0;therapist;All right, chris, so i need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school. and as-as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student-athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule. and i've been hearing some chatter from some of the other kids about a party this weekend, and from what i hear, where you were there and, you know, i can't confirm or deny anything. so i'm not at the point where i can give you consequences, but i did want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.
72;low;1;client;Right. actually, i do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. usually, as, you know, i'm, um, i'm an honor student. i-i usually i'm studying over the weekend and my parents don't let me go out to parties, but i kind of use that to my advantage, to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. and when i- when i got there, like i'm not used to this like party environment where everything you see in the movies is kind of what happens, where you have people just drinking out of the bottle-
72;low;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.
72;low;3;client;-or playing random games with alcohol, just to get drunk for no reason. and because i was there in the moment, i felt pressured to do and like conform to what everyone else was doing. so i wouldn't be- i wouldn't be ostracized.
72;low;4;therapist;Yeah, you know, i get it. like, we've all been there. okay. you know, i was in high school ones too, you know, i drank too. i get it. there's not a ton to do in this town a-and kids drink, but, you know, promise we have these rules-
72;low;5;client;I understand.
72;low;6;therapist;-and you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules.
72;low;7;client;Okay. um, i know that it's bad for me. it's-it's bad for my body. it's bad for-for-for-for being on the team, for being an athlete. it hinders my performance. just, i don't know. i-i feel that my-my friends pressure me. i don't know. i feel i should like go with different friend groups. maybe. i don't know.
72;low;8;therapist;Yeah. chris, come on. you're getting peer pressure?
72;low;9;client;I don't know, like being in a sports team, y-you feel very, you have to like be unified with the group.
72;low;10;therapist;Yeah, but you're one of the leaders.
72;low;11;client;Right. and as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be-- i expect them to lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. and if that's a social- that's a social custom in our society. so it's like—
72;low;12;therapist;Yeah. well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker then.
72;low;13;client;I could, but that could also backfire on me. i feel that i could be ridiculed for being, having a stick up my butt, you know.
72;low;14;therapist;You're a star player, who's going to pick on you?
72;low;15;client;I mean, it's just one-- i'm just one person against the voice of the mob.
72;low;16;therapist;All right. well, yeah. so the issue again is i can't be hearing reports about you drinking. i can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on facebook. you know, there-there are rules at this school and in my job, i have to enforce them. so, you know, like i said, i get it, you know-
72;low;17;client;I understand.
73;high;0;therapist;He, um, introduced me to it too, so i've tried it.
73;high;1;client;So with his encouragement, you-you tried some drugs.
73;high;2;therapist;Oxy.
73;high;3;client;You tried oxy? okay.
73;high;4;therapist;Yeah.
73;high;5;client;Okay. and he encouraged you to do that.
73;high;6;therapist;Well, yeah he said it was a pain- a pain medicine.
73;high;7;client;He said that it would help you with some of the pain that you've been having.
73;high;8;therapist;Mm-hmm.
73;high;9;client;Yeah.
73;high;10;therapist;And it has, but i don't do it as often, it's just sometimes.
73;high;11;client;Okay. so you trusted him on that, and you tried it out and you found that it helped you in certain ways. what are some of the things that you said it's-- takes some of the pain away, it's not just-- you know.
73;high;12;therapist;Dealing with my grandma's loss.
73;high;13;client;Okay, so that's helped you.
73;high;14;therapist;Yeah. i feel alone, and i just, i miss her and, it does- it does help but,-
76;high;0;therapist;Hi.
76;high;1;client;Hi, deborah. how are you doing today?
76;high;2;therapist;Good, i'm doing really good.
76;high;3;client;Yes, um, so you did do your values clarification sheet. is there anything that you'd like to talk about that you discovered?
76;high;4;therapist;Yeah, i really like doing this, and, um, i-i rated health as my first-
76;high;5;client;Oh, so it's your first?
76;high;6;therapist;-uh, value. yeah, because i really value physical and mental health, um, spiritual, emotional. everything as a whole package, i guess, health. um, and i'm working on, um, a certification to become a fitness trainer. cal state [inaudible 00:00:40] there's
76;high;7;client;Mm-hmm.
76;high;8;therapist;Um, but it's kind of exciting, a different career path in my life. being an office worker for so long is getting boring too-- physical activity, health, in that respect.
76;high;9;client;So, health being your number one, um, which is kind of pushing you into this new direction, as far as you being a prior officer worker? you're doing something that you're actually living to do.
76;high;10;therapist;Yeah, i like being active. you know, if i could, um, be more adept to tennis, and i would love to do something like that coaching people how to play tennis, but i don't. i know enough about the game and play it, but i-i don't think my skill level would be high enough to actually coach other people but—
76;high;11;client;Now, have you done this sheet more than once?
76;high;12;therapist;Yes, i have.
76;high;13;client;And then, has health always been number one for you?
76;high;14;therapist;It's been in the top. it's been up there, yeah. i don't remember if it's always been number one. it's probably definitely been in the top three. uh, yeah, because i've had problems, um, with inner harmony, i guess in different stages in my life, so i don't get that. this time i put it at number two.
76;high;15;client;Inner harmony is number two?
76;high;16;therapist;Yeah, it's just funny how it came out that it wasn't in the top 12. but then when i look at it again it had something to do with, um, peace, uh, inner peace or something or something in there.
76;high;17;client;Mm-hmm.
76;high;18;therapist;And, um, i put that as a higher priority, or top of my value list.
76;high;19;client;So, would you like to express more on the inner harmony part of how that affects your life?
76;high;20;therapist;Yeah. um, since i've been practicing yoga, and since i learned how to teach yoga, that's been something that i've been, um, coming to terms with more, that i feel like i have a lot more inner harmony. i'm more at peace with myself, and in-in the quiet times, and if i'm meditating.
76;high;21;client;Mm-hmm.
76;high;22;therapist;Um, i really feel like-- yeah, i feel like really good about myself.
76;high;23;client;So, yoga, is that based on the number two, like inner harmony? that's where that comes from?
76;high;24;therapist;"Yeah, that's part of it. yeah, and then just feeling like, um, i don't have to please other people either. it's not a selfish thing to put myself first. and, uh, that's something i've always tried to do, make other people happy, please other people, and-and also put myself second, third, fourth, or whatever it is. and i always thought, ""well, that's the way a good person should be.they should always put other people first, you know. and then there's times for that, you know. there's something going on, and you wanna go out of your way to help people, and you say, ""well, my needs aren't so important right now."" i think that is okay to do once in a while. as long as you know- you know that you're not really, um, doing anything detrimental to yourself while you're doing it. and you realize, ""well, i'm just-- i'm really helping this other person a lot, and it gives me satisfaction."""
76;high;25;client;Mm-hmm.
76;high;26;therapist;"Not out of a sense of, uh, you know, ""i'm obligated to this person."""
76;high;27;client;Yes, yes, yes. so, basically, reflecting on how you felt before about you were coming second, third, and fourth. um, it was- it was really a problem, you know, like, how could you be so, you know, selfish, and think about yourself when-
76;high;28;therapist;Mm-hmm.
76;high;29;client;-the reality is inner peace and inner harmony is based around, you know, self-self worth, and you know, self-- and-and dealing with-
76;high;30;therapist;Self love.
76;high;31;client;Self love.
76;high;32;therapist;Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah. [crosstalk] and that it's not selfish.
76;high;33;client;Yeah that's not selfish. and so you feel as though you can help, you can be of help to others, um, just as long as it's not detrimental to yourself. it's true.
76;high;34;therapist;Yes. yeah. um, then, and but also service, that's third because i really do enjoy helping other people. being there for other people, you know, and-and if it puts myself out. like i have my brother, his-his daughter, and his granddaughter they come over and, uh, i slept on-on the air mattress and, uh, me with my mother and my dad and my sis-- my-- his daughter in the other spare room that i have.
76;high;35;client;Mm-hmm.
76;high;36;therapist;And i do that, but i think, well, it's one night or it's two nights that i have a guest. i could sleep in my bed all the other days. [unintelligible 00:05:54]
76;high;37;client;So, you know, even if it's a little inconvenient for me, or my house gets messy, or my kitchen is a mess, or whatever they don't pick up after themselves it's okay. you know, i'll live. you know, it's okay, it's not a big deal. yeah. before it was wisdom, because i really, that's, um-- it is high on my list and it might be higher if these other things weren't here.
76;high;38;therapist;But i like i enjoy learning and experiencing different cultures going, um, to different places in the world and then just also being around people that live in the community that are from other cultures. and i think that brings a lot of wisdom. and just also being open to, uh, differences. and then like today, election day realizing that something might happen, uh, in the congress or the senate, that's gonna be sort of against my values but if it happens, it happens, and i have to deal with it and-and be at peace with myself with about whatever anybody else is doing i still have to have that inner peace within myself.
76;high;39;client;And in the sense of you saying in your words, you'll live.
78;high;0;therapist;Hi. are you julie thompson?
78;high;1;client;Mm-hmm. yeah.
78;high;2;therapist;Hi, i'm bruce berger. i work in the clinic and, uh, i noticed that you're in to pick up a prescription for sarah's, uh, rescue inhaler-
78;high;3;client;Mm-hmm.
78;high;4;therapist;-for her asthma. i noticed that she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. what's that- what's that been like for you?
78;high;5;client;It's been- it's been really difficult. um, i hate to see her gasping for breath. and, um, i'm really worried, you know, when she has to go. uh, so that's been-- it's really difficult when i have to take her.
78;high;6;therapist;Yeah, it sounds like you'd be willing to do whatever you can to try to prevent that from happening.
78;high;7;client;Mm-hmm. yeah.
78;high;8;therapist;Okay. i-i also noticed that, uh, it's been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler.
78;high;9;client;Mm-hmm.
78;high;10;therapist;Are you having some difficulties with that?
78;high;11;client;Well, i did research on the chronic inhaler and i found out that there were steroids in it and that-that i don't want her taking steroids. i did, uh, research on some of the potential side effects and some of the health problems that can result from taking steroids and i-i just don't want her to take those at all. i don't want her exposed to them at all. and then, uh, let me just go ahead and lay this out right now. uh, because i'm sure it'll come up, but i-i do smoke. but i make sure that i do not smoke around her so that i make sure that it does not affect her. so-
78;high;12;therapist;Okay.
78;high;13;client;I just want to let you know that right off.
78;high;14;therapist;Well, it sounds like you care about sarah a great deal. you-you don't want her, uh, using steroids. you're worried about what kind of effects those would have on her and you're- you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma.
78;high;15;client;Mm-hmm. yeah.
78;high;16;therapist;Okay. uh, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with, you know, the steroids because, you know, i certainly don't want her using a medicine that has steroids in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. uh, can we talk about that just a little bit?
78;high;17;client;Yeah.
78;high;18;therapist;Okay. even though, uh, even though this medicine isn't the-the medicine that's in this is in the same broad family as the steroids you're worried about, and those are called anabolic steroids.
78;high;19;client;Okay.
78;high;20;therapist;Which build people up and have masculinizing effects.
78;high;21;client;Mm-hmm.
78;high;22;therapist;If-if i can draw an analogy-- again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. if i could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. and if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. if you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. if we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. and what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. and-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. it only goes to her lungs. and as i said, i wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. this is really safe for your daughter to use. so what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?
78;high;23;client;Well, i-i guess i didn't realize that they weren't the same thing as the anabolic steroids.
78;high;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.
78;high;25;client;Which are the ones that cause all the problems and everything. so, um, if-if you can assure me that it's not going to have those same side effects and health problems-
78;high;26;therapist;"Yeah, def-definitely would not. i mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh."""
78;high;27;client;Yeah.
78;high;28;therapist;You know. and so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. but i do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about.
78;high;29;client;Okay.
78;high;30;therapist;Do you mind if i talk to you a little bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency room?
78;high;31;client;Yeah.
78;high;32;therapist;Okay. when-when somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. if i could use an analogy, again, if-if you had the skin burnt off your arm, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned off your arm, it wouldn't bother you at all. but when the skin's burned off your arm, you literally react to it. her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. uh, and like the skin on your arm would be if the skin got burned off. and what this drug can do? this chronic inhaler is reduce the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain exquisitely sensitive. because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, in ways that it would not normally affect us.
78;high;33;client;Oh, okay.
78;high;34;therapist;And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. okay? which is why it's so important to use it.
78;high;35;client;Mm-hmm.
78;high;36;therapist;The other thing i was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction. now, something i'd like you to think about is that, if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. um, honestly, i'd love to see you quit smoking for you too because, you know, as you know, it's not real good for you.
78;high;37;client;Yeah.
78;high;38;therapist;Uh, and it would certainly help her. um, but what i'd like you to do is to, kind of, keep an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler. and if she's still flaring up when you're around her, if there are any, if there is smoke on your clothes because it-it can flare her up.
78;high;39;client;Oh, even when it's just on my clothes?
78;high;40;therapist;Yeah. yeah.
78;high;41;client;She's that sensitive. if i realized that—
78;high;42;therapist;It-it-it-- yeah. it may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an eye on that. obviously, it would be- what would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking.
78;high;43;client;Right. um, so would it help, um-- you know, the thought of quitting smoking is a pretty daunting aspect.
78;high;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.
79;high;0;therapist;Something clicked, i'd had a bunch to drink and, uh, and i knew i'd messed up. i totally messed up.
79;high;1;client;How did you know you messed up?
79;high;2;therapist;Because i was- because i was right there, man. i was right there in the same place when i'd come home and i'd pop a couple of those pills, it was the same deal, like and i wanted to stay there. i wanted to stay exactly right there. and i just felt like i'd ruined everything. you know, erin's using the phone now, and he called me the next day and it was, uh, great, but i kinda felt ashamed of myself, and i don't want to feel that way again.
79;high;3;client;Was it that something happened, um, where you put something that was really important to you at risk? is that what that was about, um, when you say you felt guilty, uh, you felt bad talking to erin on the phone?
79;high;4;therapist;Because of what-- yeah, i guess, i think that's what i mean, yeah, yeah. because you know, i mean- i mean i could have stayed, i could have got, i could have got absolutely hammered and i could have done it every night for the rest of the week.
79;high;5;client;So you saw yourself putting something that was important to you at risk.
80;high;0;therapist;Jean, it's good to see you again.
80;high;1;client;Hello, doctor.
80;high;2;therapist;So, what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago?
80;high;3;client;Well, i did what we discussed. i did the journal-
80;high;4;therapist;Okay.
80;high;5;client;-for a week, uh, trying to mark down the-the difference in my smoking, being more aware when i had the urge, if i could stop the urge-
80;high;6;therapist;Mm.
80;high;7;client;-and i found it was okay. it got a little bit scary on the weekend because, uh, uh, the urge has kept on coming-
80;high;8;therapist;Sure.
80;high;9;client;To have a cigarette.
80;high;10;therapist;Sure.
80;high;11;client;But during the week, i was able to cut down at least two or three cigarettes a week, and that's just in one week. so-
80;high;12;therapist;So, you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes? that's amazing. i mean, given how much you were smoking.
80;high;13;client;Yeah.
80;high;14;therapist;So, you were able to keep the, uh, the journal?
80;high;15;client;Yes.
80;high;16;therapist;You-- sounds like you did that, and that allowed you to really focus on the time [unintelligible 00:00:57] delaying your cigarettes. so-so that's gone well. so, what are the things that are not going as well as you'd liked?
80;high;17;client;It just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend-
80;high;18;therapist;Right.
80;high;19;client;-and i was going out with friends and i was home a lot of the day-
80;high;20;therapist;Yeah.
80;high;21;client;-instead of at work. and i found that, um, it was really hard to stop those urges.
80;high;22;therapist;Okay. so, these automatic cigarettes, when you're socializing and you're-- you have time on your hands, really, are the problems that you're facing-
80;high;23;client;Yes.
80;high;24;therapist;-uh, and that you've noticed are more difficult than the others?
80;high;25;client;But i marked it in the book. uh, that's one thing i said to myself, i'll be honest in my marking down.
80;high;26;therapist;In marking it down, okay.
80;high;27;client;So, i'm gonna have to really be aware of the weekends. maybe get some kind of hobby or-or join some group or something on the weekends to keep me busy.
80;high;28;therapist;Okay. so, and you've thought about already, what you might do, such as getting a hobby. any other thoughts of what you might do to help you overcome this?
80;high;29;client;If i can just postpone it-
80;high;30;therapist;Okay.
80;high;31;client;"-and-and say, ""okay, i'm not gonna have it at home-"
80;high;32;therapist;Right.
80;high;33;client;"-i'll have it when i get to work or on the way to work."""
80;high;34;therapist;Right.
80;high;35;client;'cause i-i-i-
80;high;36;therapist;Sure.
80;high;37;client;And then, uh-uh, what i'd like to do is try not to smoke in my house.
81;high;0;therapist;Did you like how your parents raised you?
81;high;1;client;Tell me about how your parents raised you?
81;high;2;therapist;Tell me about how you've been feeling?
81;high;3;client;Okay. i guess i've been getting bigger.
81;high;4;therapist;Mm, what's that like for you?
81;high;5;client;Uh, scary i guess.
81;high;6;therapist;So you're feeling uncomfortable with changes in your body?
81;high;7;client;Yeah. i-i know there's something in there, i just don't know much about him.
81;high;8;therapist;Mm.
81;high;9;client;I know you want me to see the doctor, i haven't called yet.
81;high;10;therapist;Why do you think it makes you so hesitant to call?
81;high;11;client;I don't know. it seems overwhelming to me.
82;high;0;therapist;Would you like to answer some questions and kind of do a self-evaluation about how you're feeling around alcohol and the contraception?
82;high;1;client;Sure.
82;high;2;therapist;Okay. so we're working on a 10 point of scale 1 to 10, 1 being not important, 10 being very important. one being not confident, one being very confident. so on a scale of 1 to 10, which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the-- what risk limits?
82;high;3;client;I would say an eight.
82;high;4;therapist;You'd say an eight. okay. and on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels?
82;high;5;client;I would say a four.
82;high;6;therapist;Amount of four.
82;high;7;client;Mm-hmm.
82;high;8;therapist;Okay. and so let's look at those two. you're-you're thinking it's pretty important, but your confidence is down here, uh, a four, but it's not a one. what makes you confident that you can drink below risk levels and you remember what those are?
82;high;9;client;Um, i think it's because you've told me i'm at risk and i have alcoholism in my family and i really don't want to go down that path. so i'm-i'm confident that i can change that at this point.
82;high;10;therapist;Okay. so that gives you a good reason not to drink. okay. anything else?
82;high;11;client;Um, well, i have a group of friends that doesn't drink that i hang out with. and i think when i hang out with them, it's not an issue. so that also helps me.
82;high;12;therapist;So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk levels?
82;high;13;client;Yep.
82;high;14;therapist;Okay. anything else?
82;high;15;client;Nope.
82;high;16;therapist;Now let's look at your self-evaluation of your birth control. so now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control. so on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant?
82;high;17;client;I would say an eight.
82;high;18;therapist;An eight. okay. and on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you- that you can use effective birth control?
82;high;19;client;Every time,-
82;high;20;therapist;Every time.
82;high;21;client;Probably a six.
83;high;0;therapist;Hello, rick. welcome.
83;high;1;client;Kia ora.
83;high;2;therapist;Good to see you here. i see on your file that you're, uh, [unintelligible 00:01:18].
83;high;3;client;Yup. that's right.
83;high;4;therapist;What part of the [unintelligible 00:01:22] are you from?
83;high;5;client;I'm from down south.
83;high;6;therapist;Oh, okay.
83;high;7;client;Mm-hmm.
83;high;8;therapist;Right down the bottom? down bluff?
83;high;9;client;Yes sir. i'm from invercargill just short of bluff. all my family is still down there.
83;high;10;therapist;Oh, are they? so you were born down there and-
83;high;11;client;Mm-hmm.
83;high;12;therapist;Raised down there?
83;high;13;client;Mm-hmm. country boy.
83;high;14;therapist;Country boy. been up in christchurch how long?
83;high;15;client;I've been up here since i was 18.
83;high;16;therapist;Oh, so you've been here a while?
83;high;17;client;Just a little while. yeah.
83;high;18;therapist;Oh good. you got family out here?
83;high;19;client;Uh, just my own.
83;high;20;therapist;Just your own wh_nau here. [unintelligible 00:01:51]. well, rick, i'm sort of, uh, interested in that, you know, you and i are gonna been doing some work together for a while. i'm sort of wondering what sort of thoughts you'd be having on your way here today.
83;high;21;client;Um, i was thinking about what you might ask me, what i would say. i'm thinking about my kids, thinking about having to take a day off work.
83;high;22;therapist;Right.
83;high;23;client;It's a bit of a bitch.
83;high;24;therapist;Okay. i see you've had a bit of experience with, uh, coming to prevention services.
83;high;25;client;Mm-hmm.
83;high;26;therapist;What's that been like for you in the past?
83;high;27;client;Uh, it's been okay. um, it hasn't been bad.
83;high;28;therapist;Right.
83;high;29;client;I don't know. kind of nothing, really.
83;high;30;therapist;Okay. similar sort of offending in the past that's brought you back again this time?
83;high;31;client;Yeah.
83;high;32;therapist;One of the, um, things that i've learned over the years, rick, is that a lot of guys get to the doors out there and don't come inside and, um, you've come inside. what does that tell me about you?
83;high;33;client;Um, i hope that it says that i want to, um, make some changes.
83;high;34;therapist;Yeah.
83;high;35;client;Mm-hmm.
83;high;36;therapist;So is that different from when you've come in here before?
83;high;37;client;Yeah. and i still had to walk through those doors so-
83;high;38;therapist;Yeah.
83;high;39;client;-but, um, i just think about my kids, you know.
83;high;40;therapist;Yeah. so they're really important to you?
83;high;41;client;Yeah.
83;high;42;therapist;Yeah. and do you have your kids with you full-time or-
83;high;43;client;No. no, i don't. i see them, um, once a fortnight.
83;high;44;therapist;Okay. and what's it like for you?
83;high;45;client;It sucks.
83;high;46;therapist;Mm-hmm.
83;high;47;client;Yeah.
83;high;48;therapist;What would you really like to happen in terms of, uh, you and your children?
83;high;49;client;I just-- i'd love to be able to see them whenever i can, whenever i wanted to.
83;high;50;therapist;Yeah.
83;high;51;client;You know. i, um, they're my whole world and-and i've fucked things up.
83;high;52;therapist;Right.
83;high;53;client;So, you know.
83;high;54;therapist;So coming along to see me and you and i are doing some work together, then you're going on to do a program, how important is that gonna be for you and your children?
83;high;55;client;It's really important.
83;high;56;therapist;Mm-hmm. if i was to put it on a scale of say 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being really, really important, whereabouts on that scale would you you be?
83;high;57;client;It's, uh, um, it's hard because-because i'm, uh, i'm not a bad person. i've just done some stupid shit, but i'm not a bad person.
83;high;58;therapist;Right.
83;high;59;client;In-in regards to my kids, i'd be100- 100%.
83;high;60;therapist;Right.
83;high;61;client;If it means say, i can have my-- see my kids whenever i- whenever i want.
83;high;62;therapist;Yeah. what do you think it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this was really, really important to you and to them? that you gave this program 100%. well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?
83;high;63;client;Um, i-i-i'd hope that they'd be proud of me. i wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see me here though. but i- but i hope they would be proud of me.
83;high;64;therapist;Okay.
83;high;65;client;'cause i'm-- yeah.
83;high;66;therapist;Good. anybody else in your family that would be really proud of-- that you're taking these steps?
83;high;67;client;Um, oh, my mom.
83;high;68;therapist;Yeah. your is mum still down south?
83;high;69;client;Yeah.
83;high;70;therapist;Yeah. does she know that you're here today?
83;high;71;client;No.
83;high;72;therapist;So how might it be for her if she knew that you're talking like this today? that-- 'cause it sounds to me like you're really serious this time making some changes.
83;high;73;client;Yeah, i am.
83;high;74;therapist;Yeah.
83;high;75;client;I just, um, i don't- don't know where to s-- where to start. i don't know.
86;high;0;therapist;I just feel helpless about this whole deal.
86;high;1;client;You're hopeless about what's going on.
86;high;2;therapist;Mm. i just feel helpless about this whole deal.
86;high;3;client;You seem at a loss of where to go from here.
86;high;4;therapist;No one wants to help me.
86;high;5;client;You feel like people aren't willing to help.
86;high;6;therapist;No one wants to help me.
86;high;7;client;You feel alone.
86;high;8;therapist;Mm-hmm. i really shouldn't have done it.
86;high;9;client;You realize it's something you shouldn't have done.
86;high;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. i really shouldn't have done it.
86;high;11;client;You're feeling regretful.
86;high;12;therapist;Mm-hmm. i couldn't help myself.
86;high;13;client;Uh, it's something that just happened.
86;high;14;therapist;I couldn't help myself.
86;high;15;client;You're nervous that you've lost control of your behaviors.
86;high;16;therapist;It's actually been a fabulous week.
86;high;17;client;You've really had a good week.
86;high;18;therapist;It's actually been a fabulous week.
86;high;19;client;You seem excited about that.
86;high;20;therapist;Mm-hmm. i know who to hang out with, i'm not stupid.
86;high;21;client;You definitely know how to make good decisions.
86;high;22;therapist;I know who to hang out with, i'm not stupid.
86;high;23;client;You know that, um, positive peer influences have been helpful for you.
87;high;0;therapist;So let me tell you what i normally do in this, um, this interview, and we-we'll talk for up to maybe 20 minutes or so. normally what i do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week-
87;high;1;client;Mm-hmm.
87;high;2;therapist;-and then we just talk together about that. so, um, but i always like to just start with wherever you would like to start as well.
87;high;3;client;Um, yeah, i, [sigh] that, i mean, like, when i was doing those questionnaires, it was weird because, i mean, i guess i don't really think about, like, you know, the drinking being, like, this huge deal and i don't-
87;high;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.
87;high;5;client;-ever really think about, like-like, how much i drink.
87;high;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.
87;high;7;client;Um, and, like, fi- like filling out, like, how much i'm drinking every day, it was like, whoa, you know-
87;high;8;therapist;Hm.
87;high;9;client;-like, i just didn't ever really think about it, like, that i was-- like, if i try to actually count the drinks, it's, kind of, a lot, i mean, it's, kind of, a lot.
87;high;10;therapist;You were pretty shocked at what you learned about your patterns.
87;high;11;client;Well, yeah, 'cause, like, i also, kind of, thought that, like, i drink, like, about as much as my friends did and then, like, i went back and i was, like, talking to my roommate about it and i was, like, telling her that, you know, i was drinking, like, like 10 drinks on the weekends, like, including thursday, so like, thursday, friday-
87;high;12;therapist;Hm.
87;high;13;client;-saturday, sunday.
87;high;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.
88;high;0;therapist;For me.
88;high;1;client;So, um, everyone that comes on the south whisky program, we'd like them to pick at least three goals that they'd like to work on in the next 30 days. because what we will do is we will monitor you and we'll check in 30 days to see how you're going with your goals. so with that being said, we want you to pick something that is relevant for you, something that you're willing to work on. so with that being said, is there anything that you would like to change your work on either at home or school, um, [unintelligible 00:00:30]?
88;high;2;therapist;Um, i have to start getting the school on time for my first hour. i always miss that class.
88;high;3;client;Okay, so for you getting on time for first hour is something you'd like to work on the next 30 days?
88;high;4;therapist;Yes.
88;high;5;client;Okay. what a great goal. so why do you want to make this goal for yourself?
88;high;6;therapist;Uh, so people will get off my back.
88;high;7;client;And who are these people?
88;high;8;therapist;My mom she's always saying, you know, get to school. my po will be like, you know, if you don't get the school on time, i can bring you back in for sanctions and i don't want to go back in.
88;high;9;client;So that's something you definitely wanna avoid?
88;high;10;therapist;Yes.
88;high;11;client;Okay. so getting to school for your first hour is something that you're going to work on as your goal.
88;high;12;therapist;I will try.
88;high;13;client;So what are some specific steps you would need to take to get to school on time for first hour?
88;high;14;therapist;I can't ever get up in the morning. so that's hard and then by the time i do get up, and then i get ready and get dressed, i miss the bus. so then i usually end up walking or see if i can find a ride. so it could be a bunch of different reasons why i'm late.
88;high;15;client;Okay, so it's not just one major thing?
88;high;16;therapist;No.
88;high;17;client;So knowing that a couple of things can really get in your way, what do you think would work best for you to get to school on time? what do you know you need to do?
88;high;18;therapist;Get up on time would probably be a good start of making me get there on time.
88;high;19;client;What time would you need to get up then?
88;high;20;therapist;[sighs] if i'm gonna catch the bus i'll probably need to be up by 6:15 and sometimes that's just so hard to do, 'cause i go to bed so late and i don't know if i can do it.
88;high;21;client;So you're still kind of unsure if this is something that you could do yet you're saying you really wanna do it because you don't wanna go back for sanctions.
88;high;22;therapist;Right. i could try-
88;high;23;client;Okay.
88;high;24;therapist;And see how it goes.
88;high;25;client;Okay, so you're willing to at least attempt it?
88;high;26;therapist;Yes.
88;high;27;client;So what time would you have to go to bed at night to make sure you're up by 6:15?
88;high;28;therapist;I go about midnight now, so if i tried maybe 11:00. i can try 11:00.
88;high;29;client;Okay. okay, so you're willing to go to bed at 11:00 and then you're going to set your alarm for 6:15 the next morning?
88;high;30;therapist;Yes.
88;high;31;client;When would be a great day for you to start this?
88;high;32;therapist;Uh, either tomorrow or the next day.
88;high;33;client;Okay, so if i would write down here, um, what do you think- what would you want me to write? tomorrow or the next day?
88;high;34;therapist;Let's start tomorrow.
88;high;35;client;Tomorrow. okay, great. so who would be able to help you get to bed on time and make sure you're up on time by 6:15?
88;high;36;therapist;My mom.
88;high;37;client;Your mom.
88;high;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.
88;high;39;client;Okay. anything that your mom could do to help you with that?
88;high;40;therapist;[sighs] she can after my alarm goes off, if i don't get up, she could come in and wake me up and remind me that i said to you that i'm going to get up so that i have to do it.
90;low;0;therapist;So, tommy, i wanted to talk to because i was on facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party, and, you know, you're such a good kid. like, i don't know what you're doing drinking. it's going to ruin your life.
90;low;1;client;Um, i mean, it was just the, like a social gathering. it wasn't like i was looking for it, uh, the drinks were there and i-- all my friends were doing it and it was just-- it's-it's not something that i like do occa- on occasion, but whenever the opportunity presents itself, it-it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes.
90;low;2;therapist;But, tommy, there's so many consequences with drinking. you know, you're not even 21 yet, you could get arrested, you could, you know, have a drunk driving accident. you could, you know, mess up your schoolwork. you have such a bright future ahead of you. it just really, really concerns me.
90;low;3;client;I-i get what you're coming from, but i-i-i really did. i-i thought that i had it under control and i didn't let myself get too far gone. i-i didn't want to be, um, how do i put this? like, i want it to be in control and i wanted to make sure that all my friends were okay, so i didn't let myself drink too much.
90;low;4;therapist;There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. i mean, anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much, you know. like, think about it, think about all the things that can happen to you.
90;low;5;client;Yeah. i-i understand exactly what you're saying. and—
90;low;6;therapist;How much are you drinking?
90;low;7;client;I-i don't think i'm drinking that much. i mean, it's-it's mainly for social gatherings. like it's nothing that i do, like by myself or whatever. it's just the—
90;low;8;therapist;Is it like every weekend?
90;low;9;client;Every other weekends, i would say.
90;low;10;therapist;Tommy, i'm just so concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do?
90;low;11;client;Um, i-i guess i can. i-i can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and i-i do get you're coming from and—
90;low;12;therapist;Yeah. is-- are your friends the problem, like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you were partying with?
90;low;13;client;Yeah, i guess i haven't really put it on myself. i guess it's really been forced on their account. and i've just been following in their footsteps just to-- just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. and i just want to make sure that i'm getting every bit of the high school experience that i can.
90;low;14;therapist;Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? that's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and-and really doing what's best for you. and i just, you know, i really think you should think about making a big change here.
91;high;0;therapist;Hi, jean. i'm dr. selby. nice to meet you.
91;high;1;client;Good morning, doctor.
91;high;2;therapist;How can i help you today?
91;high;3;client;Well, doctor, i-i made an appointment with you finally, because i was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, copd.
91;high;4;therapist;Yes.
91;high;5;client;And although i didn't call right away. i really need some help in quitting smoking.
91;high;6;therapist;Right.
91;high;7;client;So i thought, well, this is my first step. so, uh, it's time to do something.
91;high;8;therapist;It's time to do something, okay. so you've been diagnosed by-
91;high;9;client;A respirologist.
91;high;10;therapist;A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now?
91;high;11;client;I'm- i'm really scared, uh, 'cause i don't feel well.
91;high;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.
91;high;13;client;I haven't felt well for a while. i'm getting coughing fits even when i'm on the telephone with customers.
91;high;14;therapist;All right. so it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened.
91;high;15;client;Mm-hmm. i-i don't know what i'm going to do about it.
91;high;16;therapist;Okay, okay. now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?
91;high;17;client;I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but i have a feeling i'm going to fail at this point in time. i don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself.
91;high;18;therapist;Okay. so what i'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing.
91;high;19;client;I don't know what to do. i've tried to quit smoking. i've had, uh, i've taken pills, i've taken the patch.
91;high;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.
91;high;21;client;I've gone through therapy. uh, nothing's helped. i finally- i went to the doctor. i was actually in the hospital. they took me to the hospital for a week. that's the longest i quit.
91;high;22;therapist;Right. so you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital.
91;high;23;client;I had no choice, i had no choice. and then the next day i was back to smoking again what i smoked.
91;high;24;therapist;Okay. let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that i can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you?
91;high;25;client;Uh, it's part of my life. it's, uh, i started smoking when i was 13, 14 at home. my parents smoked. all of their friends smoked. it was on television. everybody looked so grand.
91;high;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.
91;high;27;client;Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, i didn't really think about it. it's just an extension of me, i guess. it's-it's good for my nerves.
91;high;28;therapist;Right.
91;high;29;client;"I mean, i feel like it is. i know when i've got that package in my pocket, or i know if there- if i'm going through some stress, i say, ""oh, well, i'll have a cigarette and think this out."""
91;high;30;therapist;Sure. so, jean, i want to make sure that i've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. so it helps you calm down. it gives you something to do. it's been part of your image. you know, you feel sophisticated. you feel like a movie style. in fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. is that right?
91;high;31;client;That's right.
91;high;32;therapist;Okay. is there anything i missed?
91;high;33;client;Um, i enjoy it. it just- it relaxes me. it's great after a meal, um, for me-
91;high;34;therapist;Mm-hmm.
91;high;35;client;-we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family.
91;high;36;therapist;Right.
91;high;37;client;The people i work with, we go out in the courtyard-
91;high;38;therapist;Sure.
91;high;39;client;-have a cigarette and talk. that's how you make friends. a lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us.
91;high;40;therapist;So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. and it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette.
91;high;41;client;I-i never thought of it that way, but probably you're right.
91;high;42;therapist;You've told me what is good about smoking for you. uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you?
91;high;43;client;Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause i don't feel well.
91;high;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.
91;high;45;client;I haven't felt well for a while. i'm getting coughing fits even when i'm on the telephone with customers.
91;high;46;therapist;Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you?
93;high;0;therapist;So there are a lot of different directions that we could take. um, you've mentioned wanting to make changes in your physical activity. you've mentioned wanting to make changes in your eating habits and also just wanting more body confidence. um, what- what's on your mind is as far as a- as a change topic for the rest of our session today?
93;high;1;client;I think the activity piece is the kind of low-hanging fruit that i see. um, i feel like it's gonna be harder for me to change some of my nutrition habits right out the gate, but if i can get into maybe an activity routine, that that could be good to help maybe some of the other changes happen later.
93;high;2;therapist;Yeah. okay. so physical activity is feeling like the easiest change to look at first.
93;high;3;client;Yeah, i think so.
93;high;4;therapist;Great. so tell me a little bit more about your motivators for getting started in being more physically active. i know you shared energy levels and i know you've shared, um, that you'd like to see a boost in your mood and feeling less irritable and stressed. any other benefits that really make you wanna make this change right now?
93;high;5;client;Yeah, i think just to feeling like physically stronger, um, like physically more able. uh, last night i like struggled with the jar of salsa, like opening it. so i think that just stuff like that, um, you know, would be in addition to mood and being more productive and energy and all that stuff. um, yeah, that that would be a definite end goal for me too. and then really to like, i think if i am more active, i think my body image or my body confidence would improve also.
93;high;6;therapist;Yeah. so you're wanting to feel stronger so that you can open jars and other things and- and also just have a better sense of confidence.
93;high;7;client;Mm-hmm.
93;high;8;therapist;Great. so on a scale from zero to 10, zero being not at all ready to make a change in the area of physical activity, and 10 being let's- let's do this. i'm excited. i'm ready. um, where- where do you fall on that scale?
93;high;9;client;Hmm, i'd say i'm about an eight.
93;high;10;therapist;Okay. so you're- you're feeling fairly motivated.
93;high;11;client;Mm-hmm.
93;high;12;therapist;Uh, why didn't you pick a six?
93;high;13;client;Well, like i said, i just, i've identified like a lot of things that i think would be good. um, if i were to be more active and i definitely wanna have that improved mood and energy, um, and feel better about myself. um, so yeah, all of those things i think are what's really driving that- that rating.
93;high;14;therapist;Okay. you're noticing there- there are too many great benefits to being physically active and, um, today you've mentioned energy, mood, strength and body confidence.
94;high;0;therapist;Good, so, um, we're here today to talk just, uh, about whatever it is you'd like to talk about it.
94;high;1;client;Um, how about if we talk about, uh, the problem that i'm really having is, um, getting somebody motivated to do something, um, such as move out of my house.
94;high;2;therapist;Okay, so, um, there would be, so what you're, what you're attempting to do is, um, well-- tell me, i guess, uh, tell me a little bit more about it so i understand it a little bit more.
94;high;3;client;Well, i-i offered my home to somebody and, uh, for, you know, uh, a transitional period.
94;high;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.
94;high;5;client;You know, and it seems that, um, it's hard for me to be assertive and say i think the, um, the, uh, transitional period is- has come and it's beginning to time to transition. so.
94;high;6;therapist;So that's a really kind thing of you to do to take someone into your home like that when they need help like that. and, um, but right now, you're thinking that, uh, time is up you'd like to get this person, you know, you're-you're-you're ready to have him or her move out and have your place back to yourself.
94;high;7;client;Yeah, that's, it's absolutely right that i want, i-i want change but i'm not, i am kind of, like, weak in that area where it's, like, the ability to actually say the words. you're right, yeah. i'd like to be able to do that.
94;high;8;therapist;Mm-hmm. and what would, uh, what would help you get to the point of actually, um, booting them out?
94;high;9;client;Um. [sighs] i don't know, i'm-i'm, i guess, i'm kind of, um, i care about the person and, you know, there's a certain amount of comfortability of having somebody with you, you know, and i'm just, so, i guess i am at war with myself because part of me wants the comfort of having a companion and the other part of me is just, you know-- i-i cannot-- i am not really sure what i wanna do, you know.
94;high;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. so you kind of feel two ways about it. you-you'd like to, um, you feel like at some level that the time is up for that person to go, and on the other hand, there's a certain amount of security in having him in the house and in knowing he's around.
94;high;11;client;Yeah, you know, it's kind of, like, the old sock- song saying hit the road jack, don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more. [laughs] and—
94;high;12;therapist;But you're not quite ready if you wanna sing that song.
94;high;13;client;[laughs] well, first of all i think he would hit the road if i started singing that song 'cause i can sing. [laughs]
94;high;14;therapist;I thought you did a pretty nice job singing there right there, it's scary to be quite honest with you and i appreciate, i also appreciate your sense of humor in-in doing that.
94;high;15;client;Well, you know, in life you have to have a sense of humor in my- the way i view and otherwise, you know, i'd be like where's the news. [laughs] i mean, it's either—
94;high;16;therapist;That really helps you get through things is to be able to laugh about it.
94;high;17;client;Yeah, yeah, i have to laugh, i mean, even comedians say, you know, uh, most of-- what i've heard about comedians is that they are really not always that happy and they use that in a comical way to, you know, deal with life, so, yeah. [laughs] i kind of, maybe i should go into that. [laughs] like this girl—
94;high;18;therapist;Your new career.
94;high;19;client;Yeah, like this girl ruth that i know she's-she's, uh, got a serious job and she kind of does that on the side. [laughs]
94;high;20;therapist;So, um, what are the uh, uh, what would be the benefits to you right now to having him out of the house?
94;high;21;client;Mm. let's see. well, you know, i'm really not sure, i kind of, you know. um, i'm having a hard time with that. um.
94;high;22;therapist;Tell me a bit more about that.
94;high;23;client;Mm, well, i have to really think about it because-
94;high;24;therapist;Some guilt?
94;high;25;client;Yeah, yeah. maybe some guilt and i, um, uh, i just, you know, [sighs] i go back and forth a little bit, you know.
94;high;26;therapist;Uh-huh.
94;high;27;client;Yeah.
94;high;28;therapist;Cause you wanna do the right thing because you're- because you're a good person and that's a- that's a really important value to you is that you- is that you help people out.
94;high;29;client;Yeah, i-i- yeah. i mean i- thank you. i-i-i appreciate you saying that i'm a good person. like i feel i am. um—
94;high;30;therapist;But you've done your duty. duty is done.
94;high;31;client;Yeah. oops, it's just hard to- it's just hard to, um, er, yeah. i- my j- my job is done and i have to start to realize that i have to be a little bit more assertive, i think, and a little bit more, um, sure of myself.
94;high;32;therapist;And so, what have you done in order to start getting them to hit the road, jack?
94;high;33;client;Well, um, i've had co-conversations about with him and sometimes not-not so pleasant, but i'm-i'm just making, you know, 'cause i happen to sometimes just like hold things in. and then finally i- at-at one point i was really, you know, very logical about it. and then the other day i kind of got not so logical about it.
94;high;34;therapist;Okay.
94;high;35;client;[laughs]
94;high;36;therapist;So, uh, you were telling me earlier though that you've talked to some other people and he has some options about some other places to go to.
95;high;0;therapist;Right. hi, ruth, thank you for coming today. how are you?
95;high;1;client;Um, okay. just, i don't even know why i'm doing this anymore. i'm-i'm just so stupid. i'm such an idiot. i didn't know what the point of-of this is. i just- i just keep doing the same thing over and over, even though i know it can kill me. i just, i don't have any more willpower, ma'am. yeah, [foreign language].
95;high;2;therapist;Well, ruth, it sounds like you're very frustrated first of all. and you're saying that you're just tired. you've lost all your willpower.
95;high;3;client;Mm-hmm.
95;high;4;therapist;You don't want to continue.
95;high;5;client;No, it just seems that cutting myself is the only way out. and i just get suicidal thoughts and [foreign language], i'm just very, very like depressed and what's going on at home.
95;high;6;therapist;So you feel really, really like you've had it up to here.
95;high;7;client;Yeah.
95;high;8;therapist;Yeah. you're-you're tired. you're stressed. you feel so sad to the point that you're hurting yourself physically so that you can feel something other than what you're feeling right now.
95;high;9;client;Yes. sometimes a pain in-in the body. it's, uh, to [unintelligible 00:01:27] handle and-and the pain inside of me.
95;high;10;therapist;So you were in a lot of pain?
95;high;11;client;Yes. i am.
95;high;12;therapist;I'm sorry about that. it must be very, very frustrating to feel all that pain and not be able to do anything about it. and it seems like the only thing that you can do right now is to cry.
95;high;13;client;Yeah, yeah, suicide.
95;high;14;therapist;It's okay, ruth. i understand. pain inside.
95;high;15;client;[foreign language]
95;high;16;therapist;So your mom doesn't understand you and you don't have a dad, that's around?
95;high;17;client;Yeah, 'cause she's a single mom and she struggles a lot. i wanna help her, but i can't help her. so it just makes me sad. i feel like if i don't live anymore, she'll be okay. and she wouldn't have to worry about me or pay my stuff.
95;high;18;therapist;So you feel like your hands are tied, you feel like you're a burden to mom. she's a single parent. she works a lot. you have all of these problems in your life. and it sounds to me like you feel like you're just adding more problems to her.
95;high;19;client;Yeah.
95;high;20;therapist;And if you're not alive, that's gonna solve the issue for her. she'll do better.
96;high;0;therapist;Thank you for coming in today, katie. i'm looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe just wanna start off with just sharing a little bit about you and what brought you in today?
96;high;1;client;Uh, yeah, sure. um, i guess, well, my doctor referred me to see you. um, i guess he has some concerns about, um, my- my pregnancy and- and my baby. so, um, yeah, well, i'm doing what i'm told.
96;high;2;therapist;So you're following through on meeting with me today and you mentioned he has some concerns. can you tell me a little bit about that?
96;high;3;client;Uh, yeah, he is concerned about my alcohol intake.
96;high;4;therapist;Okay. and i'm wondering if you have any concerns about that.
96;high;5;client;Uh, no.
96;high;6;therapist;No. okay. so that's- that's not been an issue for you. uh, it is an issue for him and not for you at this point.
96;high;7;client;Mm-hmm.
96;high;8;therapist;Okay. so what about maybe sharing a little bit about your alcohol intake and maybe a little bit about what your- what your life's like a little bit for me today?
96;high;9;client;Um, okay. uh, well, i guess i drink like a glass of wine at supper every night, and just to, you know, relax a little with my friends if i go out. so wine has always been a kind of a family tradition with supper. so-
96;high;10;therapist;Okay.
96;high;11;client;Yeah.
96;high;12;therapist;So it was kind of been a part of your culture a little bit, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe takes the edge off a little bit and-
96;high;13;client;Yeah, and i, you know, i-i have friends who have drank during pregnancy, and-and i see articles on facebook and-and, you know, things that show that there isn't really a clear link between, you know, abnormalities or, uh, yeah, i just- i just think it's kind of an old wives' tale. so, you know, i'm independent and i'm gonna- i'm gonna do what i want, it's my body.
96;high;14;therapist;Okay. so you don't feel very comfortable with somebody telling you what you should be consuming, what kind of alcohol, and how much alcohol you should be consuming. and, um, it sounds like you've been getting some mixed messages, your doctor's saying there's no safe amount of alcohol you can drink, and asked you to come and see me. and then also, you've been checking- sounds like you've been checking things out a little bit.
96;high;15;client;Yeah. you know, i've looked it up to see, you know, kinda what i can say back, you know, to support my argument.
96;high;16;therapist;Okay.
96;high;17;client;Yeah, which is that, um, i'm going to do what i- do what i wanna do and what i know, right? so it's- yeah. i don't know, but, um, i'm here anyway. so-
96;high;18;therapist;So you know yourself best and you wanna be sort of the boss of your body and you don't want somebody else telling you what- what's okay and what's not okay. and it seems like you're not maybe too concerned right now about your substance use.
96;high;19;client;Nope. i never have been.
96;high;20;therapist;"Okay. and i'm wondering if that concern is coming from, ""it's been okay. i've got these messages from friends."""
96;high;21;client;Yep.
96;high;22;therapist;"""um, media has said it's okay to drink during alcohol. and so that concern, um, just sort of, i don't have it and, and maybe the doctor might be wrong."""
96;high;23;client;Mm-hmm. i think so.
96;high;24;therapist;You're not sure if he's sort of playing things up a little bit there?
96;high;25;client;Yeah. i mean, you know-
96;high;26;therapist;It might be a bit extreme to-
96;high;27;client;Yeah.
96;high;28;therapist;-to quit drinking. um, i'm just wondering, have you, um, would you be open maybe to just kind of taking a look at what canada's guidelines say about drinking? um, is that something you'd be open to?
96;high;29;client;Like right now?
96;high;30;therapist;Yeah.
96;high;31;client;Uh-
96;high;32;therapist;What if- uh, can i show you a brochure about that?
96;high;33;client;Uh, yeah, i guess.
96;high;34;therapist;Yeah?
96;high;35;client;Sure.
96;high;36;therapist;Well, if we take a look at the low-risk-alcohol drinking guidelines, what it says is for women, um, the safe limits are 10 drinks a week for women and 2 drinks a day. and that's if a woman isn't pregnant. and when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy. so really zero alcohol is, um, the woman should not be drinking any at all. and i'm just wondering what-what are your thoughts on that?
96;high;37;client;Well, you know, i've-i've heard these kinds of things before, but i just- i don't see the evidence. i don't see the risk, you know, i don't, you know, if someone can like prove to me, or show a direct link or something like that.
96;high;38;therapist;So when you see it here in kind of black and white, you're not sure if this is, uh, you know, enough-
96;high;39;client;It's the same thing.
96;high;40;therapist;To con- sort of convince you that-that it might be dangerous to be drinking through alcohol?
96;high;41;client;Yeah. it's just a fancy little brochure saying what i've already known, i've already heard.
96;high;42;therapist;So you feel like, um, what the doctor's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's just kind of blowing things up out of proportion a little bit.
96;high;43;client;Mm-hmm.
96;high;44;therapist;And it sounds like you-you've got some solid information already that alcohol, you know, has been safe to-to have during pregnancy. tell me about that information that you've-you've explored.
96;high;45;client;Um, well, i've looked up, um, different articles. um, and i- as i said, i personally know people who haven't had any problems. um, so that's about the extent.
96;high;46;therapist;Mm-hmm. you mentioned you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. so, um, those articles, is that something recent? um, you can tell me about that.
96;high;47;client;Like, uh, i don't like- have like a bibliography or anything.
96;high;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.
96;high;49;client;So i can't really- i don't really know when those were published. it's just stuff i've found, supporting the way that i look at it.
96;high;50;therapist;So you felt like, um, the information that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the information that your doctor shared or spoke to you about, and then this brochure kind of feels like that's challenging sort of your values.
96;high;51;client;Yeah. well, it's like all this brochure is saying is that, um, the same again, the same thing that i've heard, that the limits and that there is no safe amount of drink during pregnancy, but it's like, why not?
96;high;52;therapist;Mm-hmm.
96;high;53;client;"You know, it's kind of like the ""why"" that it's like-"
96;high;54;therapist;Mm-hmm.
97;high;0;therapist;Well, mr. smith, that's your medication sorted out.
97;high;1;client;Good.
97;high;2;therapist;Blood pressure's a little on the high side.
97;high;3;client;Yeah.
97;high;4;therapist;Okay. i wonder if i could raise the subject of your weight.
97;high;5;client;What?
97;high;6;therapist;I wondered if we could spend just a couple of minutes talking about your weight.
97;high;7;client;You are joking, aren't you? i mean, look, i've made time in my day to come here.
97;high;8;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;9;client;I'm kept in your waiting room-
97;high;10;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;11;client;-for 45 minutes.
97;high;12;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;13;client;It's not acceptable.
97;high;14;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;15;client;You know?
97;high;16;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;17;client;If i make an appointment with a client for 10:00-
97;high;18;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;19;client;-i expect them to start at 10:00, not 10:45.
97;high;20;therapist;Right, and you-- so you're busy enough, and—
97;high;21;client;Yeah, i've got other things to do. i've got accounts to do.
97;high;22;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;23;client;I've got clients they're coming in.
97;high;24;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
97;high;25;client;You know?
97;high;26;therapist;And it wasn't essentially easy for you to make the time to come down, and you had to wait in the waiting room, and now i raised the subject of weight just when you're thinking of going.
97;high;27;client;Yeah, i mean, okay, fair enough, um, i've got to have my blood pressure-
97;high;28;therapist;Yeah, yeah, yeah.
97;high;29;client;-medication changed, but i really haven't got time to talk about my weight. i mean, you know, i'm aware of my weight.
97;high;30;therapist;Right.
97;high;31;client;I'm aware of the problems, and i'm also aware of the solutions.
97;high;32;therapist;Right.
97;high;33;client;Um, so i don't really need a discussion, it's- it's just i've got too much to do at the moment, you know?
97;high;34;therapist;Right. and so it-it-it's been a bit of a rush for you coming in.
97;high;35;client;Yeah.
97;high;36;therapist;And, i- i'm sorry about the wait in the waiting room.
97;high;37;client;Well, it's b- it's bad form, you know?
97;high;38;therapist;Yeah, yeah, that's, um, and that- that's not easy for you, because you- you'd like to go really soon, and here i am asking you to spend just a couple of minutes with me.
97;high;39;client;Yeah, but basically i've got things to do.
97;high;40;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;41;client;I gotta get back to the office.
97;high;42;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;43;client;I've got a pile of work-
97;high;44;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;45;client;-that i've gotta deal with.
97;high;46;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;47;client;And every time- every moment out of my day-
97;high;48;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;49;client;-means that i have to work in the evening-
97;high;50;therapist;Yeah.
97;high;51;client;Or the weekends.
97;high;52;therapist;Yeah. it counts.
97;high;53;client;Well, when you're self-employed, you haven't got a choice, you know?
97;high;54;therapist;Yeah, exactly. exactly. it's up to you, just a couple of minutes.
97;high;55;client;Well, i'm here now, so yeah, okay, if it's a couple of minutes, yeah?
97;high;56;therapist;I promise.
97;high;57;client;Okay, because i really must get on.
97;high;58;therapist;I want- i wanted to simply ask you how you feel about it?
97;high;59;client;About what-what, losing weight? well, obviously, i-i want to.
97;high;60;therapist;Yep.
97;high;61;client;Um, yeah, i mean, who doesn't? i mean, i'm aware that i'm over my, uh, uh, b-b-b-balance weight, but i now know that it's causing problems. i mean, obviously, i get out of breath if i have to do something a bit howering, and i realize that i'm on this blood pressure-
97;high;62;therapist;Right.
97;high;63;client;-um, and-and maybe that's probably contributing to it.
98;high;0;therapist;Hi, mike. i'm kathy. appreciate you coming in today.
98;high;1;client;Hi, kathy, nice to meet you.
98;high;2;therapist;I'm sure there's so many other places you'd rather be than here today talking with me, but, um, you're here, and, um, thank you.
98;high;3;client;Okay.
98;high;4;therapist;Um, i wanted to ask you first how you're doing physically. um, i wanna make sure you're okay, if you feel okay. and, um, 'cause your-your safety is of, uh, most importance. so, if i could just ask you a couple of questions-
98;high;5;client;Sure.
98;high;6;therapist;-surrounding that, will that be okay?
98;high;7;client;Absolutely. yeah.
98;high;8;therapist;-um, we-we're-- you're here probably because of your speeding ticket. that's what i gathered.
98;high;9;client;Yeah. i got a dui, and i was speeding, uh, during the dui, obviously.
98;high;10;therapist;Oh. oh, okay. so, um, around that, um, do you ever feel-- you feel bad or-or sick when you're-- right now, is there something--
98;high;11;client;No, i'm fine. yeah
98;high;12;therapist;Do you feel okay. okay, good. i just wanted to make sure, um, uh, and, um, if the last time you-you drank was--
98;high;13;client;The night of the-the dui is the last time i drank.
98;high;14;therapist;Uh-huh, yeah.
98;high;15;client;And then, you know, um, i guess i'm here 'cause my lawyer wants me to go through an assessment-
98;high;16;therapist;Sure.
98;high;17;client;-uh, with you, and, um, i'm really not sure what it means or anything like that, but, uh, he said i'm supposed to come here and, uh, just tell the truth, is what he told me.
98;high;18;therapist;Oh, okay. well, i appreciate that.
98;high;19;client;Yeah.
98;high;20;therapist;Um, and also, if there's any-any-any information that you need from me, please, um, feel free to ask. um, that the reason that he asked you to come in was because of the blood alcohol level was 2.8.
98;high;21;client;Okay.
98;high;22;therapist;So, um, that was legally beyond the limit that you should be driving.
98;high;23;client;Is it bad, or is it high or?
98;high;24;therapist;Well, it's-it's high, uh, you know, they--
98;high;25;client;Okay.
98;high;26;therapist;For driving.
98;high;27;client;Okay
98;high;28;therapist;And so, um, the officer at the- at the scene, um, when you blew the 2.8, he-he did-- he-- there was a- there was a problem.
98;high;29;client;Yeah. he was, well, freaking out. he was--
98;high;30;therapist;Was he freaking out? yeah-yeah.
98;high;31;client;I think he was getting a little over the top a little bit, but, you know, again, whatever.
98;high;32;therapist;Right-right. so, um, i'll just ask you a couple of questions, um, if you don't mind about-about your drinking. and-and your-- so, um, you said the couple was two weeks ago was the last time you drank?
98;high;33;client;Yes.
98;high;34;therapist;Yeah. okay. and, um, that night, what was it that you-you drank and, how much?
98;high;35;client;Uh, my friend was having a, um- a get together as it was birthday party in, uh, downtown, and, uh, you know, it's not like it's a normal thing, but, uh, i did drink too much that night. you know, i just, uh-- and i used poor judgment. i shouldn't have driven that night.
98;high;36;therapist;Right. yeah. um, i was-- maybe, you could tell me about how much you drank.
98;high;37;client;Um, i don't really remember. i know, uh, i dunno, i probably had five or six drinks, i would think, something like that.
98;high;38;therapist;Mm-hmm. five, six drinks, like?
98;high;39;client;Um, yeah, they were a little bigger than that. i don't really-- i wasn't really counting, so, i don't really know.
98;high;40;therapist;Oh, okay. so, i guests maybe five or six.
98;high;41;client;Five or six, something like that. yeah.
98;high;42;therapist;Um, yeah. and-and, w-what were the drinks, were?
98;high;43;client;Um, absolute vodka-
98;high;44;therapist;Hmm.
98;high;45;client;And seven off. yeah.
98;high;46;therapist;Oh, okay. so, um, you said that it was pretty much just five or six. do you-- how often do you use that? and you said it's not a-
98;high;47;client;Yeah.
98;high;48;therapist;Not a normal occasion for you to drink that much?
98;high;49;client;Normally i drink one or two, and that's kind of it, you know, this one i did, uh- you know, i did feel a little drunk when i was- you know, when i was drinking, i just, uh, used poor judgment. i really shouldn't have drove.
98;high;50;therapist;Right. yeah. um, so, you usually don't drink that much. um, on an average, maybe a week, how much would you say you drink? just--
98;high;51;client;Um, sometimes i drink, um, you know, maybe one or two, and then i- and then i won't drink for a while, you know. so, it's not really a-- there's not really a pattern-
98;high;52;therapist;Uh-huh
98;high;53;client;-you know, it's not really like a uh- it's not a habit, you know,
98;high;54;therapist;Right.
98;high;55;client;I-i don't know if i would consider myself alcoholic. you know, i just, uh, um, you know, again, it was poor judgment.
98;high;56;therapist;Right. so, it doesn't get in the way of your-
98;high;57;client;Oh, no.
98;high;58;therapist;Every day.
98;high;59;client;Absolutely not. mm-mm.
98;high;60;therapist;Right. oh, that's good.
98;high;61;client;Yeah.
98;high;62;therapist;So, um, looking back, mike, uh, when was it that you started thinking that when you did use alcohol, um, most in your life?
98;high;63;client;Um, there was really not a time that i, uh-- i don't know. i-i don't understand the question really. i mean, it-- there really wasn't-- i don't really drink on a normal basis, so, i don't know-- [crosstalk]
98;high;64;therapist;So, that is- that is a complete, uh-- a question that is even applicable?
98;high;65;client;Yeah.
98;high;66;therapist;Okay.
98;high;67;client;Yeah.
98;high;68;therapist;That's fine.
98;high;69;client;Yeah.
98;high;70;therapist;That's fine. okay. um, so, what about the, uh- the first dui, could you tell me a little bit about that? this was your second one?
98;high;71;client;Yeah.
98;high;72;therapist;And so, that's sort of why i was asking about it earlier in your life if that was a--
98;high;73;client;It seems like every time that i, uh, do drink more than a couple of drinks, i tend to get in trouble. and, the two times that i did, i got in trouble both times. [crosstalk]
98;high;74;therapist;It was those two times. yeah.
98;high;75;client;Yeah, pretty much. i mean, it's-- it sounds strange, i know, but, uh--
98;high;76;therapist;It sounds like bad luck.
98;high;77;client;Yeah. actually, that-that's followed me around pretty much my whole life, the bad luck thing.
98;high;78;therapist;Yeah.
98;high;79;client;But the-the-the-the-the alcohol hasn't really at all.
98;high;80;therapist;Oh, okay.
98;high;81;client;Yeah.
98;high;82;therapist;But just that bad luck?
98;high;83;client;Yeah.
98;high;84;therapist;Yeah. is there alcohol with the- with-- goes hand in hand with the bad luck or just--
98;high;85;client;Sure seems like it. yeah. it sure seems like that.
98;high;86;therapist;Yeah. oh, okay. so-so, what about that? the-- is there other incidences that you could think of that seems, uh, um, alcohol was there, and then your luck just sorta took a-a turn, or it was just those two times?
98;high;87;client;Um, you know, i don't really, um-- i-i don't really, uh, get into a situation where i-i-i drink too much. um, you know, again, i-i realize it's my second dui, but,, um, uh-uh, it isn't something that, um, is like a normal everyday process for me.
98;high;88;therapist;Mm-hmm.
98;high;89;client;Um, you know, normally when i drink, i drink one or two drinks and then i stop. um, so, it's not like it's, um-- you know, it's not like it's something that has become a problem in my life, you know.
98;high;90;therapist;Oh, good. oh, good. and-and so, where do you usually, um, have your drinks? is it at home or, uh, out-out for, uh- after work, social drinking?
98;high;91;client;Um, it's normally social.
98;high;92;therapist;Mm-hmm.
98;high;93;client;Yeah. it's normally social. it would be, you know, maybe in events or something like that is normally when i would, um, maybe drink more than one or two.
98;high;94;therapist;Mm-hmm.
98;high;95;client;I guess i should probably just call a taxi cab or something, you know. that way, i wouldn't have this problem.
98;high;96;therapist;Would that help?
98;high;97;client;Um, probably, i think that would help. i think that would be something that i should, uh- i should work on.
98;high;98;therapist;So, it sounds like you've already been thinking about, uh, ways to-to get around safely.
98;high;99;client;Yeah. yeah, or i can just stay home probably too. if i was gonna drink, i could probably stay home, then i wouldn't get in trouble either.
98;high;100;therapist;You have been giving this a lot of thought.
98;high;101;client;Yeah, a little bit.
98;high;102;therapist;Yeah, good.
98;high;103;client;Yeah, obviously, because i just don't-- you know, i don't like getting in trouble, and i don't, uh--
98;high;104;therapist;Trouble's not fun.
98;high;105;client;Yeah.
98;high;106;therapist;No.
98;high;107;client;Yeah.
98;high;108;therapist;Yeah. so, tell-tell me a little bit more about, um, when you fi-- if you'd find yourself, and then that-that thought comes about maybe doing something other than getting in the- in the car, does that come and go, or-or is it something that you think you-- next time you might do?
98;high;109;client;Um, oh, i'll never get in the car when i'm drinking again. that-- yeah. i-i would never do that again.
98;high;110;therapist;This, it-- what-what-what was different?
98;high;111;client;Uh, i don't want to lose my license, you know.
98;high;112;therapist;Hmm.
98;high;113;client;I don't, uh, you know, i don't wanna lose my license.
98;high;114;therapist;Wow. you-you need your license-
98;high;115;client;Yeah.
98;high;116;therapist;To get around. you need your license for work.
98;high;117;client;Well, and then i-i sell cars for a living too, so--
98;high;118;therapist;Oh.
98;high;119;client;-um, you know, that would be, um-- you know, i don't wanna lose my job either. you know, i think those would kind of be connected together.
98;high;120;therapist;Mm-hmm.
98;high;121;client;And, you know, i-- you're not gonna call my work or anything for this, are you?
98;high;122;therapist;No.
98;high;123;client;Oh, okay.
98;high;124;therapist;No, no. that's--
98;high;125;client;All right.
98;high;126;therapist;That would be entirely up to you, um, to-to have that.
98;high;127;client;Okay. i just didn't know how that worked.
98;high;128;therapist;Oh, no.
98;high;129;client;Because i think if they found out, i might, you know, be in jeopardy with my job. so--
98;high;130;therapist;Well, you're here. and-and-and i have you give, uh-uh, credit for that. it took a lot to come in today and, um, when, um- when somebody is actually talking safety for themselves, which i-i hear you saying, um, calling a taxi or-or staying home.
98;high;131;client;Yeah.
98;high;132;therapist;So, what does staying home look like for you? is that something that-- you know, you-you talked about drinking at an event. would staying home be--
98;high;133;client;Well, you know, the super bowl is coming up, and that might be an opportunity where, you know, i might-- i could see myself maybe drinking that day, you know.
98;high;134;therapist;Mm-hmm.
98;high;135;client;So, maybe i would just, uh-- i think i'll just have people come over to my house instead of going somewhere else, you know.
98;high;136;therapist;That would work for you?
98;high;137;client;Yeah, i think so, and probably a smarter thing to do. i don't wanna go through this again, you know.
98;high;138;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
98;high;139;client;Yeah.
98;high;140;therapist;Uh, so, uh, would people come and drink at your house, and then they would be fine with that?
98;high;141;client;I think so.
98;high;142;therapist;Yeah.
98;high;143;client;Sure.
98;high;144;therapist;Yeah.
98;high;145;client;Yeah.
98;high;146;therapist;So, an event at your house.
98;high;147;client;There you go.
98;high;148;therapist;Yeah, good. that sounds good. mike, has there even been, if any, um, a time in your life when you've thought about, um, not drinking at all?
98;high;149;client;For my first dui, i did, uh-- i didn't drink at all for about six months. and, um, i-i-i just didn't think that, um, i really had a problem with it, so, you know, i-i did start drinking again. but, you know, again, it wasn't uh-- you know, it was a little different last time, because i was drinking a little more last time than, you know, now. i don't really drink as-as much as i used to drink, you know, um, and, you know, after you know, i quit for six months, so i kind of knew that i didn't really have a problem.
98;high;150;therapist;Right. six months. that's a long time.
98;high;151;client;Yeah.
98;high;152;therapist;What were those six months like for you?
98;high;153;client;Um, i know it was kind of strange. my friends didn't really hang out with me too much. um--
98;high;154;therapist;Friends?
98;high;155;client;Yeah. you know, i, uh.
98;high;156;therapist;Whi-which? if you don't mind me asking, which friends were those? i don't mean to get too personal, but, the friends that normally drank with you or just your-
98;high;157;client;No, my friends.
98;high;158;therapist;Social circles. okay.
98;high;159;client;Just my social circle, i guess, uh--
98;high;160;therapist;Wha-wha-what do you think made-made them n-not hang out with you?
98;high;161;client;Probably 'cause i didn't- i wasn't drinking with them, i guess. i don't really know. i mean, it seemed, uh--
98;high;162;therapist;Did you ask them?
98;high;163;client;Um, no. i really couldn't because my girlfriend really wouldn't let me hang with them. you know? i mean, it was, uh-- she said that if i, you know, kept hanging out with them guys, that she wasn't gonna be with me anymore. and i just thought that it was better for me to, you know, calm down for a little bit and, uh, maybe things would get better with us, you know.
98;high;164;therapist;And your girlfriend's important to you-
98;high;165;client;Sure.
98;high;166;therapist;And that relationship was important to you.
98;high;167;client;Well, it was until she left, you know.
98;high;168;therapist;At the time it was important, yeah.
98;high;169;client;Yeah.
98;high;170;therapist;Is it-- why'd she leave?
98;high;171;client;Uh, she left when i started drinking again.
98;high;172;therapist;Oh, after the six months.
98;high;173;client;After the six months, she, uh-- you know, it's kinda, i dunno, she just said that it wasn't gonna work out, and, uh, she decided not to continue with the relationship.
98;high;174;therapist;Oh, okay. so-so, um, you started drinking again, and then she left?
98;high;175;client;Uh, it was about the same time. i really don't know which came first. it was about the same time. uh, we were getting in a lot of arguments. i just didn't quite feel myself. you know, i-i-i wasn't-- my friends weren't around. i, uh-- you know, i missed going out with them.
98;high;176;therapist;You felt isolated?
98;high;177;client;Yeah. it was kind of weird 'cause i felt like she was trying to control me, and, uh- and uh, you know, i, uh-- and she was telling me what to do all the time, and i just, uh, didn't feel right about the whole situation. so, it was pretty much, we both decided, you know, that it just wasn't the right thing to do, so.
98;high;178;therapist;And, so you're-you're an independent guy-
98;high;179;client;Sure.
98;high;180;therapist;-and, no one's going to tell you what to do.
98;high;181;client;Well, i guess. sure. yeah.
98;high;182;therapist;Yeah. so, have, uh-- so then, you started drinking again, and that was-- if you could just kind of give me a little timeframe of how long ago that was, that-that six months of complete--
98;high;183;client;[clear throat] well, let's see. the first one was, uh, three years ago, and then, um, this one was a few weeks ago, so, um, it's been a few years, you know.
98;high;184;therapist;Absolutely. yeah.
98;high;185;client;Yeah. it's been a few years
98;high;186;therapist;So, in-in what ways has, uh, drinking, um, sort of, uh-- what is kind of the good things about drinking since those couple of- those couple of years, and then-then maybe not so good things?
98;high;187;client;I don't really know that i can really compare good or bad. i just, uh-- you know, i just drink to be social, you know, i don't know that it really changes anything about me. it just, uh-- you know, i just drink to be social, you know.
98;high;188;therapist;Mm-hmm. and those friends that were not hanging around with you, did they come back?
98;high;189;client;Yeah, absolutely. yeah. as soon as my girlfriend left, i could go out with them again, you know. [laughter]
98;high;190;therapist;Did they not get along with your girlfriend?
98;high;191;client;Well, she didn't want me going out with them.
98;high;192;therapist;Yeah.
98;high;193;client;She thought that they really--
98;high;194;therapist;She was separate then from your other friends and-
98;high;195;client;Yeah.
98;high;196;therapist;-those relationships just didn't come together?
98;high;197;client;She blamed the first dui on them. she said, you know, because i was out with them, that it was pretty much, you know, they-they made me drink too much that night.
98;high;198;therapist;And what do you think?
98;high;199;client;I think she was right on that. yeah, absolutely.
98;high;200;therapist;So, you-you--
98;high;201;client;I mean, if they wouldn't have gave me those shots, you know, towards the end of the night, i would've been all right. you know, i could have drove, and i wouldn't have, uh- i wouldn't have hit that mailbox.
98;high;202;therapist;You would have been fine if they didn't- if they didn't give you those-those shots. yeah.
98;high;203;client;Yeah.
98;high;204;therapist;Oh, so, the-the-the mailbox, where did that come in? that was the-
98;high;205;client;That was--
98;high;206;therapist;First dui that got you.
98;high;207;client;Yeah. i was on-- it was like i was a couple of blocks away from the house and i, uh, rolled up on the neighbor's lawn and i took out their mailbox.
98;high;208;therapist;That must have been scary.
98;high;209;client;I don't really remember too much of that night.
98;high;210;therapist;Oh, that was blackout type?
98;high;211;client;Uh, i don't know if i was blacked out, but i just don't remember a lot of it.
98;high;212;therapist;Right. yeah.
98;high;213;client;I wouldn't really call it a blackout. i just don't really-
98;high;214;therapist;Oh, okay.
98;high;215;client;Remember how that happened.
98;high;216;therapist;I'm-i'm sorry. i didn't mean to assume that-
98;high;217;client;Yeah.
98;high;218;therapist;It was blackout that-- forgive me for that.
98;high;219;client;Yeah. yeah. it's all right.
98;high;220;therapist;Um, so, that it was sort of after that that the girlfriend-- your girlfriend, i don't know, well, her name. um, your girlfriend decided-- the mailbox and she's--
98;high;221;client;Yeah, mary-mary, just [crosstalk] well, after-after i got the-the-- after i hit the mailbox-
98;high;222;therapist;Mm-hmm.
98;high;223;client;-um, i stopped drinking for, you know, like about six months, and, uh, you know, and we were trying to work things out, but it just didn't-
98;high;224;therapist;Yeah.
98;high;225;client;-it just didn't work.
98;high;226;therapist;Oh.
98;high;227;client;I think she became a little too possessive at that point.
98;high;228;therapist;Yeah. you felt like she was the only person that, um, you had in your life, you needed your friends and--
98;high;229;client;Um, i think she just wanted to control me and i was tired of being controlled.
98;high;230;therapist;No one likes to be controlled, uh, yeah. yeah. uh, and, in what ways, well, did you feel that, um, uh, at any time, did you feel controlled by your friends. you said they-they made you drink those shots. that-that sounded like maybe you felt a little controlled? but-- [crosstalk]
98;high;231;client;No, i was-- they just-- no, they weren't- they weren't really controlling me. they just-- they shouldn't have given me the last couple shots, 'cause you, they-they knew i was pretty, you know, uh, messed up before that. so-
98;high;232;therapist;Yeah.
98;high;233;client;-you know, that when they- when they-- you know, when they gave me the last, you know, couple shots, that kind of put me over the edge.
98;high;234;therapist;Right, they weren't looking out for your best interest at that point.
98;high;235;client;Pretty much, pretty much.
99;high;0;therapist;Steve, before we're done with our visit today, i was wondering if you'd be willing to take a few minutes to talk about your drinking.
99;high;1;client;Okay, like what?
99;high;2;therapist;Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was great. thank you very much. i just wanted to review a couple of things on here. i noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. so six or more drinks, it says on here.
99;high;3;client;Mm-hmm.
99;high;4;therapist;Does that sound realistic?
99;high;5;client;Yeah, uh, on the weekends?
99;high;6;therapist;Okay, okay. i just wanted to let you know, i'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. we know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and i was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?
99;high;7;client;No, i guess i haven't really thought much of it. um, you know, i don't really think i drink that much in the first place-
99;high;8;therapist;Mm-hmm.
99;high;9;client;-so i have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety.
99;high;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.
99;high;11;client;In fact, on the nights when i don't drink, i-i have a harder time going to sleep.
99;high;12;therapist;Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep.
99;high;13;client;Well, i, yeah, i guess i do have abo-about 2:00 am, i tend to wake up on the nights i drink too much.
99;high;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. well, i just wanted to just show you this little chart here. for your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. and, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. and you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. the way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two.
99;high;15;client;Jeez, no. i didn't think i was that bad.
99;high;16;therapist;That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. on a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being i don't want to change at all, and 10 is i really want to change?
99;high;17;client;I don't know. i mean, this is all news to me. i've, i don't want to do anything to put myself at risk and i've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. i guess i'd put myself right in the middle of the five.
99;high;18;therapist;Well, that's great. that's halfway there. what kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower?
100;high;0;therapist;There, um, what brings you in today?
100;high;1;client;I don't know. i'm just having a little bit of, uh, having a little bit of trouble dealing with, uh, my criminal history and, uh, you know, trying to stay on the right path, but, you know, um, it's just- it gets, you know, it gets kind of overwhelming, you know. um, i really wanna be, you know, a good productive member of society, but at the same time, you know, i got this background that nobody will overlook, you know. so it kinda makes it like, well, what, you know, do i go back to what i know?i mean, you can only work for $5, $6, $7 an hour for so long, and it's really frustrating. it's causing, uh, some anger issues to resurface and some depression to resurface and, um, you know, and, um, i don't wanna fall back, you know.
100;high;2;therapist;It's really getting in the way of you becoming who you wanna be.
100;high;3;client;Yes, it is.
100;high;4;therapist;Yeah. so what-what-what about your criminal record is blocking you from getting where you wanna be?
100;high;5;client;I don't know what about it is, um—
100;high;6;therapist;There's a, uh, your record has a conviction?
100;high;7;client;Yeah. it has a felony conviction on it.
100;high;8;therapist;Okay. ah, there's-
100;high;9;client;And, uh—
100;high;10;therapist;The big trouble. yeah.
100;high;11;client;"Yeah, it is. and it's- i hadn't anticipated that it would have been-- you know, so at the time, it was just like, ""okay, cool. i'm not going to jail."""
100;high;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.
100;high;13;client;You know, and, um, now, it's like, okay, so this is more like a life sentence than it was a four-year sentence that they were offering. you know, i mean, i think it would have been bad either way, but, um, i hadn't anticipated that this was gonna be this difficult, especially since i went back to school and, you know, uh, got a degree and actually want to do, you know, some, um, corporate level or, you know, professional type of work.
100;high;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. so when you, um, when you put in applications or anything like that, the felony con-conviction, whether you know it or not, seems to knock you out of the ballpark. you're not even considered as an applicant?
100;high;15;client;No, i'm not. um, in situations where i don't know about it, i don't know about, i mean, if i'm not considered because of that, i probably-- um, you know, that sucks too. don't get me wrong. i mean, i-i don't- i don't get callbacks a lot because of that issue-
100;high;16;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
100;high;17;client;- i'm sure. the ones that really count are-are-are, you know, are kind of just, you know, uh, making me so angry and, you know, kind of spilling over into the rest of my life or the ones that i get face face, especially after a really good interview. and,
100;high;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.
100;high;19;client;"Black and white. it just stops right there. ""i'm sorry. i can't really do much for you. i-- you have to go,"" you know, and it's—"
100;high;20;therapist;So do you- do you, um, put out there about the felony conviction before you even go for the interview?
100;high;21;client;"No. i mean, there's different situations, you know. sometimes they ask and, you know, i'll say something like, you know, ""we'll discuss at interview"". uh, sometimes, there are situations where if i probably put that, i don't get a callback and those situations i don't know about. you know, but there are also times where i get an interview through, um, you know, uh, uh, some sort of connection or something, or like a buddy of mine or a family member will send me on an interview. you know, i don't have to fill it out- fill out an application for that. they just usually, you know, give you the interview. and at the end-"
100;high;22;therapist;Seems like it's a done deal.
100;high;23;client;Yeah. it seems like it's a done deal. you just have to go through the motion of having the interview. and then-
100;high;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.
100;high;25;client;"-when i go through the interview and it goes well, and they're like, ""okay, well, you know, i think we can do something"" and then, ""here, sign this, sign that,"" and the other thing. and it's like, but we just had a great, you know, i mean, i qualify. like"
100;high;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.
100;high;27;client;And
100;high;28;therapist;So you didn't hurt anybody.
100;high;29;client;No, i didn't.
100;high;30;therapist;You didn't hurt anything, right?
100;high;31;client;It's really frustrating because-
100;high;32;therapist;Yeah.
100;high;33;client;-it's almost like i-i don't wanna give up, but it's like, i'm not given any other choice, you know?
100;high;34;therapist;Yeah, 'cause you're-you're, especially with going back to school and having done all that footwork and stuff. i mean, you really have something to offer somebody.
100;high;35;client;I do, yeah.
100;high;36;therapist;Yeah. and, um, and at the time the big crisis was actually maybe prison and all the crisis around the arrest and-and, uh, you know, it's like you're a leper and the leper colony.
100;high;37;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;38;therapist;Um, have there been any times when you've started the interview with that conversation so that you don't even have to go through the whole thing and then get rejected?
100;high;39;client;Not that i can think of, no.
100;high;40;therapist;Mm-hmm.
100;high;41;client;I think—
100;high;42;therapist;What do you think would happen if you did that?
100;high;43;client;Probably get booted out right away-
100;high;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.
100;high;45;client;-you know? um—
100;high;46;therapist;Would that be, um, what would they be like versus getting through this great interview, knowing you're-you're good for the job and all that kind of stuff, and then they boot you out?
100;high;47;client;Well, it's-it's sucks either way. you know what i mean?
100;high;48;therapist;Mm-hmm. it's, uh, i mean the lesser of two evils is that what we're getting at-
100;high;49;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;50;therapist;-you know what i mean? if it's gonna make things more efficient like as if-if you're what you're trying to say is if that's something that i could do and then if they get past it, then now i know that there's an actual intention by the hiring people to hi
100;high;51;client;Right. if that's a deal-breaker and you both know it from the very beginning, i'm wondering if then really the interview is really something else. i mean, whether they get the job would truly be based on the interview and not-not your criminal record.
100;high;52;therapist;Yeah, i think as far as maybe efficiency, you know, weeding out the things, not wasting my time, you know, but i had to tell you something, a lot of the people that don't care about that type of thing-
100;high;53;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;54;therapist;-are not the sort of jobs that i really wanna be doing. you know what i mean? um, i don't know, it's just really frustrating.
100;high;55;client;Not like you're working for the government or for a bank or, you know, the fbi where- those are not things you're applying for. they're jobs where you would wonder why a-a non-violent felony would even--
100;high;56;therapist;Be an issue.
100;high;57;client;Right.
100;high;58;therapist;Right, and then the other thing is anybody that i might tell that to-
100;high;59;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;60;therapist;-that doesn't care-
100;high;61;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;62;therapist;-are probably not jobs that, you know, are worth going to get the interview.
100;high;63;client;Mm-hmm, you didn't go to college for that.
100;high;64;therapist;Right.
100;high;65;client;Mm.
100;high;66;therapist;Do you know what i mean? if i want to work at a moving company and i tell them off the bat, you know, from the gate, i tell them i have a felony conviction, just so you know before the interview and they don't really mind. i mean, that's great, you know, but at the same time, i don't- i'm not looking to be a mover or-
100;high;67;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;68;therapist;-a burger flipper or something like that. not that there's anything wrong with it, but i feel like i have a little bit more to offer-
100;high;69;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;70;therapist;-you know, and, um, i don't know, it's a really, it's-it's like being caught between a rock and a hard place.
100;high;71;client;Mm-hmm. so, what have you looked into about, um, you know, advocacy in that area or expungement or anything like that?
100;high;72;therapist;I have done, and my eyes have, you know, just become like mush after all the reading i've done on this situation.
100;high;73;client;What did you find out?
100;high;74;therapist;I found out that i have the type of, um, felony that's expungable, i don't even have the type that's sealable. i have apparently the type that has to go on the governor's desk next to death row, you know, inmates or the candidates for, um, a gov- a governor's, uh, pardon. i-- that's what it all boils down to is that i have a class one felony-
100;high;75;client;Uh-huh.
100;high;76;therapist;-that needs to be, if any, you know, options, the only option i have is for, um, governor's clemency and i can't figure out why because it's-it's, i mean, i just, i maybe there is a loophole somewhere, i don't know.
100;high;77;client;I-i didn't know that. so i, you know, i know a little bit about it, um, and not, yeah. so that's-that's very interesting. oh, what about advocacy groups?
100;high;78;therapist;I've looked into, um, a fe- um, i've looked into a few groups that are supposedly helping convicted felons get-
100;high;79;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;80;therapist;Work.
100;high;81;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;82;therapist;Um, again, the-the only-- i mean, i think what i saw was a whole bunch of, you know, dead end jobs.
100;high;83;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;84;therapist;And the other thing that i saw was that it was very politically charged. you know, i didn't think that, um, i was, uh, you know, allowed to kind of get an interview right away with one of those counselors that they offer. um, i-- it just didn't seem like a type of place that was willing to help, you know. and-and, uh, i saw that there was a lot of, um, i wouldn't say racism but i would say a little bit of racial favor, i suppose. and, uh, i found it really hard to get in and to get an interview with a counselor to match me up with a job. um, i think that those-those types of groups are cool if they work. i just haven't had any luck with, um- at working with- through that group.
100;high;85;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;86;therapist;You know?
100;high;87;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;88;therapist;Um, you know, i don't know. i don't know if there's anything else out there.
100;high;89;client;Mm-hmm. so you're-you're middle eastern. so you wonder-- i-i bet you've had experiences where you really have experienced some absolute racism and prejudice because of that.
100;high;90;therapist;Mm-hmm.
100;high;91;client;And then, um, you walk into these places and they might just be almost storefront-
100;high;92;therapist;Mm-hmm.
100;high;93;client;Type places. and the job market is terrible.
100;high;94;therapist;Right. it's-it's, uh-- there is a lot stacked up against me.
100;high;95;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;96;therapist;Let's just put it like that.
100;high;97;client;Mm-hmm. mm-hmm.
100;high;98;therapist;You know, uh, but that isn't—
100;high;99;client;What do you have going for you?
100;high;100;therapist;Well, that's what-- yeah. that's-- i mean, uh, i'm able to, um-- i'm able to carry a conversation.
100;high;101;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;102;therapist;So at some point, i would imagine that maybe i strike up conversation with the right person-
100;high;103;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;104;therapist;-that would probably want to hire me regardless of that sort of thing. um, i think that at the this point in time, that it doesn't really matter what degree you have. i don't believe that it matters where you went to school. i think it's all about who you
100;high;105;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;106;therapist;-and getting jobs. and i think that, um, if i continue to, you know, go to school and, uh, you know, uh, get time from that felony, you know. so it's been seven years now and—
100;high;107;client;It's a long time.
100;high;108;therapist;Yeah. and at some point, i probably don't even have to report it, you know, and i have that going for me. it's been seven years. i have the fact that i'm, you know, uh, good at, um, interaction with people, that's good.
100;high;109;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;110;therapist;You know, um, i've been clean from that sort of lifestyle for that long so that's-that's-that's up for me, you know, that's-that's good. um—
100;high;111;client;And you can- you can prove that and document that.
100;high;112;therapist;Yeah.
100;high;113;client;Yeah. a lot of folks can't.
100;high;114;therapist;They don't.
100;high;115;client;Yeah. and you've been going to school. i mean, all-all your movement is in this really positive, highly motivated way. and, um- and i think your-your thoughts and ideas about the fact that one day a conversation will- you'll strike up with somebody and it will happen to be with somebody who works for a company that perhaps does not have a policy against hiring people with felony convictions.
100;high;116;therapist;Yeah. well, that's my hope.
100;high;117;client;It's individual. yeah.
100;high;118;therapist;Yeah. that's my hope.
100;high;119;client;It-it is individual.
100;high;120;therapist;It is. it should be. you know, i-i—
100;high;121;client;It-- i believe it is.
100;high;122;therapist;Yeah.
100;high;123;client;There's no-- i don't think, any state or federal law that says.
100;high;124;therapist;No, no. it is an individual but you're right. yeah. it's—
100;high;125;client;Okay.
100;high;126;therapist;But here's the thing is—
100;high;127;client;Right person, right company-
100;high;128;therapist;Right.
100;high;129;client;-we're looking for here. yeah.
100;high;130;therapist;The thing is after, you know, after the 9/11 attacks, a lot of companies have blindly implemented, you know, those types of situa- and-and there's no- there isn't, at this point-- i mean, i don't think, at this point, there is no real sure fire way to find out what those reports are, you know, accurate or not. i mean, there's a lot of situations where people's reports are not even accurate about their criminal background.
100;high;131;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;132;therapist;I think that-
100;high;133;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;134;therapist;-blindly, people have implemented those types of, um, measures and they don't have any efficiency with them because they don't- you know, i mean, everybody is offering background checks now and stuff like that. and i'm- that's one of the things that i'm a
100;high;135;client;I wonder what it'd be like if you ran your own background check and got the report to see what's in there.
100;high;136;therapist;I have.
100;high;137;client;Oh, you do?
100;high;138;therapist;Yeah, i do. i have one and, uh, um.
100;high;139;client;Good for you doing that.
100;high;140;therapist;Right, yeah.
100;high;141;client;Yeah. smart.
100;high;142;therapist;Yeah. thank you. i don't know. i'm just, i guess-
100;high;143;client;Discouraged.
100;high;144;therapist;-what i'm really—
100;high;145;client;Discouraged, yeah.
100;high;146;therapist;Yeah, i'm really here because i think i'm- i-i- it's a very dangerous area for me when i'm discouraged because-
100;high;147;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;148;therapist;-you know, all the- despite all the good things that i have going for me, the only thing that's loud and clear are the things that i don't have going for me.
100;high;149;client;Mm-hmm.
100;high;150;therapist;If that makes any sense.
100;high;151;client;Uh, yeah, it does. uh, i am yet to- it-it seems to me just in this time we've been talking together that you, um, um, do have a sense that a lot of it has to do-do with, uh, timing, luck, who you know, and being, are you able to have that conversation where you know that you can sell yourself and your skills and, um, and your competencies and the fact that you've overcome so many things like, um, substance abuse problem and, uh, have been, you know, uh, a good upstanding citizen all this time. um, to me, if i were an employer, you know, i would- i would be impressed with that.
100;high;152;therapist;Thank you.
100;high;153;client;Uh-- you're welcome. and- so what about, um, i know i had a client that told me a couple of things. he was doing some work on this, uh, if you- if you'd be interested i could tell you what he shared with me.
100;high;154;therapist;Yeah, yeah, i am.
100;high;155;client;Okay. um, he found the most valid information on blogs done by felons.
100;high;156;therapist;Oh, okay.
100;high;157;client;They are your experts.
100;high;158;therapist;Very interesting.
100;high;159;client;And, uh, they-they are actually, uh, uh, much what you have said, they said, but they also, uh, uh, talked about which places and companies they did find were open. for instance, family-owned businesses just tend to-- they can, if they can--
100;high;160;therapist;Yeah, again, it's like who you know, right?
100;high;161;client;Right, right.
100;high;162;therapist;I know that-
100;high;163;client;Or start your own business. that was another thing that i thought was really--
100;high;164;therapist;Yeah, well, i think that's what i got. that's what i am doing. that's what i'm sort of involved with now is like, you know, find, um, you know, i'm still continuing to go to school, but i'm also starting, um, work for myself. um, you know, it's not no fortune 500 company or anything, but i do have a little bit of income coming in from that.
100;high;165;client;Uh-huh.
100;high;166;therapist;Um, it-it, uh, you know, it will all come together.
100;high;167;client;So being an entre- being an entrepreneur fits for you.
100;high;168;therapist;You know what? actually, one of the things is that i read is that is that's one of the things you gotta do is just, uh, start your own business. you know what i mean? uh, you don't have to report to anybody. i mean, obviously, i can't work with, um-- unless i get a waiver i can't work with, like, i think the law says i can't work with kids or, um, like a hazmat stuff.
102;low;0;therapist;Hi, liz. well, thanks for meeting with me today.
102;low;1;client;Sure.
102;low;2;therapist;So what's something that you'd like to change or, um, work towards?
102;low;3;client;Well, [sighs] i've been thinking about working out lately. i really want to start working out again. it's-it's been in my mind, i know i need to do it. it's just getting the motivation to do it.
102;low;4;therapist;And you've been talking about that a lot lately. so i really-
102;low;5;client;Mm-hmm.
102;low;6;therapist;-feel like this is something that you need to do soon because, um, a lot of times, you're just a lot of talk. and then, there's no action. and if you really wanna see results, i think it's something that needs to be done. and, you know, stop being lazy ab
102;low;7;client;Well, i don't know if i'm really being lazy about it. i think it's just that i have a busy schedule.
102;low;8;therapist;Yeah.
102;low;9;client;I just need to find the time to do it. and, yes, i might be lacking a little bit of motivation, but i think it's more timing and trying to fit it in.
102;low;10;therapist;And that sounds like a lot of excuses to me. so i feel like you had shared with me before that you do have a gym membership. so i think that's something that you just need to fit in your schedule. so for you to really see results that you want, my guess is you need to go about three to four times a week and really fit in that hour workout, um, on a daily basis.
104;high;0;therapist;Before you go, do you mind if i take a look at the questionnaire you filled out before the visit?
104;high;1;client;Okay.
104;high;2;therapist;Thanks. i want you to know that whenever patients and i talk about alcohol and drugs, my role is to share information and learn from what they want to do, if anything. does that make sense?
104;high;3;client;Yeah.
104;high;4;therapist;Great. so, you wrote here that you've used alcohol in the last year on at least eight days?
104;high;5;client;Yeah. somewhere around eight days. i'm not sure.
104;high;6;therapist;Okay. how would you describe your drinking?
104;high;7;client;Um, i really only drink at parties. i don't drink at home or anything.
104;high;8;therapist;Okay. what kind of alcohol do you drink at parties?
104;high;9;client;Um, liquor, whenever people are mixing, um, vodka, sometimes beer, but i don't like beer very much. um, the drinks at parties are usually like vodka and orange juice or gin and tonics.
104;high;10;therapist;How much do you think you usually drink at a party?
104;high;11;client;You mean the whole time i'm there?
104;high;12;therapist;Yes.
104;high;13;client;Um, probably four or five drinks.
104;high;14;therapist;Speaker 1: okay. you checked the box here that drinking helps you feel relaxed, feel better about yourself or fit in?
104;high;15;client;Yeah. it makes me feel relaxed.
104;high;16;therapist;And you also checked that sometimes you forget things when you drink.
104;high;17;client;Yeah.
104;high;18;therapist;What kind of things do you forget?
104;high;19;client;Um, i forget how many drinks i've had like when a friend asks me or i forget whose house i'm at.
104;high;20;therapist;Sometimes you forget where you're at.
104;high;21;client;Right.
104;high;22;therapist;Here's the part where i share information. the safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks. that's because we know a number of negative things are more likely to happen when adolescents drink. we know alcohol can harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by accident. sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. i'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do what the possibility of having an std?
104;high;23;client;Um, yeah. i was drinking the last time i had sex. um, the guy had been drinking too, and we didn't use a condom.
104;high;24;therapist;Do you remember giving consent when you had sex?
104;high;25;client;Yeah. we've had sex before and we've used a condom before.
104;high;26;therapist;How do you think drinking alcohol affected using a condom this time?
104;high;27;client;Well, we just didn't stop to put one on. we weren't thinking that way.
104;high;28;therapist;Sounds like drinking changes how you think in those moments?
104;high;29;client;Yeah. i would've definitely told him to put on a condom if i was sober.
104;high;30;therapist;There's something else i wanna share. when people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. and when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder.
104;high;31;client;Well, that's not me. i don't need help from anyone.
104;high;32;therapist;I'm curious. what do you like about drinking alcohol?
105;high;0;therapist;. so, um, tell me about the exercise.
105;high;1;client;Well, um, since we spoke last, i've been to the gym a couple of times.
105;high;2;therapist;You have?
105;high;3;client;I have.
105;high;4;therapist;That's fantastic.
105;high;5;client;Yeah, and actually, my pants feel a little better too. i'm very pleased with it.
105;high;6;therapist;So, what else have you noticed other than your-your pants are fitting better?
105;high;7;client;Um, i do feel better.
105;high;8;therapist;Mm-hmm.
105;high;9;client;My back—
105;high;10;therapist;Your-- my what?
105;high;11;client;Well, my back doesn't hurt nearly so much.
105;high;12;therapist;Wow.
105;high;13;client;And, um, but it seems like it's, um-- but it's still hard. i'd like to go more often or i-i guess that i'm-- i just need to be a little more patient with myself because it's, um, i'm not, uh, i'm not-- i wanna be able to like spend more time at the gym but right now, it's um, not, um-- well, i guess i need to build up to it.
105;high;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. so and what would you-- what would- what would help you get to building up to it? spending more time there.
105;high;15;client;Um, well, i guess just sticking with it and not getting, um, sidetracked.
105;high;16;therapist;Mm-hmm.
105;high;17;client;Like last week, i-i didn't get there at all until like thursday during the week,-
105;high;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.
105;high;19;client;So it was- it was a frustrating week like for the gym that way.
105;high;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.
105;high;21;client;I was kinda busy with some other things, but, um—
105;high;22;therapist;Mm-hmm. but you made it-- you made it one day-
105;high;23;client;I-i got—
105;high;24;therapist;Instead of zero days.
105;high;25;client;Yeah, and actually, i made it again on saturday too. so.
105;high;26;therapist;That's fantastic.
105;high;27;client;Yeah.
105;high;28;therapist;Even with this, you know, pretty horrendous schedule going on.
105;high;29;client;Yeah. it's been a little-little hectic, you know. and, uh-- but, i-i don't like it too much because there's all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they can stay on the treadmill longer and it-it-it's a little discouraging, you know. 'cause i don't know if you've noticed, i'm not buff and they are. and it's-it's a little discouraging to think how much work it's gonna take to get, you know, kinda back towards that.
106;low;0;therapist;Okay, so i wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but in looking through the chart, i mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so.
106;low;1;client;Yeah.
106;low;2;therapist;That's really a big problem.
106;low;3;client;Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us. he gets really upset.
106;low;4;therapist;Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. are you smoking?
106;low;5;client;Yeah, i-- yeah, i do smoke, but i don't smoke around him. i try really hard not to smoke around him.
106;low;6;therapist;Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and so, what can you tell me about that?
106;low;7;client;I-i don't know. i mean, i try really hard not to smoke around him. i don't smoke in the car. um, when he's home, i go outside to smoke. i just-- i mean, i know it's bad, and i know it's bad for him, so i don't want him to be around it so i try really hard.
106;low;8;therapist;I really need you to quit smoking. both for your health and for aiden. did you know s-smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. also, things like vitamin c deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. it's really putting him at a lot of risk. in addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?
106;low;9;client;No, but i don't smoke. i'm-- i-i-i've thought about quitting, but it's just- it's really hard so i just don't know how to do it.
106;low;10;therapist;Well, now's the time to quit. it's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. not only for him, like i said, but also for you. you're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things-
106;low;11;client;I know, i know. i've heard-- people have told me before, i've heard all that. i just don't know how to do it. how am i supposed to quit? it's-it's so hard.
106;low;12;therapist;Well, there's all kinds of things you can use now. it's not as hard as it used to be. you can use nicotine replacement. there's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray. we can talk about medications. you can try chantix, you can try zyban, there's quit smoking groups you can go to, there's hotlines you can call.
108;high;0;therapist;Well, i want to thank you for coming in today to see me. um, i do understand from talking with your counselor that you've got quite a bit on your plate, you've got a lot going on. can you tell me a little bit about that?
108;high;1;client;Well, um, i have a two-year-old son, and then i work full time as a server at a restaurant, and then recently, i also started going back to night class, so you know, just the combination of all that, you know. i-i've just been feeling really stressed lately.
108;high;2;therapist;Yeah, i could see that. um, may i ask, are you also a single mom?
108;high;3;client;Yeah.
108;high;4;therapist;So you've got a lot of stressors right now. you're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. what do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?
108;high;5;client;Well, i-i told the counselor that i think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now.
108;high;6;therapist;Okay. can you tell me a little bit about that?
108;high;7;client;Yeah. um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. you know, she like will back out at the last second, and so i've had to call in at work a couple of times. i've had to miss class a few times. so i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether i'll be able to do those things or not.
108;high;8;therapist;Okay. so i'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. you actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic.
108;high;9;client;Yeah, exactly.
108;high;10;therapist;Okay. um, outside your mom, is there anyone else that can help with childcare?
108;high;11;client;Um, well, i have a sister, but i don't really trust her to watch my son, and i don't really know that many people that-- the only thing i can think of, i have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. she-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out.
108;high;12;therapist;Okay.
108;high;13;client;Um, i don't really know her that well, but i mean, she seems nice and i-i think she did a pretty good job that night.
108;high;14;therapist;Hmm. so what i hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be.
108;high;15;client;Yeah.
108;high;16;therapist;Stepped in last minute. um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy?
108;high;17;client;Yeah.
108;high;18;therapist;Okay. let's pursue that neighbor a little bit. um, people like that, i like to think of as natural resources, but i know for a lot of people, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability.
108;high;19;client;Yeah.
108;high;20;therapist;Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?
108;high;21;client;I-- you know, i mean, maybe a little bit, but i don't really make that much money to be able to afford something like daycare or, you know, like full time babysitting.
108;high;22;therapist;Yeah, i can understand that. um, what are some of your natural skills?
108;high;23;client;Well, i mean, i-i like cooking. i'm-i'm actually in school for culinary arts.
108;high;24;therapist;Oh, i bet you're a really good cook then. um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare dinner for her and her, um, daughter?
108;high;25;client;Mm-hmm.
108;high;26;therapist;Um, you know, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. what do you think of a idea like that?
108;high;27;client;Hmm. that's, that's interesting. i-i never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work.
108;high;28;therapist;Okay. okay, i'm glad you think so. um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?
108;high;29;client;Hmm. no, i-- you know, there-there just aren't that many people i trust right now with my son.
108;high;30;therapist;Okay, i can respect that. you-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help?
108;high;31;client;[chuckles] no, no, not at all. he, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born.
108;high;32;therapist;Okay, fine. you know what? we've got one really good lead with the neighbor. i think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. um, how many days a week are you in school?
108;high;33;client;It's-it's three nights right now, so i have class on monday, wednesday, and friday nights.
109;high;0;therapist;Okay, hard part's over. so the good news is no cavities.
109;high;1;client;Oh, great.
109;high;2;therapist;Yes, always happy to hear that. i do have some concerns though because i'm seeing some irritation in your mouth in the palate that's called nicotinic stomatitis and-
109;high;3;client;That sounds bad.
109;high;4;therapist;Yeah, it is. it's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so i'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit how-- about how tobacco fits in your life right now.
109;high;5;client;Tobacco. well, i don't smoke cigarettes. i've never smoked cigarettes. i do go out with my friends. um, you know, we go out to bars and, you know, we'll have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigarillo-type things. i mean i wouldn't even think of them as cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes. um, and i mean i'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my friends but certainly not 20 or 30 of them a day like you would with cigarettes and that's the only thing that could possibly have anything to do with tobacco.
109;high;6;therapist;So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. it sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. but you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out.
109;high;7;client;But that's- that's just like a- a social thing. that's something that my friends and i do. we-- we-- it's not habit or something that i have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. not packs of them.
109;high;8;therapist;Yeah, so you're not-- you're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day.
109;high;9;client;Oh, no. no.
109;high;10;therapist;The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth.
109;high;11;client;Well, we've-- you have a point there. mm, now that you mention it, um, i have started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since i have a couple of friends at work that smoke and so every time we have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, and so i- now i go with them and i have one of these swisher sweets. um, i like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they're so cute. but that's really only pretty recently.
109;high;12;therapist;Uh-huh. so smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. when you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking.
109;high;13;client;Well, yeah, yeah. you know now that you say it like that it's true. um, i am smoking on a daily basis.
109;high;14;therapist;So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it?
109;high;15;client;Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, um. um, and you know, when, you know, i like to go to las vegas, and so when we go to vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thing.
109;high;16;therapist;Okay.
109;high;17;client;I wouldn't say i was a chain smoker.
109;high;18;therapist;Okay. how about the other side? have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?
109;high;19;client;Well, i was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because i've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so i imagine that has something to do with the smoking.
109;high;20;therapist;Yeah. so we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. are there any other things that you're concerned about?
109;high;21;client;Um. well, there's the expense, you know. wi-with the economy and all, um, i- i have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if i'm buying more of them than i used to. so the-the money aspect is also a concern.
109;high;22;therapist;Mm-hmm. so there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you.
109;high;23;client;Oh, yeah.
109;high;24;therapist;Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the swisher sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?
109;high;25;client;Oh, absolutely not. i mean i thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful.
109;high;26;therapist;Mm-hmm. so it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you.
111;high;0;therapist;Hi, are you katie?
111;high;1;client;Yeah.
111;high;2;therapist;Hi, my name is beth. i'm the nurse that works with the nurse practitioner mrs. smith that you just saw. do you have a moment to talk?
111;high;3;client;Uh, sure. what's this about?
111;high;4;therapist;I know you were here to get a prescription for birth control but while you were waiting to see mrs. smith, you filled out a healthy habits questionnaire-
111;high;5;client;Mm-hmm.
111;high;6;therapist;And you answered some questions about your marijuana use. would it be okay if i asked you some questions about how marijuana plays a role in your life?
111;high;7;client;Sure.
111;high;8;therapist;I notice you use marijuana regularly, and i wanted to ask you more about that.
111;high;9;client;Well, you know they just decriminalized it in virginia, it's not a big deal. i'm not in trouble, am i?
111;high;10;therapist;No. no, no, no. not at all. um, i just wanted to ask you how it helps you and how you use it. can you tell me a little more about how you use it?
111;high;11;client;It's not a big deal. it's just like a couple times a week to relax.
111;high;12;therapist;Marijuana is really useful in your life in helping you relax?
111;high;13;client;Yeah. i mean, i'm here on an academic scholarship so i have to keep my grades up and i'm on the debate team, so there's a lot going on.
111;high;14;therapist;Mm. you're a very successful student and you have a lot of responsibilities, and it's really adding to your stress.
111;high;15;client;Well, yeah. the truth is i'm the first in my family to go to college so i don't know, i guess, i'm in a bit over my head.
111;high;16;therapist;Mm. you've been very successful academically and the transition to college has been hard for you.
111;high;17;client;I've always been an anxious person. pot just helps me calm my nerves. i'm i in trouble?
111;high;18;therapist;I promise you, you're not in trouble, i wanna help.
111;high;19;client;Uh, tell me besides helping you relax, what are some positives about pot?
111;high;20;therapist;Well, some of these kids are just so much more sophisticated than me so i guess when i party with them, i feel like i'm fitting in. i don't know how else to explain it.
111;high;21;client;Hmm. uh, when you use pot in a group you feel more at home with your peers and more accepted?
111;high;22;therapist;I don't know if i feel more accepted, more like i'm trying to fit in by using it.
111;high;23;client;So how is it working to help you fit in?
111;high;24;therapist;I'm not sure it is.
111;high;25;client;Mm. so smoking pot with your peers to try to fit in more but it doesn't seem to be making you feel more comfortable with your friends.
111;high;26;therapist;Uh, yeah.
111;high;27;client;What are some downsides to smoking pot?
111;high;28;therapist;I don't know. i- it helps me relax but i guess i'm nervous i'll get caught. um, my parents would kill me if they knew that i smoked.
111;high;29;client;So smoking pot doesn't help you feel more socially comfortable with your peers and it increases your stress because you're worried about your family and legal consequences?
111;high;30;therapist;Yeah.
111;high;31;client;Can you think of any other downsides to smoking pot?
111;high;32;therapist;Well, i don't have the money for it. i just usually bum it off to my roommate, her parents give her a lot of spending money but i don't know, it's kind of embarrassing to have to do that.
111;high;33;client;So smoking pot also reminds you of your financial situation and you don't have extra cash to spend on things?
111;high;34;therapist;Yeah.
112;high;0;therapist;So, chris, i wanted to talk to you. um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. i really value you as a team player. as athletic director, one of my jobs is to, kind of, keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best. and something came up this weekend. i've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. and so i wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.
112;high;1;client;Okay, oh, actually, could i confide something in you that has been bothering me lately. well, prior to that party, like, as you know, i'm a honor student and my parents, like, they keep me very, like k-kept down out of the, like so- like social life.
112;high;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.
112;high;3;client;And, um, about a month ago, my friends invited me to a party. and they used the fact that, oh, i'm always doing my homework, i'm always studying that to allow me to go to the party. and on-- well, that party, i managed to convince my parents that i would spend the night at my friend's house. so, that's when i started drinking.
112;high;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.
112;high;5;client;"It was a- it was a unique experience, as you can say. i guess you can say. and, i don't know, i-- it was fun, at least, in the moment. so, i kept doing it. then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, i asked my-- i begged my mom to let me go to another party. and she, kind of, knew what i was doing. she asked me to, like, to promise her of no alcohol, no drugs. then i'll pick you up by 12:00. and i-i was surprised. 12:00-12:00, that's basically when the party starts, but i told her whatever-- i thought- i thought to myself that i'll-i'll come-- i'll figure out to delay her, can you pick me up later? so later, so she-- i promised that-- she dropped me off, i promised her no alcohol, no nothing. so i-- we go, i have fun like i've been having. and i was drinking. and then the time- the time came for her to pick me up. and as soon-- i couldn't delay her from picking me up. and as soon as she picked me up, and i stepped in the car, she said, ""you drank vodka."" and i'm like, i-i didn't know what to say. i just looked at the floor. and i-i feel terrible because i-i betrayed my mother. i broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. and that's exactly what i did."
112;high;6;therapist;So, here you are. you're an honors student. you're a star athlete. you've, kind of, been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the party scene.
112;high;7;client;Right.
112;high;8;therapist;And it was fun at first. but now you're already noticing some consequences.
112;high;9;client;Yes, right. like i've been noticing i've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.
112;high;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.
112;high;11;client;I haven't really-- i kind of just sit in class like-- i-- my mind is elsewhere, especially on the weekends, where instead of-- i was- i was instead of studying, i caught up with my friends, trying to find where we can-- i get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that.
112;high;12;therapist;It's really changed your focus. what do you like about drinking?
112;high;13;client;I don't know. it-it's because i'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when- not when i'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like a social environment. i tend to keep to myself because i'm very self-conscious, i would say. and when i- when i drink, i feel, i don't know, like, it relaxes me. i'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. i don't know it just—
112;high;14;therapist;So, it helps you, kind of, loosen up, feel more relaxed.
112;high;15;client;Exactly.
112;high;16;therapist;Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though your mom got mad at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well in school, maybe-
112;high;17;client;Kind of.
112;high;18;therapist;Or any other things?
112;high;19;client;Just different groups, friends or groups, girlfriends, like different people that i'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of scene.
112;high;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.
112;high;21;client;So, that-that-that's also changed.
112;high;22;therapist;So, your-your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now.
112;high;23;client;A little bit because not all of them are into that. so, like, i'm in one group of friends, and i would talk to another person that's an another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.
112;high;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.
112;high;25;client;So, since then, i've been hanging out more with them, getting to know them. but i can also see that oh, i'm just living life, i guess. but that's also not fair to them that i'm not there for them as much as i was before.
112;high;26;therapist;Okay.
112;high;27;client;As they are there for me, you know.
112;high;28;therapist;Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it's affecting your relationship with your mom. where do you think you should kind of go from here?
112;high;29;client;Oh, um, i feel i should st-stop. i mean, like, i'm not-not unrealistic. i understand that situations like this will happen.
112;high;30;therapist;Mm-hmm.
112;high;31;client;It's just up to me not to take it so far, where i can't remember the night before, if i'm puking. all i remember is the toilet-
112;high;32;therapist;Mm-hmm.
112;high;33;client;-that's-that's not worth it, either. and i have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow. it's little so i guess may seem to other people.
112;high;34;therapist;Yeah.
112;high;35;client;But to me then it's a big thing.
112;high;36;therapist;Your mom is really important to you.
112;high;37;client;Of course.
112;high;38;therapist;And how she feels about you is important to you.
113;high;0;therapist;Hi, sandra.
113;high;1;client;Hi.
113;high;2;therapist;Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. i understand you don't have very much time, but i really appreciate you stopping by.
113;high;3;client;Well, i came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well. i think it's important to quit, but i enjoy smoking. i'm not ready to give it up right now. my life is too much in turmoil.
113;high;4;therapist;So i get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? what-what were some of the things you were thinking about?
113;high;5;client;I think it's important because i've-- i feel i'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking, so i don't want her to think it's a good thing.
113;high;6;therapist;So the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking.
113;high;7;client;I smoked when i was young, and i certainly don't want it for her.
113;high;8;therapist;Hmm. and it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately.
113;high;9;client;Well, that's true. it seems so hard. i'm just not ready for this right now.
113;high;10;therapist;So sandra, what's good about smoking? what do you like about it?
113;high;11;client;It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. when i'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and, you know, talk about things. i would hate to not smoke, really. i'd be left out.
113;high;12;therapist;What else? tell me what else is good about it.
113;high;13;client;Hmm, i like to have a cigarette after i eat. it sort of tells my brain i'm finished, stop eating, i'm full. so it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes i'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight.
113;high;14;therapist;Okay. so is there anything else that you like about it?
113;high;15;client;Let me think. well, i just enjoy it. i think it's, uh-- it's not good for me, i know, but i'm so used to smoking. i don't really think about quitting too much.
113;high;16;therapist;So let me make sure that i understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if i've missed anything or left anything out.
113;high;17;client;Okay.
113;high;18;therapist;So it sounds like it's a way to relax. it's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke.
113;high;19;client;That's true. yeah.
113;high;20;therapist;You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up.
113;high;21;client;Yeah.
113;high;22;therapist;I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. it's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?
113;high;23;client;Exactly.
113;high;24;therapist;So i'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. what about the other side? can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things?
113;high;25;client;Well, i-i'm worried about my children. i feel like i'm being a bad parent, and um, i often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years. i certainly don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking.
113;high;26;therapist;Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her?
113;high;27;client;Yeah, just this morning, i was outside having a cigarette, and then when i looked up, there she was looking out the window watching me smoke.
113;high;28;therapist;So this morning, that experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. how did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you?
113;high;29;client;I felt terrible, you know, i was projecting-- i wanna be a good parent, and i don't feel this really is part of the plan.
114;high;0;therapist;In summary, the minnesota state mankato security report states that you were stopped on stadium road last friday, cited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox. plus the report lists your age as 20. dylan, what is the accuracy of the report? and can you share with me some details leading up to the incident?
114;high;1;client;Uh, i guess that sound- that sounds right. i mean, i was- i was kinda drunk and it happened like a week ago. i just, i drove over to my friend's house, um, just to go watch the game and, you know, we're having a couple beers and next thing i know the vikings are kind of losing pretty big. so we drank a little bit more than usual. and i mean, at the end i had to get home and i couldn't find a ride. so i-i just drove.
114;high;2;therapist;You decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the vikings were playing. and when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home, you decided to drive yourself home. did i get that right?
114;high;3;client;Yeah. that's-that's exactly how it happened. i mean, i'm a normal college kid. i like to drink and hanging out with my buddies. i mean, i, it wasn't a big house party or anything and i got busted.
114;high;4;therapist;Yeah, i understand that your intention was to have a good time while watching the game with your friends. you didn't think about what could go wrong when you drank alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house and not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home.
114;high;5;client;Yeah. i tried to be safe. i mean, i tried to call her roommate, but i don't know, getting in trouble anyways.
114;high;6;therapist;Dylan, you told me what brought you here today, what do you think the problem really is?
114;high;7;client;Um, well, i wanna say i have a drinking problem. i think i'd probably have more of a, like getting caught problem. i mean, my friends, they-they drink like fishes and i-- they don't ever get caught and you got me over here and i get caught and they left.
114;high;8;therapist;Sounds like you attribute your current situation to bad luck. if that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior, what consequences might result?
114;high;9;client;I guess- i guess more problems with police and school and i really don't have like the time or the money for any of that.
114;high;10;therapist;How important is it that you avoid future problems with the police or school, dylan?
114;high;11;client;God. it's, i guess, super important, because just-just going to detox alone was-was awful, the experience-- i don't want to do that again. and my dad said if i get suspended from school, um, i have to go- i have to go work on my uncle's farm in iowa and that would just kill my social life. i won't see any of my friends and i mean, it's already bad enough, like my parents took my car away when i got the dui.
114;high;12;therapist;Yeah. what would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended?
114;high;13;client;Well, i guess i- i guess the easy one is i wouldn't- i wouldn't drink so much and i try to avoid situations where i'm more-more likely to get in trouble. so probably i don't wanna drink so much.
115;low;0;therapist;Okay, so why don't you have a rinse, david. how are you feeling?
115;low;1;client;Okay.
115;low;2;therapist;Good. here, take a look, see what you think. and that feeling-
115;low;3;client;Yeah.
115;low;4;therapist;-and the color's okay? you know, there is quite a lot of staining so, um, i'm just wondering about, um, some concerns about smoking.
115;low;5;client;Oh.
115;low;6;therapist;Possibly-
115;low;7;client;Gonna get that again.
115;low;8;therapist;-coffee, tea. yeah, you've heard this before, i'm sure.
115;low;9;client;I do all the above, yeah.
115;low;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. so, you know, the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences. you know, physically, it affects dental caries, dental cavities-
115;low;11;client;Yeah.
115;low;12;therapist;-um, healing-
115;low;13;client;Yeah.
115;low;14;therapist;In your mouth.
115;low;15;client;Okay. sure.
115;low;16;therapist;So--
115;low;17;client;I've heard it all. i-- but i just want to get my teeth fixed.
115;low;18;therapist;Yes, and i really want to be helpful. i really want to-- you know, my commitment is to your oral health, so um, there are lots of medications out there, david, that actually take away a lot of the cravings. they're-- they make quitting so much easier.
115;low;19;client;I did a pill thing, so i did try it. so like, i did try try it. i just did the pills and they didn't work.
115;low;20;therapist;Mm-hmm. yeah.
115;low;21;client;It was a waste and it caused more side effects
115;low;22;therapist;.no, it-- but david, it's not a waste. research shows that people take on average about seven tries before they quit smoking, so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting, so--
115;low;23;client;Or seven lectures along the road.
115;low;24;therapist;Well, i don't think i'm giving you a lecture, that's certainly not what i meant. i--
115;low;25;client;No. no, i just feel that way. i get really-- i get very defensive about when they bring-- cause i get it from my family doc, from my cardiologist, everybody. i'm like, i'm not a complete fool. i am for smoking, but—
115;low;26;therapist;Well, there's-there's a reason that [crosstalk] people are concerned.
115;low;27;client;-but it's not easy to quit.
116;high;0;therapist;Molly, thank you so much for coming over and yakking with me today.
116;high;1;client;You're welcome.
116;high;2;therapist;Yeah, i appreciate it. so, um, uh, your mom had given me a call and said that, um, um, there were some problems with kids kinda given you problems at school and being mean and things like that, and, uh, that's a hurtful thing.
116;high;3;client;Yeah. i stayed home two times already from school just 'cause of the bullying and everything.
116;high;4;therapist;That's a- that's a lot of school to, yeah, and, you know--
116;high;5;client;And as i was out of school like more rumors started to happen as i was out of school. i come back and like these rumors are going around about me. like one time when i stayed home, supposedly, i was in the principal's office the whole day and i had security guards like escort me to classes which that was not true 'cause i was home the whole time.
116;high;6;therapist;People like to make up stories.
116;high;7;client;I've been getting blamed ever since like fifth or sixth grade about with every single thing that's going on.
116;high;8;therapist;For, like why do you think, wh-what kinds of-
116;high;9;client;I think because the kids-- 'cause i like to nag on things. like when people tell me things, i like to like talk more like with the person instead of just leaving it be, and i think the kids that like blame me for everything say that i'm an easy target to like hit, to like talk about, it's like annoying.
116;high;10;therapist;So it's, uh, so when you were talking about like nagging on, tell me a little bit more about, can you give me an example of what you mean?
116;high;11;client;"If somebody says like, ""oh, i heard this thing about you."" i go, ""oh, really, what is it,"" and i just keep talking and like make things worse. like, if somebody says that they wanna beat me up, i like go on, and say like, ""okay, then hit me,"" and like i just don't leave it be, like i just don't walk away. i like stay there and like talk more."
116;high;12;therapist;And-and what happens when you don't leave it be, what usually happens?
116;high;13;client;"I think possibly more like talking more like it gets like bigger and bigger. it's just like if you stop it, then they don't know what to say, they-they're like, ""oh, like she's walking away."" and like that stops everything but like if i talk it-it keeps building up and we both get in trouble-"
116;high;14;therapist;Okay.
116;high;15;client;-and like called down to the principal's office.
116;high;16;therapist;Okay.
116;high;17;client;And get talked to.
116;high;18;therapist;Okay, so and then what-what's it like for you after that, once you get spanked in the principal's office?
116;high;19;client;Well, usually i try telling myself to just like, leave it be-
116;high;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.
116;high;21;client;-but if somebody says something about me, it gets me mad 'cause like what the heck, like you're talking about me so like i try to stop but sometimes i just say like a few words. like i think now i'm trying to get like better.
116;high;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.
116;high;23;client;"Like there's this one incident that somebody was talking to me, i just said like, ""oh, wow, this is like really lame, like i'm just gonna leave,"" and i like let the conversation be."
116;high;24;therapist;That's pretty cool that you did that.
116;high;25;client;Yeah. i felt proud of myself.
116;high;26;therapist;You should be proud of yourself, and how did you do that?
116;high;27;client;"I was just like thinking of like when i'm- whenever i like i'm saying like stuff back, mom gets really mad at me, she's like, ""well, i'm not gonna help you anymore."" 'cause, she tells me to like leave it be, but i really don't lis-listen to her so she gets mad. so i tried like thinking of like her feelings and like what would happen after if i say, ""this is lame, leave me alone,"" 'cause then they'll like stop and i won't get like yelled at anymore."
116;high;28;therapist;Uh, that says a lot about you and your mom's relationship though that you can kind of put yourself in her head and think about how she would feel about it.
116;high;29;client;Yeah.
116;high;30;therapist;You know what i mean? it's pretty cool, not everybody can do that, so. so you could kind of put yourself ahead, uh, it's almost like watching a movie ahead-
116;high;31;client;Yeah.
116;high;32;therapist;-and knowing how it's gonna turn out.
116;high;33;client;'cause usually, if i get in trouble, mom gives me the silent treatment that i don't like. it's like she doesn't talk to me, i'm like trying to talk to her, she don't like wheezing being like, uh, i don't like it.
116;high;34;therapist;That's the worst, the silent treatment.
116;high;35;client;Yeah.
116;high;36;therapist;Yeah, so, um, so but that worked for you, where you just let it go, you thought about your mom, you like what we would call like, you channeled to your mom, you know, and, uh, channeling mom, and then, um, you were able to walk away, and you were proud of yourself and nothing bad happened.
116;high;37;client;Yeah.
116;high;38;therapist;Is that right?
116;high;39;client;Yeah.
116;high;40;therapist;Does it--
116;high;41;client;Like they all like stopped talking to me, and the funny thing was that their eighth-graders that like didn't even go to my old school like i don't even know how they said of talking to me, i was like, creepy.
116;high;42;therapist;Yeah, so- and so when you- when somebody else told you that they or people said you that you're an easy target, um.
116;high;43;client;Well, they don't really say that to me like i just like think that 'cause that's what i've like heard from my mom, and people talking to me 'cause i keep talking to them-
116;high;44;therapist;Okay.
116;high;45;client;So they keep coming back at me.
116;high;46;therapist;Okay, so they-they kinda know how to hook you.
116;high;47;client;Mm-hmm.
116;high;48;therapist;-and reel you in-
116;high;49;client;Yeah.
116;high;50;therapist;-right, and get you upset. and then bad things happen and then you get in trouble.
116;high;51;client;Yeah. [chuckles] that happens a lot.
116;high;52;therapist;Yeah. so, yeah. and it's, uh-- so, um-- so you-you know that when you're kind of channeling your mom, that helps. it sounds like you taught yourself almost. like there's-
116;high;53;client;Yeah.
116;high;54;therapist;A conversation inside. what other ideas do you have about what you could do?
116;high;55;client;I was thinking of like, um, if i'm like at school like a peep things are happening during class-
116;high;56;therapist;Mm-hmm.
116;high;57;client;-i just say, can i use the washroom or something to go like walk and like think of like how to like leave them be. and one time during my gym class, there's this girl that i had her like not talking early. and we're playing pickleball, i don't know if you
116;high;58;therapist;I don't know what pickleball is.
116;high;59;client;-it's like a badminton, big life-size ping pong ball game.
116;high;60;therapist;It looks like a pickleball?
116;high;61;client;Yeah, you have like a big bracket—
116;high;62;therapist;There's no pickle?
116;high;63;client;No.
116;high;64;therapist;Okay.
116;high;65;client;No, [chuckles] there's no pick.
116;high;66;therapist;I wanted to pickle and stuff.
116;high;67;client;Mm-hmm. and like i was supposed to be like again turn. i told my-- i went to my gym teacher like silently and said i can't be by this person, can i move to the next court. so he like switched us around so i won't be by her. and that like happened.
116;high;68;therapist;That's a really good decision.
116;high;69;client;The girls like what the heck like.
116;high;70;therapist;Yeah. no, but how smart on your part to know that if you would- if you would had to play with her, something bad would've happened.
116;high;71;client;Yeah. like i would like smacked her in the face or some- [laughs]
116;high;72;therapist;You knew that.
116;high;73;client;Or something.
116;high;74;therapist;Right? you knew that. so-
116;high;75;client;Yeah.
116;high;76;therapist;So you know actually which kids-
116;high;77;client;Yeah, that's like—
116;high;78;therapist;Know how to push your buttons that real you in.
116;high;79;client;Yeah, there's like four main ones but not that like i can say who.
116;high;80;therapist;That's okay. that's-- yeah, 'cause it's not important. the important thing is for you to be happy. and, uh--
116;high;81;client;And the friends that i have like i know are my true friends, they're like ones that don't really 'cause drama or like—
116;high;82;therapist;Uh-huh.
116;high;83;client;I mean, they might but like they're not like bad and they actually like help me. like some of these girls that like so-called friends like-
116;high;84;therapist;Uh-huh.
116;high;85;client;"-they're like they come to me saying like, ""oh, did you really have to like punch this girl."" i'm like, ""no."" it's like you're not a friend if you'd actually believe that, you know what i mean?"
116;high;86;therapist;Yeah.
116;high;87;client;Yeah, it's kind of annoying, 'cause it's kind of hard like going into high school and like knowing how to believe and who not to believe.
116;high;88;therapist;Yeah. that's-- that-- it's-it's really big unknown territory. pressure high school class is probably 1,000 kids.
116;high;89;client;Yeah, 1,003.
116;high;90;therapist;1,003 kids.
116;high;91;client;And then there's the sophomores also that you have like another 1,000, so it's like—
116;high;92;therapist;-2
116;high;93;client;Yeah.
116;high;94;therapist;-potential enemies, friends, who knows which ones.
116;high;95;client;Yeah, with these like the first rumors had started going around about like my friend and i, and like i lost him just 'cause of rumors. it's like, what the heck. like i couldn't get over him for like gosh, who knows, it was like three months and i finally just had got over him.
116;high;96;therapist;That must have been hard for you.
116;high;97;client;Yeah.
116;high;98;therapist;Yeah.
116;high;99;client;I was like really, you're probably just jealous 'cause i was friends with him or something.
117;high;0;therapist;Hello, nice to meet you again. and, uh, and what seems to be the-the problem or what-what prompted you to come along?
117;high;1;client;Uh, just i'm sick of my drinking. i'm drinking too much. um, i just thought, uh, maybe i need someone to talk to, get some help about it.
117;high;2;therapist;Okay, so you feel as if drinking is a problem for you at the moment?
117;high;3;client;Yeah, it's just- it's just got worse over the last six months?
117;high;4;therapist;Okay. wh-what makes you say that it's gotten worse?
117;high;5;client;Well, i guess, i drank, you know, like most people do before, um, but i broke up with my boyfriend, uh, about a year ago and then six months ago i guess i wanted to go out again and see if i can meet people.
117;high;6;therapist;Okay.
117;high;7;client;And i've been, yeah, getting into this habit of going out every friday and saturday, now, uh, drinking a lot.
117;high;8;therapist;Yes.
117;high;9;client;Um, to try to meet guys.
117;high;10;therapist;Sure.
117;high;11;client;And, uh, in the last few months i've been, you know, just drinking even more on week nights, and i never even used to do that before.
117;high;12;therapist;Okay, okay, so you've noticed over, i guess, uh, the last six months in particular since you decided, you know what? i'm going to take a risk and-a-and go out to try to meet a-a-a pot-potential partner again that it's with an increase in drinking.
117;high;13;client;Yeah. well, i just, i don't feel comfortable talking to guys normally. [chuckles]
117;high;14;therapist;Okay.
117;high;15;client;I don't know what to say, um, and i just, drinking helps.
117;high;16;therapist;Sure, sure. so you're noticing that the drinking at the moment is a way of perhaps calming the nerves?
117;high;17;client;Yeah, for sure.
117;high;18;therapist;To-to-to speak to-to potential partners?
117;high;19;client;Yeah, definitely.
117;high;20;therapist;Who-who-who, boys?
117;high;21;client;Yeah.
117;high;22;therapist;Okay.
117;high;23;client;I mean, i guess, like most people do when they go out they drink.
117;high;24;therapist;Okay.
117;high;25;client;I've been doing that and just drinking more and more i guess.
117;high;26;therapist;Sure.
117;high;27;client;Um, and it's just-- it's not even working, i'm not really meeting people and i just end up with massive hangover for the rest of the weekend and—
117;high;28;therapist;That's interesting isn't it? you-- 'cause you kind of mentioned it there, like, you know, on one side of the coin, um, it helps calm the nerves to get yourself get out there and-
117;high;29;client;Yeah.
117;high;30;therapist;-talk to guys at the same time, on the other side it's not working you're finding. and i-i-it results in hangovers or?
117;high;31;client;Yeah, i mean, i've maybe talked to people but it's just, uh, that i've just i think i'm just too-too drunk and i just, my friends drive me home and just the end of the night i don't-- yeah.
117;high;32;therapist;Okay, and so i guess, you know, what would you like to do given the circumstances?
117;high;33;client;I guess i just wanna stop. i just feel like i'm drinking more and more 'cause i'm doing it now in the weekdays-
117;high;34;therapist;Yeah.
117;high;35;client;-and i mean, i just don't-- i don't wanna do that every now and now i just think it's a bit too much.
117;high;36;therapist;Okay.
117;high;37;client;Yeah, i'm just i'm not eating properly anymore, i'm just eating less or just getting takeaway, getting crap food and-
117;high;38;therapist;Okay.
117;high;39;client;-um, i'm just, i feel like i'm not exerc-- well i'm not exercising like i used to. so, i just wanna cut, you know, stop drinking so much.
117;high;40;therapist;Okay, okay, so, uh, sounds like you really want to stop drinking, particularly during the weekdays?
117;high;41;client;Yeah. yeah i do. yeah.
117;high;42;therapist;Right, because you're noticing it's having a negative impact on what you're eating.
117;high;43;client;Yeah. i don't wanna- i don't wanna, i mean, i don't wanna stop altogether, so.
117;high;44;therapist;No, i get it. yeah. i mean, you know, it sounds like it's, it is helpful to a degree for you when you go out because it makes you feel a little bit more calm to talk to-to guys is that right?
117;high;45;client;Yeah and just and all my friends go out and drink. like i-
117;high;46;therapist;Yeah.
117;high;47;client;-i'd have no social life if i didn't.
117;high;48;therapist;Yeah.
117;high;49;client;"If i just said-said, ""no, i'm not drinking at all,"" and, you know, i don't feel like i'm an alcoholic-"
117;high;50;therapist;Sure.
117;high;51;client;-or i don't feel like i need to
117;high;52;therapist;"Yeah, yeah. so, you've got, you know, some benefits there then, you know. the social element, hanging with friends and-and going out together is something which is-is quite enjoyable. so, it's not a case of removing it completely but it’s a case of, ""okay, i’m noticing this is impacting on me more than what i’d like to."" yeah. yeah, okay."
117;high;53;client;Yeah, it just got a bit out of control.
117;high;54;therapist;Has there been times in the past where you’ve tried to cut back on drinking?
119;high;0;therapist;Thanks for coming in. tell me what's been happening since we last spoke.
119;high;1;client;Well, i, um, i did get an interview for a job. um—
119;high;2;therapist;Wow, that's so great.
119;high;3;client;Yeah, but i wasn't able to go, um, cause my kids, i didn't have any one to watch them. and, um, you know, so the- that was sort of game over. i just, i had to cancel the interview and this, it's too bad because it was a really, a- actually was a job that would have been good, but i don't know.
119;high;4;therapist;You sound disappointed.
119;high;5;client;Well, yeah, because it's- it's, you know, i didn't really have a choice. i guess i have to be- i have to make sure my kids are taken care of first. and, um, you know, i'm worried that this is gonna keep happening.
119;high;6;therapist;It's gonna keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities.
119;high;7;client;Yeah.
119;high;8;therapist;Mm-hmm, okay. well, tell me, um, on a scale from one to 10, how important is it for you to get a job?
119;high;9;client;Um, it sits about at a 10 because yeah, i mean, i'm the only one supporting my kids and, um, you know, it's just, what i'm getting from welfare is just not cutting it. so i really need to have a job and soon.
119;high;10;therapist;Yeah. you're-you're-you're it.
119;high;11;client;Yeah.
119;high;12;therapist;You have to provide for your children.
119;high;13;client;Mm-hmm.
119;high;14;therapist;Um, and tell me on a scale from one to 10, how confident are you that you could get a job?
119;high;15;client;I mean, right now, i think i'm about at a three. i just seems like, you know, even if i'm able to get into the interview and get childcare, you know, when i show up, i've got this resume that it's- it's not impressive and it's got all these gaps of employment and i'm not as educated as other people going in for the same job. so i just feel like i'm not, um, i don't know, that employable.
119;high;16;therapist;So, it sounds like, you know, the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and so finding something that would work for you would be really helpful.
119;high;17;client;Yeah.
119;high;18;therapist;And then also it sounds like you're kinda feeling not so great about your resume and your experience.
119;high;19;client;Yeah. yeah, because it's so limited and i've been out of the workforce and even when i was working, i mean, it's not, i don't know, it's not stuff that i feel like can lead to the job that i want now.
119;high;20;therapist;Okay. what is it that you- what is it that you want?
119;high;21;client;I just want something that is- is gonna be steady and where i can be, you know, even if my kids are in childcare during the day, that i can be home every night and spending time with them and, um, know you really like to get something where, um, i'm just making good money and- and i don't have to worry all the time about money.
119;high;22;therapist;Yeah. yeah. so, if you had- if you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways.
119;high;23;client;Yeah. it would be huge.
119;high;24;therapist;Mm-hmm. it would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much.
119;high;25;client;Yeah. and it'd be nice to just know what i'm doing and just have my routine.
119;high;26;therapist;Right. so every day you know where you're going.
119;high;27;client;Yeah.
119;high;28;therapist;Okay. and you know, what's- what's happening for the- for the day, for the week.
119;high;29;client;Right. well, it would be good if i knew, you know, that my kids are taken care of too-
119;high;30;therapist;Yeah.
119;high;31;client;- so i'm not worried about them while i'm at work.
119;high;32;therapist;Right. yeah. because you're- you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well.
119;high;33;client;Right.
119;high;34;therapist;Yeah. um, so tell me, what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence, to feel a little bit more confident about getting work?
119;high;35;client;Well, i mean, being able to make the interviews would be the priority.
119;high;36;therapist;Okay, yeah.
119;high;37;client;Um, so chi- you know, taking care, having some childcare, having-
119;high;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.
119;high;39;client;- having someone i trust that i can call when i know i've got an interview.
119;high;40;therapist;Yeah. because you definitely need to go to an interview in order to get the job.
119;high;41;client;Right. yeah.
119;high;42;therapist;So having taken care of that part, having some reliable childcare would definitely help.
119;high;43;client;Yeah.
119;high;44;therapist;What else would get you to a five?
119;high;45;client;Um, i just wish that i had- i had more experience or, um, you know, more education. it seems like everyone's got a college education and i don't have that on my resume.
119;high;46;therapist;Okay.
119;high;47;client;I get asked about education and training and –
119;high;48;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
119;high;49;client;- um, you know, i just, it, as soon as i asked about it, i just feel just like i'm not good enough-
119;high;50;therapist;Okay.
120;high;0;therapist;Well, i'm glad we figured that out and i think you'll feel better over the next few days.
120;high;1;client;Oh, thanks so much doctor. i'll just take it easy for a couple of days.
120;high;2;therapist;Well, since i have you here and we still have a few minutes left, i'd like to bring up another topic. i noticed that your blood pressure and your weight have been climbing a bit over the past few years. we haven't really had time to talk about this much before and i may be able to offer some useful strategies. would it be okay if we discussed weight and health for a few minutes?
120;high;3;client;Yeah, i suppose. i know my weight is a problem, but every time i try to take it off, i end up gaining it back. i don't know what to do.
120;high;4;therapist;I know how you feel. managing weight can be frustrating. maybe we can just start trying to figure it out together and i'll be here to help you through the challenges.
120;high;5;client;Okay, thank you doctor, but i'm just concerned about how i can possibly lose weight now since work is so busy and the kids take up so much of my time.
120;high;6;therapist;Yeah, that's certainly understandable. we both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now. maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready.
120;high;7;client;Okay, that sounds great. so, what should i do?
120;high;8;therapist;Well, let's see. one of the things that's involved in managing weight and health is being active. physical activity benefits the whole body. it's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. perhaps we could talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life.
120;high;9;client;I knew you were gonna say that, but i don't have time in my schedule. i can't afford to take an hour to go to the gym every day.
120;high;10;therapist;Well, i understand that. i don't have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of the great things about physical activity is that any amount in any type of activity can be very helpful. for example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing.
120;high;11;client;I like to walk.
120;high;12;therapist;Me too. walking is great exercise.
120;high;13;client;Wait a minute, isn't walking too mild to help you lose weight, though?
120;high;14;therapist;Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's great. walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym.
120;high;15;client;Oh, wow, that sounds good. you know what? come to think of it, i have some time before i have to go back to work and i saw a nice park on the way over here, maybe i can take a short walk after this appointment.
120;high;16;therapist;That sounds great.
120;high;17;client;And you know what? i used to really love to dance, but i haven't done that in such a long time.
121;high;0;therapist;Uh, welcome. and, uh—
121;high;1;client;Thank you.
121;high;2;therapist;I'd say my name is mark and i work here at green prescriptions. and-
121;high;3;client;Mm-hmm.
121;high;4;therapist;I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
121;high;5;client;From my gp?
121;high;6;therapist;From your gp, yeah.
121;high;7;client;Uh.
121;high;8;therapist;But before we get to anything, i'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
121;high;9;client;What's led me to come here?
121;high;10;therapist;Mm.
121;high;11;client;My gp.
121;high;12;therapist;And what did he have to say?
121;high;13;client;Well, um, you know, i had my sort of, uh, checkup.
121;high;14;therapist;Mm.
121;high;15;client;And it revealed that apparently, i might have diabetes 2. well, that's what he says.
121;high;16;therapist;Right.
121;high;17;client;Um, i-i think that i feel perfectly well. i-i'm, you know-- i understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than i am.
121;high;18;therapist;Mm.
121;high;19;client;But, um, that's really why i'm here. i'm on his command, almost.
121;high;20;therapist;Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
121;high;21;client;Well, he did. he says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
121;high;22;therapist;Mm.
121;high;23;client;But as i say, i-i feel absolutely fine now.
121;high;24;therapist;So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
121;high;25;client;Yeah.
121;high;26;therapist;"You go for this checkup with the doctor. and he says, ""you've got type ii diabetes."""
121;high;27;client;Mm, i'm very surprised.
121;high;28;therapist;Mm. came out of the blue for you?
121;high;29;client;Yes. i think it did.
121;high;30;therapist;Mm.
121;high;31;client;Mm.
121;high;32;therapist;And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda type ii diabetes look. that you kinda have had this idea-
121;high;33;client;I-
121;high;34;therapist;-you've been-been overweight with it.
121;high;35;client;That's what i understand.
121;high;36;therapist;Mm.
121;high;37;client;You know, and i'm not overweight.
121;high;38;therapist;Mm.
121;high;39;client;I-i sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. um, but i'm a busy person, i suppose i burn off the calories. and-
121;high;40;therapist;Mm.
121;high;41;client;I don't know, really.
121;high;42;therapist;Mm.
121;high;43;client;My lifestyle—
121;high;44;therapist;Hmm. so it doesn't quite fit in your head, type ii diabetes and-
121;high;45;client;No.
121;high;46;therapist;Your lifestyle?
121;high;47;client;No, not at all.
121;high;48;therapist;Comes as a big surprise. and what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
121;high;49;client;Well, i-i thought he must be joking. to be honest. i thought-
121;high;50;therapist;Mm.
121;high;51;client;-you know, why you are-- look around you.
121;high;52;therapist;Mm, mm.
121;high;53;client;Um, i just felt that, um-- i mean, i don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
121;high;54;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
121;high;55;client;Right?
121;high;56;therapist;He's got a lot to do.
121;high;57;client;Um-- absolutely right.
121;high;58;therapist;Mm.
121;high;59;client;He's got a job to do. and obviously, the tests have come through. and i have got these signs of diabetes 2.
121;high;60;therapist;Right.
121;high;61;client;Right? um, i just think that-- well, i just don't feel like it, mark.
121;high;62;therapist;Mm.
121;high;63;client;Um—
121;high;64;therapist;So how are you feel in your head-
121;high;65;client;I feel absolutely fine.
121;high;66;therapist;-and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
121;high;67;client;Yeah. well, physically, i feel absolutely fine.
121;high;68;therapist;Mm.
121;high;69;client;I'm-i'm-- i didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
121;high;70;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;71;client;I mean, i get around, i sleep pretty well-
121;high;72;therapist;Hmm-hmm.
121;high;73;client;I sort of you know-
121;high;74;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;75;client;- i'm-i'm compos mentis. so i don't—
121;high;76;therapist;Yeah. what's the problem? mm.
121;high;77;client;What is the problem?
121;high;78;therapist;And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. well, how did this--?
121;high;79;client;Well, uh, yes. i mean-
121;high;80;therapist;Mm.
121;high;81;client;-i must admit, i haven't done too much research. i've been a bit busy.
121;high;82;therapist;Okay.
121;high;83;client;Um, but he-he was saying something about, i don't know, family or whatever. i don't know.
121;high;84;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;85;client;And i don't know if it's hereditary.
121;high;86;therapist;Mm.
121;high;87;client;I think he said something about it being hereditary.
121;high;88;therapist;So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. and so you-
121;high;89;client;Yeah.
121;high;90;therapist;Maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
121;high;91;client;Yeah, it could be-
121;high;92;therapist;Mm.
121;high;93;client;-because, um, my mother mentioned-
121;high;94;therapist;Mm.
121;high;95;client;-that, uh, my father had diabetes-
121;high;96;therapist;Right.
121;high;97;client;-diabetes 2. and if i think about it, um, his brother-
121;high;98;therapist;Mm-hmm.
121;high;99;client;-uh, i haven't seen him for years.
121;high;100;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;101;client;But he might well have it because he is-
121;high;102;therapist;Mm.
121;high;103;client;-a pretty cuddly guy. you know-
121;high;104;therapist;Right.
121;high;105;client;He's pretty big.
121;high;106;therapist;So he fits the picture-
121;high;107;client;Well, yes, the stereotype,-
121;high;108;therapist;-when you think about what he-he-- yeah, he's stereotypical.
121;high;109;client;Yeah, i guess.
121;high;110;therapist;A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
121;high;111;client;Well, yeah. i mean, as far as i know, i hadn't seen him for-
121;high;112;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;113;client;-i don't know how many years.
121;high;114;therapist;Mm. so you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
121;high;115;client;Apparently so. yes, apparently so.
121;high;116;therapist;Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
121;high;117;client;Mm, i mean, it is hereditary, is it?
121;high;118;therapist;That's certainly true. yes. we know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
121;high;119;client;A genetic factor. and so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
121;high;120;therapist;Mm.
121;high;121;client;-if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
121;high;122;therapist;Correct. yeah.
121;high;123;client;Also, it's—
121;high;124;therapist;But it's not inevitable.
121;high;125;client;Right. okay.
121;high;126;therapist;Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. so there's other factors that come into play.
121;high;127;client;I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
121;high;128;therapist;Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. you mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. and what else do you know or have you heard? you say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. what else? other things you've.
121;high;129;client;To be frank, mark, i honestly don't know. i mean, i honestly don't know what causes it because i've never had any reason. it came upon me from the gp and it took me back.
121;high;130;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;131;client;Um, the hereditary thing i thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
121;high;132;therapist;That makes a bit of sense.
121;high;133;client;And why go any further, it's there?
121;high;134;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;135;client;Can't help it.
121;high;136;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;137;client;They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
121;high;138;therapist;They managed with it.
121;high;139;client;Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
121;high;140;therapist;Okay. i don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time type ii diabetes.
121;high;141;client;Well.
121;high;142;therapist;If that would help.
121;high;143;client;If there's something that you think that-- yes. yes, of course.
121;high;144;therapist;Well, i'll perhaps share with you what i know from working with other people and some of the things i've experienced in working with people.
121;high;145;client;Okay.
121;high;146;therapist;And see what you make of it. see if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. we know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. so also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. so-so it's a later onset. it takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. and the main reason i think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
121;high;147;client;I've heard of it yeah.
121;high;148;therapist;So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
121;high;149;client;Right.
121;high;150;therapist;All right. and type ii diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. they can't use insulin. and so sugar builds up in your system.
121;high;151;client;Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
121;high;152;therapist;You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
121;high;153;client;Oh, i see. so-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
121;high;154;therapist;That's right.
121;high;155;client;So insulin you-you.
121;high;156;therapist;Kind of, as your.
121;high;157;client;You have yourself draws bar.
121;high;158;therapist;Yap.
121;high;159;client;Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
121;high;160;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;161;client;Or-or digesting? should i say the excessive sugars?
121;high;162;therapist;That's a good way to think.
121;high;163;client;Is that what happened?
121;high;164;therapist;Exactly. and what's happening in type ii diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. it's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
121;high;165;client;Why?
121;high;166;therapist;And if-- well, there's a number of-- we're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. but what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
121;high;167;client;Right. okay.
121;high;168;therapist;Yeah. so there's a couple of things that we know that people with type ii diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with type ii diabetes. too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. and that can cause problems with your circulation. so too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. so sugar is the main concern in type ii- type ii diabetes.and you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- you've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
121;high;169;client;You mean, personally?
121;high;170;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;171;client;Well, i didn't know. i mean, the thing is you see that-- i mean, i did think about this a little bit and i thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
121;high;172;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;173;client;As you get older.
121;high;174;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;175;client;I mean, i don't-i don't leap over five bar gates like i used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, i tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
121;high;176;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;177;client;At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. and, um, the fish i'm hooking, i'm not after the kings anymore, i go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
121;high;178;therapist;A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
121;high;179;client;Yeah, absolutely. you just do.
121;high;180;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;181;client;You just do. um, so you're less demanding, i guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. you know, you let the youngsters get home.
121;high;182;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;183;client;"Been there, done that. so you don't really notice. so i'm coming back to this diagnosis i had from my gp and him saying, ""you've got diabetes 2,"" well, i should feel like that, shouldn't i?"
121;high;184;therapist;Yeah. it should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
121;high;185;client;Yeah, i mean.
121;high;186;therapist;What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? so, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
121;high;187;client;Yeah, i mean i'm a busy person. all right? i uh, my work uh, i work in insurance, so i'm always hopping from one place to another place.
121;high;188;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;189;client;Um, i haven't noticed.
121;high;190;therapist;Mh-hmm.
121;high;191;client;I really haven't noticed how, um, okay i get a bit--i suppose i get a bit out of breath sometimes.
121;high;192;therapist;Okay.
121;high;193;client;If i rush too much that-that's true. um, i suppose, um, i don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, i use one at a time.
121;high;194;therapist;So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? the vitality.
121;high;195;client;Oh, certainly the energy i have is-is not what i-what i had. i mean i do need to, you know, i'm busy but i do need to sit down, um, uh, i do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
121;high;196;therapist;Yeah, mh-hmm.
121;high;197;client;Um, more than i would normally.
121;high;198;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;199;client;But that would be, that would be about it.
121;high;200;therapist;Mh-hmm.
121;high;201;client;Um, is it getting worse? i don't know. i-i-i suppose. what worse? is it-is it increasing? well, to say, i don't really notice it.
121;high;202;therapist;You haven't noticed it. so it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. you know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
121;high;203;client;Yeah, yeah. um, at least, that's what i think. i mean i don't know if you're telling me that i should be more active or my gp is saying i should be more active.
121;high;204;therapist;Mh-hmm.
121;high;205;client;Um, as i say, uh, you know i-i don't do any regular form of exercise, i have to say, not anymore.
121;high;206;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;207;client;Um.
121;high;208;therapist;Okay.
121;high;209;client;But maybe i-maybe i don't know.
121;high;210;therapist;Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
121;high;211;client;I mean i've got uh, well i-i mean i've got a great lifestyle. i mean if it's very-it-it's very good. i mean i've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. and i've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. i used to coach rugby and i coached cricket when i finished playing. so-so i've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. and, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. we're a big gang, really.
121;high;212;therapist;Really? so what i'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
121;high;213;client;Oh, i think my life yeah. my life is great.
121;high;214;therapist;From your perspective, things are going well?
121;high;215;client;"My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick."
121;high;216;therapist;Yeah. it doesn't fit.
121;high;217;client;And um, no i'm not. but you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
121;high;218;therapist;Mh-hmm.
121;high;219;client;And i'm gonna have to take regular pills.
121;high;220;therapist;Right.
121;high;221;client;Well frankly, the only pills i take are sort of paracetamols.
121;high;222;therapist;Yeah. when you get uh, a headache.
121;high;223;client;For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
121;high;224;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;225;client;Um.
121;high;226;therapist;So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
121;high;227;client;Come on, you know.
121;high;228;therapist;And you know that's a bit too-
121;high;229;client;Well, life is too short.
121;high;230;therapist;Too much.
121;high;231;client;You know it's the truth.
121;high;232;therapist;Yeah. okay.
121;high;233;client;I mean you know—
121;high;234;therapist;And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well i'll follow this through, you know i'll-i'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. and i'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. you mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. and a number of things that we could talk about today. which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
121;high;235;client;Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, i split up-- my wife and i, we split up several years ago now. and, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
121;high;236;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;237;client;And um, i think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
121;high;238;therapist;Okay.
121;high;239;client;And i have to say that i'm not the best cook in the world.
121;high;240;therapist;Mh-hmm.
121;high;241;client;Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once i get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. and, uh, i-i do i suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. she's moved down to hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. anyway, but, um.
121;high;242;therapist;So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
121;high;243;client;Yeah, i mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
121;high;244;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;245;client;Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
121;high;246;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
121;high;247;client;And, yeah, yeah, yeah. i guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
121;high;248;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;249;client;"You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""hmm, i use d to have this."""
121;high;250;therapist;Hmm. yeah, yeah.
121;high;251;client;"And you think, "" this is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know."
121;high;252;therapist;Yeah. and your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
121;high;253;client;Oh, she would do all the cooking. yeah, yeah,
121;high;254;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;255;client;I mean, i never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
121;high;256;therapist;And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
121;high;257;client;Totally. i mean, i was just in charge of the wine, you know.
121;high;258;therapist;Mm-hmm. and now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
121;high;259;client;Well i-- this is what i'm saying. maybe i'm not thinking about it. maybe that's the thing.
121;high;260;therapist;Okay.
121;high;261;client;Maybe i'm just—
121;high;262;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;263;client;You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
121;high;264;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;265;client;And then there's-- i mean, okay, i confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, i'm hungry and mcdonald's is very convenient
121;high;266;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;267;client;Or kentucky fried or whatever.
121;high;268;therapist;Very appealing, isn't it?
121;high;269;client;You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- i mean, i do think of myself that maybe i should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. but then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your tv dinners.
121;high;270;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
121;high;271;client;So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
121;high;272;therapist;Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
121;high;273;client;Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. i mean, so that will happen occasionally if i've got a night in. but cooking-wise, no, i haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
121;high;274;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;275;client;For ages.
121;high;276;therapist;They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
121;high;277;client;Yeah. i do miss her breakfast. i have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
121;high;278;therapist;So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
121;high;279;client;Well—
121;high;280;therapist;-when you eat. that's one aspect. what other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
121;high;281;client;Well, i used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? i mean, i'd smoke a pack in a half a day. and i knew that wasn't doing me any good.
121;high;282;therapist;Right.
121;high;283;client;I mean the thing is when you're a-- i mean, i've always smoked. so, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
121;high;284;therapist;You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
121;high;285;client;Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
121;high;286;therapist;You still run and have a cigarette?
121;high;287;client;You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? you know, just before the game gets—
121;high;288;therapist;Hmm. hmm. yeah, part of the culture.
121;high;289;client;Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. and it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
121;high;290;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;291;client;That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
121;high;292;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;293;client;That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
121;high;294;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;295;client;Um, but now—
121;high;296;therapist;But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
121;high;297;client;"Well i-i, yeah. i was getting a bit sort of-- i was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and i thought, ""i'll cut this out."""
121;high;298;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;299;client;But i enjoy smoking. i really do enjoy it. so i cut it down to i suppose it's about 10 a day now.
121;high;300;therapist;Okay, so you meant to reduce.
121;high;301;client;Yeah, yeah.
121;high;302;therapist;You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
121;high;303;client;Yeah.
121;high;304;therapist;When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
121;high;305;client;Yeah, yeah. i sort of—
121;high;306;therapist;So you've made our decision to do that?
121;high;307;client;"It-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""why don't you give up? you've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" but i don't want to."
121;high;308;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;309;client;It's-it's-- i-i enjoy it, um—
121;high;310;therapist;Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?
121;high;311;client;Well, yeah. i mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-
121;high;312;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;313;client;You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, i suppose, in a way.
121;high;314;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;315;client;"So you say, ""okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]"
121;high;316;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;317;client;Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then i found i was drinking more coffee, you know.
121;high;318;therapist;But they go together so well. and sugar in the coffee?
121;high;319;client;Oh, yeah, yeah. i have two sugars. a couple of sugar in coffee. yeah, yeah.
121;high;320;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;321;client;So we cut that down as i say.
121;high;322;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;323;client;But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.
121;high;324;therapist;"You're drinking more coffee. so what i've heard you say so far is, if i can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""i went to the doctor."" you went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup."
121;high;325;client;"No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""i'm going for my annual, you know-"
121;high;326;therapist;Mit.
121;high;327;client;-warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. and i thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.
121;high;328;therapist;Got to check out, why not?
121;high;329;client;So i'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent
121;high;330;therapist;Hmm.
121;high;331;client;"-and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. so i thought, ""well, i'll go and have one."" and frankly, when i went along, i was very confident. i thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""hmm, i wish i was as healthy as"
121;high;332;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;333;client;Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. and it's the only thing i think he really came up with. i think-
121;high;334;therapist;So everything else looked pretty good?
121;high;335;client;My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.
121;high;336;therapist;Cholesterol good, your weight is good.
121;high;337;client;Yeah-yeah. not too bad.
121;high;338;therapist;Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.
121;high;339;client;Well, yeah, i've cut it down, yeah. i mean, that's been three years, mind.
121;high;340;therapist;And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. the tire is good, oil good.
121;high;341;client;Absolutely.
121;high;342;therapist;So we're looking good.
121;high;343;client;And then we come to this-
121;high;344;therapist;And ah, hang on.
121;high;345;client;-too much sugar in the tank, or something. i don't know.
121;high;346;therapist;Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.
121;high;347;client;So, yeah.
121;high;348;therapist;And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
121;high;349;client;No.
121;high;350;therapist;Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.
121;high;351;client;I mean, yeah. i mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and i mean, and probably you've-- i think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.
121;high;352;therapist;Mm.
121;high;353;client;You shouldn't smoke.
121;high;354;therapist;Yeah.
121;high;355;client;"And then i think to myself, ""well, maybe i shouldn't socialize."" and then after that, ""well, maybe i shouldn't be alive."""
121;high;356;therapist;So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-
121;high;357;client;You know. i mean, what-what-what's going on here? this is- this is- this is so many people's lives.
122;high;0;therapist;Well, i'm here because my mom wants me to be here.
122;high;1;client;Mm-hmm.
122;high;2;therapist;I don't really wanna be here, but it-it-- whatever.
122;high;3;client;Got it.
122;high;4;therapist;Um, she-she found my stash-
122;high;5;client;Uh-huh.
122;high;6;therapist;-and she freaked out, and she's going crazy over it. um, i don't why she was going through stuff in the first place, but whatever, so, now i'm here.
122;high;7;client;Mm-hmm.
122;high;8;therapist;Um, i've been hanging out with a new cool crowd of people that i really like.
122;high;9;client;Mm-hmm.
122;high;10;therapist;Uh, a-and-and that's-that's basically it.
122;high;11;client;Yeah. so-so you've got this new group of friends and-and, um, you-you actually kind of like where you're at with things right now. and your mom was going through your stuff and found your stash, and it's just turned into a, you know, all of this.
122;high;12;therapist;Yeah.
122;high;13;client;Yeah.
122;high;14;therapist;Yeah, basically.
123;low;0;therapist;Okay, i finished the exam. i have some good news and i have some not-so-good news. looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the good news.
123;low;1;client;That's great.
123;low;2;therapist;However, i'm pretty concerned about something i'm noticing in your mouth. actually, if you look up here, the roof of your mouth, i'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. and you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so i'm just wondering what's going on.
123;low;3;client;I don't smoke cigarettes.
123;low;4;therapist;Okay. well, as i said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like i was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots. and you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. it's called nicotinic stomatitis. and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. so, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? or is there something else that could be contributing to this? because i don't know what else might be causing it.
123;low;5;client;Well, the only thing-- i've never smoked cigarettes ever, um, but, um, when, um, when i go out with my friends, um, we like to go to, you know, we like to go out to lounges.
123;low;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.
123;low;7;client;And, um, you know, sometimes they're those- those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things. and we got some of those mini cigars that are swisher sweets, they come in peach and-and grape and-and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know, i've ever really used anything that-that's got tobacco in it.
123;low;8;therapist;Okay, so i think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. those are really bad for you. did you know that?
123;low;9;client;Really? bad? but they're just little, mini, little, cute little girly cigars.
123;low;10;therapist;Right. they're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important.
123;low;11;client;Well, i only use them just to relax. i mean, it's not like it's something that i would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, i mean, i only do it when we go out.
123;low;12;therapist;Uh-huh. well, that's, i mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. and as i said, i can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth, you're causing some serious damage, and this needs to stop. have you thought about quitting?
123;low;13;client;Well, i didn't really know i'd started.
123;low;14;therapist;What do you mean?
123;low;15;client;I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking, just something that i do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars.
125;high;0;therapist;The baby was up all night and i'm exhausted.
125;high;1;client;So, what you're saying is you've had a rough night?
125;high;2;therapist;Yes. she was up every three hours to eat, i don't understand it.
125;high;3;client;So, she needed to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?
126;low;0;therapist;Hello, kaylie. it looks like you're here to pick up a prescription today.
126;low;1;client;Yeah. my doctor said he called something in.
126;low;2;therapist;Okay. it looks like cholesterol statin. do you know how you're supposed to take the medication?
126;low;3;client;No, not really.
126;low;4;therapist;Well, you just take it once a day. did he tell you what side effects to expect?
126;low;5;client;No.
126;low;6;therapist;Well, some of the common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. there are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. if you have any of those, just call your doctor.
126;low;7;client;Okay. um, why am i taking this medication?
126;low;8;therapist;It's for your dyslipidemia. oh yeah, just one tablet a day. do you have any questions for me?
126;low;9;client;No, i guess not.
126;low;10;therapist;All right. great. have a good day.
126;low;11;client;Hello, kaylie. i see you're here to pick up a prescription today.
126;low;12;therapist;Yeah. my doctor said he called something in.
126;low;13;client;Oh, it looks like he called in cholesterol statin. do you know how you're supposed to take this medication?
126;low;14;therapist;No, not really.
126;low;15;client;Okay. well, you take this one once a day. did he tell you what side effects to expect?
126;low;16;therapist;No.
126;low;17;client;All right. well, some of the common side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. there are some severe side effects like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, cerebral infarction. if you have any of those, you should call your doctor.
126;low;18;therapist;Okay. um, so why am i taking this medication?
126;low;19;client;It's for your dyslipidemia. oh, and you should take one every day. do you have any questions for me?
126;low;20;therapist;I guess not.
126;low;21;client;All right. great. well, have a good afternoon.
126;low;22;therapist;Hello, kaylie, i'm lori, the pharmacist here at bulldog pharmacy. i see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by dr. ferris today. i wondered if you had a minute to talk to me. i just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions.
126;low;23;client;Sure. i'm just getting a few groceries.
126;low;24;therapist;Okay. what did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?
126;low;25;client;Well, he told me that i had a blood test for cholesterol, and that i should start taking this.
126;low;26;therapist;He's right. this medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. how did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?
126;low;27;client;He didn't really tell me. he just phoned it in.
126;low;28;therapist;Okay. well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. when do you normally take your medications?
126;low;29;client;Well, i take all of my other medications right before i go to bed. so i guess i could take it then.
126;low;30;therapist;Okay. that's perfect because cholesterol statin works best if it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. and you should take it every single day. it's important to keep that up. where do you store your medications?
126;low;31;client;I store my medications, uh, in my nightstand, right by my bed.
126;low;32;therapist;All right. do you have any children in your home?
126;low;33;client;No.
126;low;34;therapist;Okay. well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. what did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?
126;low;35;client;He didn't mention anything about that.
126;low;36;therapist;All right. well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. but you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. if they seem really severe to you, then you should call dr. ferris and talk to him about that. also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. so check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. and lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. so if you use grapefruit juice every day, i probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication.
126;low;37;client;Just so i know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?
131;low;0;therapist;Good morning. it's really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking.
131;low;1;client;Good morning.
131;low;2;therapist;What have you got in mind, what do you want from us?
131;low;3;client;Well, i need some medication if you can offer me some.
131;low;4;therapist;Absolutely, we're in the right place for that.
131;low;5;client;And, uh, whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-free.
131;low;6;therapist;Okay. well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop.
131;low;7;client;It's, uh, just these days-- i think these days i'm-i'm finding that, um, i'm smoking 20, 30 a day, i'm getting sick of it. it's, you know, i've seen my friends have stopped smoking too and it's kind of they're looking at me weird these days like i'm the only one left who's still smoking.
131;low;8;therapist;Oh, good, and so feeling under pressure here.
131;low;9;client;Especially the other night i was at the restaurant, it was a bit-- you know, it was a bit embarrassing i'm the only one walk walking out.
131;low;10;therapist;And so that-that can't feel a little uncomfortable being by yourself. so that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's a little getting smelly and it's getting embarrassing.
131;low;11;client;Mm-hmm.
131;low;12;therapist;Any other reasons?
131;low;13;client;Um, it's expensive these days.
131;low;14;therapist;How much does it actually cost you a week?
131;low;15;client;It's-it's about-- um, i'll buy and go through a pack a day, so it's almost £7.
131;low;16;therapist;£7 a week or a day?
131;low;17;client;£7 a day today, so-
131;low;18;therapist;So your pack a day—
131;low;19;client;-you're talking about £40, uh—
131;low;20;therapist;£50 a week.
131;low;21;client;£50 a week.
131;low;22;therapist;Even more mess, you see.
131;low;23;client;Yeah.
131;low;24;therapist;Okay. so we're talking about spending £50 a week-
131;low;25;client;Yeah.
131;low;26;therapist;-being one of the few left smoking in your crowd, and not liking the smell. that sounds like three reasons.
131;low;27;client;Mm-hmm.
131;low;28;therapist;Do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes?
131;low;29;client;Yeah.
131;low;30;therapist;Great, okay. so have you got a date in mind when you'd like to stop smoking?
131;low;31;client;Well, what you do-- what do you suggest?
131;low;32;therapist;Generally, it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains.
131;low;33;client;Mm-hmm.
131;low;34;therapist;What are the main reasons why you actually smoke? what do you enjoy most about it?
131;low;35;client;Um, it's just entertainment. something, um, when i bored, it's got-- i've got-- i smoke-
131;low;36;therapist;Mm-hmm.
131;low;37;client;-or sometimes i go out, but as i said, i'm the only one kind of outside.
131;low;38;therapist;Okay. what do you think you'll miss most about it?
131;low;39;client;The-- um, it takes away a lot of my stresses.
131;low;40;therapist;Mm-hmm, what sort of stresses?
131;low;41;client;Just, uh, when i- when i go down, uh, for-for a break at work.
131;low;42;therapist;Mm-hmm.
131;low;43;client;I never go down, i just need a break away from it all, just shut off. so, uh, i-i really enjoyed that. the cigarette just helps me calm down.
131;low;44;therapist;Yeah. and what is your favorite cigarette of the day?
131;low;45;client;It's definitely the one at the end of the evening.
131;low;46;therapist;Okay, so the end of the day-
131;low;47;client;Yeah.
131;low;48;therapist;-the thing that helps you just unwind, put an end to the work section and move into your own time.
131;low;49;client;Yeah.
131;low;50;therapist;Okay. so after you've had the quit date, what do you think you might do when it it's the first day at work and it's time to go home if you're not gonna have a cigarette?
131;low;51;client;I guess, um, i'll just- i'll just have, you know, some fresh air as well, but this time without a cigarette in my hand but to try and give myself regular breaks maybe, i don't know.
131;low;52;therapist;Okay.
131;low;53;client;It's one of those tough things.
132;high;0;therapist;Hello, again, mr. green. it's really nice to see you again. if you remember last week, we looked at your results here and you've got impaired glucose tolerance and you were a bit worried about type two diabetes, your blood pressure and your cholesterol are up a bit too. so today, we're meeting up to talk through some of the things that you could do for yourself that might improve the situation. and as you know, there's all sorts of things can affect your health. so can we just have a bit of a general chat, but how are you getting on?
132;high;1;client;Well, i suppose you're gonna give me a row and tell me it's all self-inflicted and i've got to change my ways and give up the things i enjoy.
132;high;2;therapist;Actually, i'm not going to do that because you're the boss. it's up to you what you want to do with you about your own health.
132;high;3;client;The doc said i've got to take pills for the rest of my life.
132;high;4;therapist;You don't seem too happy about that.
132;high;5;client;Well, i feel fine, but the-the doc said it could save my life.
132;high;6;therapist;Well, there's a lot of things you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well. so what we can do today is wee up some of those things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those kinds of things. so we're just gonna start and see how you feel as we go.
132;high;7;client;Okay, what should i do first?
132;high;8;therapist;Well, it's very much up to you, you're the boss of your own life. where would you like to start?
132;high;9;client;Where do you think i should start?
132;high;10;therapist;Well, i could give you my opinion. um, and i can give you lots of information, but i think you know the score pretty well. and i think you'd know what i would say.
132;high;11;client;Yeah, uh, you tell me, stop smoking and lose weight and take more exercise, wouldn’t you?
132;high;12;therapist;Absolutely. spot on. so stopping smoking would have a huge impact, that would have a big impact very early on. losing weight would also have a big impact because that would help with your blood pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes risk. so what-what'd you think about those things? uh,
132;high;13;client;Uh, i loved to lose weight but it's so hard giving up the things you enjoy.
132;high;14;therapist;It’s really tough. it's hard to know where to start, isn't it?
132;high;15;client;I really should do. or shouldn't i,
132;high;16;therapist;How important is it for you then to lose weight?
132;high;17;client;Well, i'd like to see my children settled and my grandchildren growing up and i should,suppose i should be an example to them.
132;high;18;therapist;So can it be in there for your-your family's important to you?
132;high;19;client;Yes. i want to be there for them, but not a burden to them.
132;high;20;therapist;Yeah. so w-where do you think you can start with that?
132;high;21;client;Uh, i've been thinking about them a lot lately, and i want to be there for them. so have to do what i need to, to improve my health.
132;high;22;therapist;What's kind of the first thing you might think about doing?
132;high;23;client;You know, to start with, i could cut down on my drinking. um, that's adding to my weight and to my blood pressure, isn't it?
133;high;0;therapist;Thanks for coming in today. i guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.
133;high;1;client;Mm.
133;high;2;therapist;Yeah. and you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. so today i wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, i'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.
133;high;3;client;Right. neat. what, um, what have i changed, what am i—
133;high;4;therapist;What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'cause i noticed you've—
133;high;5;client;I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal p again.
133;high;6;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;7;client;I mean, i've been thinking about, um, how i could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.
133;high;8;therapist;Sure. so what i'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.
133;high;9;client;Mm.
133;high;10;therapist;And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. what's the other side, because i guess when i talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. so i'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—
133;high;11;client;Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, i was- i had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? and, you know, it just doesn't work out here.
133;high;12;therapist;Okay.
133;high;13;client;I don't have a, uh, uh, i don't know what that is.
133;high;14;therapist;Sure. so life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-
133;high;15;client;Yes.
133;high;16;therapist;The expectation of life on the inside something?
133;high;17;client;Yeah, it's worse.
133;high;18;therapist;Yeah?
133;high;19;client;Yeah.
133;high;20;therapist;So tell me how you've been managing. 'cause i don't know if you'd been back dealing? how have you been managing to-to-to—
133;high;21;client;I haven't yet, i mean-
133;high;22;therapist;Okay.
133;high;23;client;-the, uh, the offer's there.
133;high;24;therapist;Yeah?
133;high;25;client;Um, i don't know why i haven't said that i will yet but i mean-
133;high;26;therapist;Uh, tell me-
133;high;27;client;-it's there.
133;high;28;therapist;It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?
133;high;29;client;Yeah.
133;high;30;therapist;You've been in the system, so lots of context. so this isn't a new challenge for you.
133;high;31;client;No.
133;high;32;therapist;So what stopped you over the last-- how long have you been out now?
133;high;33;client;How long have i been out?
133;high;34;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;35;client;Three weeks, one day.
133;high;36;therapist;Three weeks, isn't it?
133;high;37;client;Three weeks, one day.
133;high;38;therapist;So what's been there? what's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?
133;high;39;client;I don't know.
133;high;40;therapist;22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.
133;high;41;client;Um, i'd- i- you know, i kind of told myself not to, you know, just before i left. and then i'm just kind of with it and i don't quite know why. [clears throat] i dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why i haven't yet. it's just that i don't- i just don't think it'll work the way i always dream it will you know, i see myself up like, whatever, if i do that again, the next leg is a long one. a real long one.
133;high;42;therapist;Okay.
133;high;43;client;And i-i can't go back there. there's no way i'm going back there.
133;high;44;therapist;Right. so the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?
133;high;45;client;No, never lasts.
133;high;46;therapist;Never lasts. mm. you seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
133;high;47;client;Yep. i've been in crossroads for 12 years.
133;high;48;therapist;Mm. but there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.
133;high;49;client;Yeah. and- [crosstalk]
133;high;50;therapist;Yeah. and it sounds like maybe like-
133;high;51;client;-sort of opposite, yeah.
133;high;52;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;53;client;You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, i guess.
133;high;54;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;55;client;But i don't know. you know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.
133;high;56;therapist;Okay. okay. so—
133;high;57;client;Do you have an idea?
133;high;58;therapist;No. well, i've-i've got lots of ideas, but i'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.
133;high;59;client;Mm.
133;high;60;therapist;But i guess what i'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. haven't gone back into that lifestyle. what-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. i'm not sure about this other bit over here. what keeping you in that place?
133;high;61;client;Fiona?
133;high;62;therapist;Yeah?
133;high;63;client;Yeah.
133;high;64;therapist;Tell me about fiona?
133;high;65;client;She's told me that it's over if i do it. you know, i mean, she-- what tell you about, fiona i mean she's been with me. she's the one who stayed through all the shit. and i owe her-
133;high;66;therapist;Okay.
133;high;67;client;Something.
133;high;68;therapist;Okay. so you've been with fiona for how long?
133;high;69;client;12 years.
133;high;70;therapist;12 years. okay. so she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again i'm out of here?
133;high;71;client;Yeah. she's actually got the black and white line down now.
133;high;72;therapist;Okay. and it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.
133;high;73;client;It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.
133;high;74;therapist;Yeah, yeah.
133;high;75;client;Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.
133;high;76;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;77;client;I mean. and it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.
133;high;78;therapist;Okay. so something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?
133;high;79;client;Yeah. i think she has. i don't think i have.
133;high;80;therapist;Okay. so what's fiona want you from you?
133;high;81;client;She just wants me. i mean, she just wants someone to be there. me. she-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.
133;high;82;therapist;She wants him. so which him does she want, daryl?
133;high;83;client;The one that, you know—
133;high;84;therapist;Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?
133;high;85;client;Yeah, that's the one.
133;high;86;therapist;Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?
133;high;87;client;No, no. no one would want him. i don't want him. he's a fuckwit, right? she wants the one that she fell in love with.
133;high;88;therapist;Okay.
133;high;89;client;Yeah.
133;high;90;therapist;So what's it gonna take to reclaim this daryl that she fell in love with?
133;high;91;client;If i had the answer to that, i wouldn't need to be sitting here.
133;high;92;therapist;Sure, yeah.
133;high;93;client;And i mean, i honest- i don't know, man. i don't know. i-i wish i knew somewhere i could start that, you know, could give it to her, but i-i can't. i-i don't know.
133;high;94;therapist;"All right. well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, daryl. so what did fiona fall in love with? what were the qualities of daryl that she said, ""this is him""?"
133;high;95;client;"I was pretty romantic. i mean, i was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, i was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. and we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? and just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""oh, man, you two. you two have just got it,"" you know? and we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. we were young. how do you become young? uh, you know, i'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?"
133;high;96;therapist;I know.
133;high;97;client;Like if i'm not careful, i will be.
133;high;98;therapist;Sure. everyone will age, but that will happen on time.
133;high;99;client;Yeah, certainly.
133;high;100;therapist;Um, but that's okay. so-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?
133;high;101;client;Yeah.
133;high;102;therapist;Yeah?
133;high;103;client;Yeah.
133;high;104;therapist;Yeah. and you're still with her?
133;high;105;client;Yeah, yep.
133;high;106;therapist;Yeah. so catch me up with the conversations you've had with fiona about this crossroads you're at. you know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? you could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.
133;high;107;client;You know what? she hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. that's how black and white she is. she's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? what i could do, and- or i kind of go with that, but none of them are-- you know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. i mean, it-- i started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, i need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.
133;high;108;therapist;Okay. all right. so-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?
133;high;109;client;A little bit that. yeah, little-little bit tense. yeah, that's fair.
133;high;110;therapist;Yeah. don't put words in your mouth. i'm sure if that is—
133;high;111;client;No, they are.
133;high;112;therapist;Oh, yeah? yeah?
133;high;113;client;I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but i mean, yeah, tense is the right word.
133;high;114;therapist;Second, i'd like to talk, daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? so on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. so, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—
133;high;115;client;Well, i don't know. i haven't got little, um, nuggets of where i could go. i've just got like this feeling that i should go somewhere.
133;high;116;therapist;Okay. yep. so a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?
133;high;117;client;Yeah.
133;high;118;therapist;It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?
133;high;119;client;Yeah. no idea.
133;high;120;therapist;No idea. okay. so i'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. you're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?
133;high;121;client;[nods].
133;high;122;therapist;"Yeah. so, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. and-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""time to move on""."
133;high;123;client;Yeah. well, um—
133;high;124;therapist;And now you've got—
133;high;125;client;Not many.
133;high;126;therapist;Not many?
133;high;127;client;Mm-hmm.
133;high;128;therapist;But some.
133;high;129;client;Um, oh, i've got. yeah, one. [chuckles]
133;high;130;therapist;One?
133;high;131;client;One.
133;high;132;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;133;client;Mm, yeah.
133;high;134;therapist;Yeah?
133;high;135;client;Okay, so, um—
133;high;136;therapist;Tell me something about that.
133;high;137;client;Well, he-he was- he was inside with me the first time i was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor.
133;high;138;therapist;Okay.
133;high;139;client;So, he's the- he did it.
133;high;140;therapist;He did it?
133;high;141;client;I don't know how the fuck he did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even a real addict, he was just-- well, i mean, i don't know. he's very good with people.
133;high;142;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;143;client;Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, i don't know how he did it.
133;high;144;therapist;Cool. so how interested would you be to find out more information about how he did it? 'cause i'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship.
133;high;145;client;Yeah, but i can't ever be a drug counselor.
133;high;146;therapist;No, i'm not suggesting you-- no, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-
133;high;147;client;Yeah.
133;high;148;therapist;To a transition about being in a different place.
133;high;149;client;Yeah. i think he would have found some higher power. they find-- i'm not gonna find one of them.
133;high;150;therapist;Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?
133;high;151;client;Yeah.
133;high;152;therapist;So that might work for him, but what might work for you?
133;high;153;client;I don't know. that's why i'm here.
133;high;154;therapist;Sure.
133;high;155;client;I don't know what that is.
133;high;156;therapist;Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-
133;high;157;client;Okay.
133;high;158;therapist;Thing. whatever it is.
133;high;159;client;Good luck.
133;high;160;therapist;Well, it's a search, isn't it?
133;high;161;client;Yeah, i don't mean to be rude-
133;high;162;therapist;No.
133;high;163;client;-but i do mean it's a big ask.
133;high;164;therapist;Yep, it is a big ask. so what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?
133;high;165;client;Fucking guts.
133;high;166;therapist;Guts? yeah?
133;high;167;client;Is it a quality?
133;high;168;therapist;I think it is.
133;high;169;client;Yeah, i'd need some of them.
133;high;170;therapist;Yeah? so you're the sort of guy, daryl, with guts?
133;high;171;client;Am i?
133;high;172;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;173;client;No, not yet.
133;high;174;therapist;Not yet?
133;high;175;client;Well, no i'm not.
133;high;176;therapist;Yeah?
133;high;177;client;No, i don't have that-that-that much courage.\
133;high;178;therapist;Yet you're sitting here with me today-
133;high;179;client;Oh, i have to.
133;high;180;therapist;-and-and-and you're talking about stuff.
133;high;181;client;Yeah.
133;high;182;therapist;Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking with me-
133;high;183;client;Oh, okay.
133;high;184;therapist;-about stuff that's-that's quite deep-
133;high;185;client;Yeah.
133;high;186;therapist;-in a way. um, that takes guts. that takes courage.
133;high;187;client;All right.
133;high;188;therapist;In my view, it does.
133;high;189;client;Okay.
133;high;190;therapist;'cause you could've come in here and said-
133;high;191;client;It's a bit awkward.
133;high;192;therapist;"""look, ken, you know, i'll come in, report in, i'm outta here."""
133;high;193;client;Ah, yeah. i could've done that
133;high;194;therapist;You could've done that, but you're not. so i'm wondering what's different? 'cause you may have done that in the past, i don't know, daryl, with other people like me, but-but sounds like something's different this time.
133;high;195;client;I'm older, you know? it's not as much fun.
133;high;196;therapist;Yeah?
133;high;197;client;I used to take the piss outta you guys-
133;high;198;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;199;client;-all day long. we all do, but-
133;high;200;therapist;Sure.
133;high;201;client;-it's not funny. i mean, and you're-you're a good guy, i imagine. i mean, in fact, you don't deserve my shit. i just-- i don't know. good luck.
133;high;202;therapist;I kind of see a sense of sadness there when you have to kind of think about this.
133;high;203;client;Oh, sadness. you know, i don't wanna wallow, you know? you know, you've gotta take, you know-- you make your own opportunity in life, don't you?
133;high;204;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;205;client;I just never did.
133;high;206;therapist;Okay. so i'm interested in this idea, let's, uh-- opportunities come and go all the time.
133;high;207;client;Do they?
133;high;208;therapist;They do.
133;high;209;client;All right. not to me.
133;high;210;therapist;Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.
133;high;211;client;Oh, yeah. oh, heaps of those opportunities.
133;high;212;therapist;And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and i'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?
133;high;213;client;Yeah, well, the different world isn't offering me opportunities. the different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. so it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you know, old behaviors.
133;high;214;therapist;Sure, sure. you're in the system-
133;high;215;client;Mm-hmm.
133;high;216;therapist;-you're not in the system. pick up that, where is it gonna take you?
133;high;217;client;The system?
133;high;218;therapist;Yeah, what-what's gonna happen if you start dealing again?
133;high;219;client;Man, i've been fighting that system-
133;high;220;therapist;Yeah.
133;high;221;client;-and all it takes me back is to the-the inside-
133;high;222;therapist;Okay, okay.
133;high;223;client;-i mean—
133;high;224;therapist;So-so again, i'm-i'm wondering about this other world, and you're saying it doesn't look to attractive at the moment.
133;high;225;client;Well, i can't see it.
133;high;226;therapist;You can't se it?
133;high;227;client;You know what, if i knew what they'd look like-
