I mean, I've been working real hard. Sometimes I can't come home for dinner, so I'm having to go out to eat at Applebee's or something like that, so-- but she seems to have a bigger problem, I really don't see what the big deal is.;;neutral3;high;diet and weight loss management;1;therapist;Okay, and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning you right now, or anything like that?;reflection;3;high;diet and weight loss management;2;client;I-I-I feel fine.;;neutral3;high;diet and weight loss management;3;therapist;Okay.;other;3;high;diet and weight loss management;4;client;I mean, my-my work is really man-manual labor-intensive so I'm usually working out in-in the hot sun the majority of the day, so I'm usually sweating out any like bad things I put in my system, so—;;neutral3;high;diet and weight loss management;5;therapist;Okay. Have you noticed putting on any weight, or anything like--?;question;3;high;diet and weight loss management;6;client;Well, a little bit, but nothing too-- you know.

Have you gone to-- for a visit or anything recently?;question;3;high;diet and weight loss management;8;client;Well, yeah, I've been to the doctor about maybe last year for a physical, but-- I mean, everything showed up to be fine, so—;;neutral3;high;diet and weight loss management;9;therapist;Okay. But you feel that you feel good?;question;3;high;diet and weight loss management;10;client;Yeah.;;neutral3;high;diet and weight loss management;11;therapist;Okay. Um, and so what I hear is that you're-- you feel like your wife might be, uh, overreacting to this?;reflection;3;high;diet and weight loss management;12;client;Well, I mean, not really overreacting. I know that she loves me and I know she-she wants me, uh, you know, live a long time and be healthy, but just sometimes, especially if you work a hard job, like kinda going out to eat at these places kinda makes you feel a little bit better about your situation.;;neutral3;high;diet and weight loss management;13;therapist;Sure. Sure. Okay. Um, and so one thing I'd just like to do is maybe give you some information on, um, maybe obesity or diabetes if you're interested or open to that.

I just felt like something different.

I wonder what have you heard about how having an oral piercing can affect your-your teeth or your gums?;question;4;high;managing life;17;client;I don't actually, really. I-I mean, I'm sure that it might push on my gums or teeth, but I don't know how much it will impact that much. I've pretty good teeth. I don't know.;;neutral4;high;managing life;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;4;high;managing life;19;client;I don't really know [unintelligible 00:01:04];;neutral4;high;managing life;20;therapist;You do. you have beautiful teeth as I always tell you-;other;4;high;managing life;21;client;[laughs] Thanks.;;neutral4;high;managing life;22;therapist;every time you come in.;other;4;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah.;;neutral4;high;managing life;24;therapist;Um, I mean I have had some patients with oral piercings and they can erode some of the gum right, um, just right there at the front.;therapist_input;4;high;managing life;25;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral4;high;managing life;26;therapist;Um, so that's one-one thing, and the other is, um, I do see fair amount of chipped teeth-;therapist_input;4;high;managing life;27;client;Oh, yeah.;;neutral4;high;managing life;28;therapist;just from contact with it. I wonder What are your thoughts about that?;question;4;high;managing life;29;client;Well, I definitely don't want it mess with my teeth. I know I kinda already have low gums to begin with, like you've been telling me for a while, and I have to flo-floss, which I-;;change4;high;managing life;30;therapist;Yes, flossing.;reflection;4;high;managing life;31;client;Um, which I'm not doing but, um, yeah, I guess, I don't really wanna wreck my teeth 'cause-- Yeah, I didn't really notice any of the chipping.;;change4;high;managing life;32;therapist;There's nothing yet.;reflection;4;high;managing life;33;client;I guess I'm not paying attention to it.;;neutral4;high;managing life;34;therapist;Yeah. There's certainly been-- There's no problems and you, as you said, only have had it for a short time.;reflection;4;high;managing life;35;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral4;high;managing life;36;therapist;"Um, what would- what would make you decide, ""This is something that's not right for me?""";question;4;high;managing life;37;client;I don't know, I guess if I started to see that it was actually causing a problem, then I might.;;change4;high;managing life;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;4;high;managing life;39;client;But for now-- I mean, I just got and-;;neutral4;high;managing life;40;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;4;high;managing life;41;client;and it looks pretty cool.;;sustain4;high;managing life;42;therapist;I guess that it does.;other;4;high;managing life;43;client;Yeah, I kinda-- Yeah.;;neutral4;high;managing life;44;therapist;Yeah, it looks nice. So, you want to monitor it and-and-;therapist_input;4;high;managing life;45;client;Yeah.;;neutral4;high;managing life;46;therapist;-really watch-;therapist_input;4;high;managing life;47;client;Yeah.;;neutral4;high;managing life;48;therapist;the effect? Okay.;therapist_input;4;high;managing life;49;client;Yeah. I guess if I really start to see a problem-- I mean, this might not last forever, but my teeth, I'm hoping-;;change4;high;managing life;50;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;4;high;managing life;51;client;-will kind of stick [unintelligible 00:02:30];;neutral4;high;managing life;52;therapist;Emily, you said it so well it-;other;4;high;managing life;53;client;Yeah.;;neutral4;high;managing life;54;therapist;-the-the piercing might not last forever, but your teeth really are-;reflection;4;high;managing life;55;client;Yeah.;;neutral4;high;managing life;56;therapist;-hopefully forever. So, okay, well thanks for-for talking about it-;other;4;high;managing life;57;client;Yeah.;;neutral4;high;managing life;58;therapist;-with me, and also before I do the exam, you know, I'm always on your case about flossing, so maybe we can take [inaudible 00:02:46]-;other;6;high;asthma management;0;therapist;Hi, Sal. Thanks for coming in today.;other;6;high;asthma management;1;client;No problem.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;2;therapist;I saw that your doctor made the referral and, um, and I really appreciate you taking the time to come and make that appointment.;therapist_input;6;high;asthma management;3;client;Yeah, it's-it's a bit of an inconvenience I'd say, but I'm here though.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;4;therapist;So you made it in here-;reflection;6;high;asthma management;5;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;6;therapist;- and do you have a sense of-of what some of the doctor's concerns were that led her to refer you?;question;6;high;asthma management;7;client;I don't know, something about changing my life even more. You know, the smoking's been changed, and now it's, you know, cut down the drinking, get rid of those extra smokes, get rid of my dog. I don't know what else have to do.;;sustain6;high;asthma management;8;therapist;So your asthma has been acting up and there's a lot of stuff, not just the asthma going on?;reflection;6;high;asthma management;9;client;Yeah, there's a lot of stress too. My wife's still on maternity leave, she's not getting paid, she's with the baby right now. And I'm the only person that's working right now, and plus I got to change all these things that are going on in my life.;;sustain6;high;asthma management;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. Almost—;reflection;6;high;asthma management;11;client;Yeah, it's a lot.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;12;therapist;Almost overwhelming it sounds like.;reflection;6;high;asthma management;13;client;Yeah, yeah, it is overwhelming. It is.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;14;therapist;Well, we have about, I guess, 15 or 20 minutes together and I wonder, would it be okay, if we took a couple of minutes and just kind of looked at all of the different things that are going on for you and maybe you can let me know, what would be the most helpful to spend-spend some time on?;question;6;high;asthma management;15;client;Yeah, it just feels like everything's all over the place but I guess we got to start somewhere.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;16;therapist;Okay. Well, one of the things that-that we use are these-- it's kind of like a worksheet and it's an agenda-setting worksheet basically.;therapist_input;6;high;asthma management;17;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;18;therapist;So if you were to-to list all of the different things that people around you are saying that you need to work on or you need to change, what would some of those things be? And, Sal, just because we write them down here, it doesn't mean that you have to change them.;question;6;high;asthma management;19;client;Okay.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;20;therapist;It really-- You're in the driver's seat, so it's just to kind of put all the cards on the table, so to speak.;other;6;high;asthma management;21;client;Okay. Um, okay, that sounds good. As long as I'm not changing anything and we're just kind of putting, um, I guess, pen to paper or something.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;22;therapist;Yep.;other;6;high;asthma management;23;client;Um, okay, so my asthma.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;24;therapist;Okay, so asthma is one.;reflection;6;high;asthma management;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;26;therapist;What else?;question;6;high;asthma management;27;client;Um, the fact that they want me to get rid of Oscar, that's-that's my dog.;;sustain6;high;asthma management;28;therapist;So your dog, and-and the doctor's saying the dog's—;reflection;6;high;asthma management;29;client;Well, he's-- Yeah, he's saying it's a main-- It's a main contributor to my asthma problems.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;30;therapist;Okay.;other;6;high;asthma management;31;client;Which I don't- I don't- I don't- I don't buy it and I can't just get rid of him like that, but it's something that's there.;;sustain6;high;asthma management;32;therapist;That's pretty shocking to be told that you have to get rid of your dog.;reflection;6;high;asthma management;33;client;Yeah. The dog has been there before my wife. I know I've had him longer.;;sustain6;high;asthma management;34;therapist;Hmm. So that's a huge stress right now?;reflection;6;high;asthma management;35;client;Yeah. Yeah, it's- it's a big stress, it's like my best friend, so that's one of the important things. Also, I guess, cutting down these last cigarettes I've been working on.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;36;therapist;Okay, so smoking and-and I'm working towards quitting completely sounds like that's a goal for you?;therapist_input;6;high;asthma management;37;client;Um, finances is a problem right now too.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;38;therapist;Okay, so money.;reflection;6;high;asthma management;39;client;Time, I got to come to all these appointments and I'm taking time off work, which obviously is the money factor, right?;;neutral6;high;asthma management;40;therapist;Right. Right, right. So the appointments and time.;reflection;6;high;asthma management;41;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;42;therapist;Um, and some of these things are kind of related to each other I think we're already seeing.;reflection;6;high;asthma management;43;client;Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there's something going on. And, um, also my drinking, I got to cut down my drinking too.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;44;therapist;Okay, wow. So there's a lot happening right now, Sal. Anything else that that's concerning you?;question;6;high;asthma management;45;client;No. It's just overwhelming when you see them everything they're, you know?;;sustain6;high;asthma management;46;therapist;Right. Well, so where would you-- I mean, if you-you had to pick somewhere, one or two kind of high priorities or-or things to talk about in our time this morning, where would you wanna start?;question;6;high;asthma management;47;client;I think- I think the thoughts about the dog has been definitely bothering me, that's been one.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;48;therapist;Okay.;other;6;high;asthma management;49;client;And, um, my-my asthma is out of control too. So maybe those two.;;change6;high;asthma management;50;therapist;Okay, and those are ones that are pretty related to each other-;reflection;6;high;asthma management;51;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral6;high;asthma management;52;therapist; sounds like. Okay.;other;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So I know we've determined that you sprained your ankle yesterday and I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit about how that happened?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Um, it's really stupid. Uh, I was at a pub crawl last night and you know how pub crawls are. You have a few drinks and then I thought it was a really good idea to catch up with my friends who are, yeah, they're in front of me. So I just like jumped off the stairs of the bus and I was wearing these like stilettos 'cause it was a 90s-themed pub crawl. Anyway, and then I just like fell on my ankle. It was really embarrassing.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Sounds like a wild night.;reflection;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Yeah.;other;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;It was a lot of fun but I didn't do any dancing after that.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;No, I guess that that would be the end of your, uh, shaking and moving. I know-- I wonder if you'd be open to exploring your alcohol use and what that looks like during the week.;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Uh, sure, uh, as long as we don't talk too much about like vodka 'cause I'm still, ugh, a little—;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;You're still feeling the effects of-;reflection;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Yeah.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;-last night, are you?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;A little bit.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Oh wow, it was-;other;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;really a rough night.;reflection;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Well, it's normal.;;sustain7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;So what is a typical week for you as far as your alcohol use?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Um, well, me and my friends kinda, uh, we party on the weekend and, you know, we're all university students and so it's just normal, um, to have a few drinks.;;sustain7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;So a few drinks is nothing new to you?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;No.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;And what does a few drinks look like? Is that per night? Is it two drinks?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Um, per night, uh, like if we go out oh, it's a lot. It's like I can drink probably like seven or eight drinks like if I'm going hard. Um, and then, you know, like maybe when I get home from school, a long day at the library, have a beer or two, so.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;All right. Do you have any concerns at all about your alcohol use?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;No. I-I don't know. It's normal for university students I feel.;;sustain7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay, so at this point, you're not too concerned and you think that, you know, this is what the other students are doing?;reflection;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Yeah.;;sustain7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Would you be open to kind of looking at the low-risk drinking alcohol guidelines?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah, sure.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;I don't know how you're feeling right now but I'm just wondering if we can take a-just a quick glance at this-;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yeah.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;-and what the safe limits are for women is 10 drinks for women a week with about two drinks, uh, per day.;therapist_input;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Oh really?;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Yeah.;other;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Wow.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Where do you- where do you feel you fall into that?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Uh, uh I would say a little over that.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay, okay.;other;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Especially with midterms coming up.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;Okay, so it's kind of a way to cope through stress?;reflection;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;Right, and is that something that has been, you know, a way of coping for a while?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah. Yeah, I guess.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Okay. Does that concern you at all?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, I mean, the 10 drinks seems like not a lot, uh, for like-for me and like my tolerance.;;sustain7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;I guess I've kind of built it up over the years.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Okay.;other;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Um, so that's a little- a little bit, uh, concerning I guess to me.;;change7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Do you feel like you have any reasons to kind of bring your alcohol use down within the limits?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Uh, any reason to? Uh, I guess health-health reasons.;;change7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Tell me more about that.;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Um, well, I mean, clearly I don't feel good right now. Um, and it's-- I definitely feel more productive when I don't have a hangover. Uh, so I see a benefit.;;change7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;So you can see some advantages to reducing the amount of drinking-;reflection;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Yeah.;;change7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;-um, that you consume during the week?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Yeah;;change7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;Is this something you would be willing to explore with me a little further at another time maybe when you're feeling a little bit better? Is this something you'd be willing to come back and talk to me about?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah, yeah, I think when I'm feeling a little- a little better. Maybe when I haven't gone all out the-the night before and sprained my ankle.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;I'd love to, uh, set up an appointment for you if you can come in later this week or early next week to-;therapist_input;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Okay, okay.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;kind of explore this a little bit further and maybe some of those advantages of reducing to the safe limits. is that something that we could do?;question;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Sure. Yeah, just not on a Saturday morning. [chuckles];;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;That's okay with me.;other;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Okay.;;neutral7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Thank you.;other;7;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Yeah. Sounds good.;;neutral8;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;So, what brings you here, Bob? What's, what can I do to help?;question;8;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah. Yeah, well, the only reason I'm here is 'cause my wife thinks I've got a problem with smoking. I've been smoking all my life and, uh, six months ago, uh, she thought, she got into this health kick, right? And now everyone who smokes is evil. And, uh, so that's why I'm here just to please her, get her off my back and—;;sustain8;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;So, you're not too happy to be here. This is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon.;reflection;8;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Yeah. That's an understatement. I mean, I'm supposed to be at work right now, too, right? So-;;neutral8;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;You've taken time off you, it's costing you time and money being here.;reflection;8;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Yeah, yeah. I'm only here because my wife forced me to come, you know. Like this has come to a head six months of just nagging me, relentless every day, because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit.;;sustain8;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;So, let me ask you this, Bob, what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?;question;8;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Well, she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles from the paper about second-hand smoke and—;;change8;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Wow, that she's been showing you and making you read.;reflection;8;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Yeah, I've got to read this. That's my reading assignment for breakfast and I want to go out and have-- We used to go out and have a cigarette together at the table. Now I have to go outside in this weather, you know, what's that about? And she used to smoke more than me and now she's like holier than now?;;neutral8;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;So, you're pretty angry about it. It's pretty outraging that you're forced to change your whole life because of a decision she made six months ago.;reflection;8;high;smoking cessation;11;client;And she's got my kids on this against me, you know, my son and my daughter, they're, it's like, they're ganging up on me, you know what I mean?;;neutral8;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;So, from your perspective, do you see any consequences to your smoking?;question;8;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, the big one of course is how it's affecting my wife and the family. Like my dad's 85, he still smokes. I mean, yeah, you know, sometimes I thought of quitting, but I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I can-- I don't know if I can quit.;;change8;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;So, let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario 'cause there's a lot of pieces to it. Your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too. So, you're sort of isolated, you're put in a corner and you're being told this is something you have to do, you have no choice in the matter.;reflection;8;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral8;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;You have a few concerns about your health, but that's not really the driving force. It sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore. Does that pretty much sum up--?;reflection;8;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Yeah. Yeah. I-I'm just, I don't want to lose her or my family over smoking.;;change8;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you. That you would do anything.;reflection;8;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Well, yeah, I mean, we've been married over 25 years, and uh, we've never had any major problems. Like this is-- this is the first problem. I don't even really see it as a problem cause we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside, but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just concerned, like if this keeps going, like.;;change8;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;So, it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it, it's like it's all or nothing. Either you keep smoking the way you are, things continue to go downhill and get worse, your wife gets more and more on your case, or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again. It's almost like one or the other. It strikes me that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking.;reflection;8;high;smoking cessation;21;client;So, I can actually do it that way like gradual taber?;;neutral8;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;There are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt. Recognizing that it-it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be.;therapist_input;8;high;smoking cessation;23;client;I wish my wife could have come today cause she's feels after like, just stop like right away. So do you think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message?;;neutral8;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;If you wanted to bring your wife along, I'd be more than happy to talk with both of you.;other;8;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Okay. I'll have to talk to her as well because their schedule changes from week to week, she works shifts, so I'll call you back tomorrow and we'll set something up.;;neutral8;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Okay. That sounds good.;other;8;high;smoking cessation;27;client;All right.;;neutral8;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Thanks for coming in.;other;8;high;smoking cessation;29;client;Okay. Thanks.;;neutral10;low;diabetes management;0;therapist;Hi. You are [unintelligible 00:00:02]?;question;10;low;diabetes management;1;client;Yeah.;;neutral10;low;diabetes management;2;therapist;Okay. Um, what brings you in?;question;10;low;diabetes management;3;client;Well, I'm supposed to come to learn about my-- how to manage my diabetes. Just got diagnosed.;;neutral10;low;diabetes management;4;therapist;Mm-hmm. I see- I see that your A1C or your blood glucose is very high.;therapist_input;10;low;diabetes management;5;client;Yeah, that's what doctor said. She-she really laid into me about that. Said it was-- I guess, this is really serious stuff. She was talking about losing eyesight, mm, my feet, mm, problems with a lot of other stuff, and it really scared me. Uh, so, [sighs] you know, how-how-how to manage all this, I guess, is what I gotta learn, but it just sounds massive.;;neutral10;low;diabetes management;6;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, you do need to take your medicine. We, uh, will need to start dieting, uh, you know, lose some weight, change-change your eating habits, exercise, uh, to get your diabetes under control, because your doctor is right, it is very serious.;therapist_input;10;low;diabetes management;7;client;That's, uh, that's a huge amount of stuff to do and, I'm not- I'm not certain I can do all that, and on top of it, it's-it's-- if I don't get it all done, all this stuff happens to me?;;neutral10;low;diabetes management;8;therapist;So, it sure can.;therapist_input;10;low;diabetes management;9;client;[sighs];;neutral10;low;diabetes management;10;therapist;So, uh, you know, we-we need to start looking at doing all those different things to get your diabetes under control 'cause your-your number is very high.;therapist_input;10;low;diabetes management;11;client;Well, I-I [unintelligible 00:01:35];;neutral11;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;What else has brought you here?;other;11;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;They found a little bag of weed.;;neutral11;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;11;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;It's not a lot though.;;sustain11;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;11;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;It's not like I was gonna sell it or anything. It's like—;;sustain11;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;Just enough for your own use?;question;11;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;Yeah, whatever, you know. It's California, no one cares.;;sustain11;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.;other;11;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;How long is this gonna take?;;neutral11;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;Yeah, we-- You know, we have about 15 to 20 minutes to talk today, total. Um-um, which certainly it's just the first of-of some sessions that we'll have together over the next six months. It'd be a natural question you'd wanna know how much time this will take, of course. Um, what else would you like me to know about you and your perspective that you think will help me work with you over this time?;therapist_input;11;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;I just wanna get whatever I need to get done, done.;;neutral11;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;Okay. You're more focused on what you need to do to get this behind you?;reflection;11;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;Yeah;;neutral11;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;.Okay, mm-hmm. Well, I'm wondering then if it's okay with you and-and I have a form that we can use if you'd like, um, just to put out some different ideas on an agenda that we could share as we're working together so that I-I can support you to be successful in getting this behind you. Would-would this feel like a natural time to-to move towards figuring out where we might go together?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Sarah, I'm so glad you came in for your well-woman exam today. I think we addressed a lot of your concerns. However, I would like to ask you more about your smoking. Would that be okay?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah, I guess.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Okay. So about how much are you smoking over the course of a day? You had said it had increased over once or twice a day.;question;12;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Yeah, um, normally, I'm smoking, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch break and then in the evening maybe like five or six.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay. So about eight cigarettes. So over the course of a day, just under half a pack?;reflection;12;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Yeah.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Okay. And that's changed over what period of time?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Um, honestly, it's probably been over the past year or so that I- I've been smoking a little bit more.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Okay. So over the past year, the smoking has increased. And that's been mainly in the evening?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Yeah. Um, I have a two-year-old son as I mentioned, so I try to never smoke around him. So I'm normally kinda waiting until he gets to bed.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind.;reflection;12;high;smoking cessation;11;therapist;Yeah, exactly. You know, I told you, my-my schedule is kinda crazy right now. I, um, I work full-time and I just started back at night classes. So, you know, all that combined, you know, I enjoy that time to myself in the evening.;other;12;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Sure. Sure. Well, it's a time to relax and you've got a lot going on.;reflection;12;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;So are there other things you do in the evening to relax?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Um, I mean, maybe I'll have like a drink or two.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Okay. A drink or two. So about how many drinks would you say you have over the course of a day?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Um, maybe like two max.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Two max. How many drinks would you say you'd have over the course of a week?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;19;client;I don't know. I mean, I don't really get why you're asking me that. I mean, I just came here, you know, for a regular visit. I-I am not here to talk about my drinking.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;No, I understand- I understand. And I'm certainly not here to tell you what to-to do, Sarah. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and sharing some information with you, and what you do with that information is totally up to you. You've got a lot going on. You're a mother, you're working, you're going to school, and our healthcare team wants to make sure that you have all the resources available to you to meet your goals, including good health. And my job as your healthcare provider is to listen to you and to share information with you, including healthcare concerns associated with smoking and alcohol. Would that be okay with you?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Yeah, I guess.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Okay. Well, we do know that an increase in smoking and alcohol is associated with certain kinds of cancer;;12;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Yeah.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;-interested in what your thoughts are, Sarah.;question;12;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Well, I-I'm just kinda surprised because, I mean, I don't smoke or drink that much. And I mean, compared to people I work with, you know, I-I smoke a lot less, and I feel like I've actually been trying to keep it pretty low.;;sustain12;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;So you're consciously trying to cut back.;reflection;12;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;I have a readiness ruler in my pocket here, 0 means not ready to stop smoking at all and 10 means absolutely ready to stop smoking. Where do you see yourself on that scale?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;29;client;Um, maybe like a five.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;About a five. So you're halfway there. So why did you choose a five rather than a four?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;31;client;Well, I mean, you brought up some kinda scary stuff like, you know, cancer risk or other things like that. And you know, being a mother, I-I don't want something to happen to me obviously.;;change12;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Right. Well, that's a lot of information to think about. So given, the fact that these healthcare concerns are a possibility, and that you're worried about your family and you certainly have goals you want to succeed at, where are you in your consideration to making a change? In other words, what steps would you consider taking for this number to move closer to a 10?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Well, I mean, I could maybe try to cut back in the evenings a little bit.;;change12;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Okay, great. Let's quantify that a little bit. So how many cigarettes would that be?;therapist_input;12;high;smoking cessation;35;client;Well, right now, if I'm having like five or six, I could try to smoke three in the evening plus, you know, still the couple during the day.;;change12;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Okay. So you-- that's cutting back quite a bit. That's a big step. So since we're kind of running out of time here today, I'm wondering if we could-- would be willing to come back in about four weeks to review this plan?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;37;client;Yeah. Sure.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay, good. So we can go over your laboratory results at that time, as well as review your plan. Now, would you like some information on smoking cessation?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Yeah, I-I think that would be very helpful.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Okay. Well, I've got a brochure here and this has-- it's a really good brochure. It has some distraction techniques in it in case you get those nicotine cravings. So it's-;therapist_input;12;high;smoking cessation;41;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;-been helpful, um, in-- with patients before. I'd also like to ask you, would you be willing to see one of our counselors?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;43;client;Well, what-what for exactly?;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Well, Dr. Kirtley is one of our counselors and he is an expert in-- at discussing the association between alcohol and stress. I want to share something with you. The National Guidelines recommend that women have no more than seven drinks of alcohol per week to-to stay at that low risk level, to avoid the healthcare concerns that we spoke of earlier.;therapist_input;12;high;smoking cessation;45;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;You've indicated that your alcohol consumption is a bit higher than that, putting you at risk. So that's why I asked if you'd be willing to talk to Dr. Kirtley.;therapist_input;12;high;smoking cessation;47;client;I mean, I would like to talk about, you know, my stress, but I'm still not sure with the whole drinking thing.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;48;therapist;Certainly, certainly. I'm glad you're willing to talk to him. So before you leave here today, we'll, uh, stop by the scheduler's desk and make an appointment for you to see me back in four weeks, as well as the appointment with Dr. Kirtley. And that way, before you leave, you're all set. So do you have any other questions for me, Sarah?;question;12;high;smoking cessation;49;client;I don't think so.;;neutral12;high;smoking cessation;50;therapist;Okay. Well, it's very nice to meet you. I'll see you in a month.;other;12;high;smoking cessation;51;client;Okay.;;neutral13;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hi, Mrs. Smith. I wanted to let you know that at this appointment, we're gonna be giving Lilly some vaccines.;therapist_input;13;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Oh, I-I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. I've been reading a bunch of stuff lately about them.;;sustain13;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Hmm. Can you tell me more about your concerns about vaccines?;question;13;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Uh, yeah, well, I was just- I was reading that it's better to let them build up their immunity, like, naturally and stuff in their immune systems.;;sustain13;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Okay, so you were thinking that maybe exposing Lily naturally to these diseases would be a better choice than using vaccines to help her get stronger?;reflection;13;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Well, yeah. I mean, I had chickenpox as a kid, and now I'm immune. Right? So.;;sustain13;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;That's right. Having chickenpox as a child means that you are less likely to have chickenpox as an adult because you've developed a-a natural immunity. Uh, but is it okay if I offer you a little bit more information about the other vaccines that we're- we were going to give her Lily today?;question;13;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Uh, okay.;;neutral13;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;Okay. So, uh, before vaccines were developed, often when children had a natural exposure to some of these diseases, they ended up with, uh, sometimes death, disability, measles caused brain damage and, uh, deafness and blindness. Polio caused, uh, paralysis in children. And so, allowing children to have natural exposure to these diseases, sometimes was a little bit of a gamble, it could be dangerous.;therapist_input;13;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Wow, I didn't realize it was so dangerous. I've never heard of polio.;;neutral13;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Hmm. Some of these things I've mentioned to you, you're-you're not familiar with. Uh, and I think that's because we've done such a good job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of people your age, and even my age, are unfamiliar with those things.  Um, so having shared this information with you, what do you think about the idea of vaccines for-for Lilly?;question;13;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;Uh, I guess it's okay. I mean, I just I want her to be healthy and safe.;;change13;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;It's really important for you to make sure that she's protected and that you make good decisions and do your research before you make any medical decisions for her.;reflection;13;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;Yeah, I just want to do what's right.;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;So, again, I hear your overall goal is really, to not give up these things you'd like but to cut back on how much you have-;reflection;14;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Yeah, I guess so.;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;-on that. All right. So, I'd like to ask you, uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause I'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance.;reflection;14;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Yeah.;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;"So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, ""I'm very, very confident,"" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?";question;14;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;Right now, I'm probably-;;neutral14;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;gonna say a six.;;neutral14;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;A six.;reflection;14;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;But I know when I go home and I see the food, it's probably gonna drop back down to a four.;;sustain14;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;Okay. All right. So, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a four.;reflection;14;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;Right?;;neutral14;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Okay?;question;14;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;I guess.;;neutral14;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;So, why are you at a four and not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or a one?;question;14;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Because I've been wanting to do this for-for years, like-;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;Okay.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;ever since I started becoming conscious of my body.;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Okay.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;Like ever since I started being a teen, like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially 'cause all my friends play soccer, and like-;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;-hike, and are like super stick-thin but really healthy and active.;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;Okay.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;And so I'm just sort of like, well, I'm not.;;neutral14;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;Okay.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;But I want to be like-- I don't want to be like stick-thin, but I really want to be like really healthy and really active.;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;Okay.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;And like be able to look nice, you know.;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;Okay, all right.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;I wanna be able to look nice.;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;Okay. So, what would help increase that confidence? What-- Because that sounds like where we really need to focus on. What's gonna help you feel more confident about this?;question;14;high;diet and weight loss management;31;client;I don't even really know-;;neutral14;high;diet and weight loss management;32;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;33;client;-honestly. Like, I mean, I know I'm gonna have to keep like telling myself like-;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;34;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;35;client;-like this is something that you want- that you've wanted-;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;36;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;37;client;for years.;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;38;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;39;client;Like, you can do it. Because like-;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;40;therapist;Okay.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;41;client;I know I can do it. Like I can do anything.;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;42;therapist;All right.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;43;client;I can do anything-;;change14;high;diet and weight loss management;44;therapist;All right.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;45;client;-I know that. But it's hard getting to the point where I-;;sustain14;high;diet and weight loss management;46;therapist;Okay.;other;14;high;diet and weight loss management;47;client;do something.;;sustain14;high;diet and weight loss management;48;therapist;All right. Well, if it's okay, just for a moment, let's put the- let's put the changing the eating pattern off to the side, and let's take a look at some other time in your life that there was something you really wanted to accomplish and you did. And what is it about you- what was it about you? What kind of strengths did you bring to the table that allowed you to tackle something that felt like a challenge and-and allowed you to be successful?;question;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So, Rick, just in regards to your flatmate situation at the moment with Tristan. Uh, you know, we talked about how walking through this program and with the support of your parents and having some positive influence to help you through this. I just want to rethink a bit if you stay living with Tristan. What are the sort of pros and cons of that? What are the good things about living there, what are the not-so-good things about living there?;question;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Oh, it's a nice place. It's close to work. It's good living with a mate.;;neutral16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Yeah. So, in terms of being supportive and a sort of support you're gonna need to make these changes.;therapist_input;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;What's your thinking around that?;question;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;That's the thing, isn't it? I am-- I don't know if it's the best place for me to be if I'm gonna make those changes.;;change16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;And Tristan is a good flatmate.;;sustain16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Yeah.;other;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;I have no-- We're going in different-different directions now. He doesn't have the same kind of responsibilities I have and stuff, and so-- And I can't expect him to change his whole life around, just because I wanna change mine.;;change16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Right.;other;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;I just-- I don't know how keen I am to move in with my- with my aunty and uncle, though.;;neutral16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Okay. You're good to explore, but I just want to ask you about, how much does Chris-Christian-Christian know-- Tristan know about you changing your life? What does he really know about the changes you wanna make?;question;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;I sit down and talk with him, asked him for, um, for support and stuff and he's fully, he says fully he'll be there for me. But, like I said, he's, um, he's in a different place in his life than I am in mine.;;change16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;He doesn't have kids.;;neutral16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Right.;other;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;He doesn't-- I don't know if he can really understand what it means to me. Um, he's a good mate.;;neutral16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Okay. What are some of the pros and cons about moving in with whāna, moving in with your auntie and uncle?;question;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;The food would be good. Um, I get- I get support with-- my whānau is really supportive, but I'm- I'm worried about losing- I'm worried about losing my freedom. I'm worried about, um, about them taking over, or, you know what I mean? I have a freedom where I am now, I'm in charge of myself. That would probably be really good.;;neutral16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;In terms of that freedom and in charge of yourself, and the changes that we're talking about, and building your own family, and to enable you to do that, where do some of that freedom stuff sit with re-engaging back with your whānau and your children, your partner? Is it something you're gonna wanna hang on to, or how you're going to manage that?;question;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;I don't wanna hang on to freedom if it this- if it means that I lose my kids. Um, I'm just, uh, I'm just worried about-- I'm worried about if I move in with family, that they, even if their intentions are good-;;change16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;16;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;I don't know. I'll do anything to get my kids back.;;change19;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;So you're sick of this?;reflection;19;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;Yeah. I-I just-- I can't shoplift anymore. You know, I got- I got caught again. And uh, you know, I-I got suspended, I got back to school, so I'm-I'm uh-- I'm gonna mess up my whole life here, unless I can stop this.;;change19;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;19;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;Yeah, it's bad. My friends and I, we just-- I mean, it's fun and uh-- so I don't know what to do, but I- but I gotta change.;;change19;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;Okay.;other;19;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;I want it.;;change19;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;So, it sounds like you're ready. You're ready to give this up.;reflection;19;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;Yeah.;;change19;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;But, maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear.;reflection;19;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;Right. I don't know what I'm gonna do, I got some friends. These guys are-- they're bad news, but they're my friends.;;sustain19;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;19;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;And, uh, and it's fun.;;sustain19;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;And it's fun.;reflection;19;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;You know?;;neutral19;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;19;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;Nothing-nothing much else going on that's as fun as this. We go in, we steal these CDs. It was working out fine, but—;;sustain19;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;20;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.;therapist_input;20;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Okay.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Um, I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that.;therapist_input;20;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, um, It's just me and him and I do smoke. Um, I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I-I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. But it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and-and my having a full-time job. And so it's just-- that's why I started smoking again.;;sustain20;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.;reflection;20;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Yeah. Some people have a glass of wine. I have a cigarette.;;sustain20;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?;reflection;20;high;smoking cessation;7;client;I know it's not good for him. I mean, I've read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke.;;change20;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?;reflection;20;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Right. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't have asthma. Yeah. He-- I don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have, so. And I've thought about quitting before in the past, but I just don't- I just don't see how it's possible right now.;;sustain20;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?;question;20;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that. And I didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?;reflection;20;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Yeah, exactly.;;sustain20;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;How were you successful when you quit before?;question;20;high;smoking cessation;15;client;I don't know. I-I think about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just- I just did it. You know, I just- I just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;20;high;smoking cessation;17;client;"-and-and him having problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. So I-- that was just enough to-to say, ""Okay, you know what, I'm-I'm not going to risk that."" so.";;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?;reflection;20;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;But they don't feel as scary to you now?;reflection;20;high;smoking cessation;21;client;No, I mean, we're two separate people. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good about that. I-I don't let other people smoke around him. Um, so I, you know.;;change20;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;You're doing the best you can do.;reflection;20;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Yes.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?;reflection;20;high;smoking cessation;25;client;"Yeah. I-I know that I need to, and I, you know, keep every new year I say, ""Okay, this year I'm gonna quit smoking"" but then something happens and it-it just doesn't. And quitting doesn't happen.";;change20;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;It's on your to-do list. It's just not making it to the top?;reflection;20;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?;question;20;high;smoking cessation;29;client;Probably like a 5 . Kind of in the unsure area. Like I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation.;;sustain20;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?;question;20;high;smoking cessation;31;client;I know- I know all the ways it's bad for me. And I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. I don't want him to-to use any kind of-- I don't want him to chew or anything like that. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing, but I just don't know if I can do it.;;change20;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Okay. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit. You have been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it?;reflection;20;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Where do you think we should go from here?;question;20;high;smoking cessation;35;client;I don't know. I-I'd like some help. I just don't know what kind of help I need.;;change20;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Sure. Well, if you'd be interested, that's something I can definitely talk to you about. There are a lot of new options that can actually help people be way more successful in their attempt at quitting. There's different medications you can try.;therapist_input;20;high;smoking cessation;37;client;I don't like medicine.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay. There's also a lot of support groups and classes that you can take where you have other people to go through it with you. And sometimes just having that support can be a big part of it, especially for people like you where smoking is such a stress reliever.;therapist_input;20;high;smoking cessation;39;client;That sounds nice, but I'm not sure if I have the time for all that.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Sure. It feels like something that would take up a lot of time and maybe not fit into your life. I wonder if we could talk about some options that might fit into your life.;question;20;high;smoking cessation;41;client;That would be really nice.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Okay. Well, if you're willing, then we could set up another appointment where you could come in and we could talk more about that.;therapist_input;20;high;smoking cessation;43;client;I would like that. That would be great.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Great.;other;20;high;smoking cessation;45;client;Thank you.;;neutral20;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Sure.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, Laura.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Hi.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Thanks for coming in. Um, so, I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here. If it's okay, I'll give you a little rundown.;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;So, basically, we're here, I'm just gonna talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life, um, get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in. It's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you, you know. Basically, I'm gonna talk to you about how things are going, any changes you might want to make in your life, how I could help you with that, and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you.;therapist_input;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Okay.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Does that sound okay?;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;All right, so, I guess just to get started, can you tell me a little bit about yourself?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Well, my name is Laura. I'm 17 years old, and I'm a senior in high school.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Okay. And, what kinds of things do you plan for your life?;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Well, hopefully, go to college, get, you know, good enough grades to go to college.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Hm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;That's great.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Do you have a plan as to where you might want to go or?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Um, I'm not sure yet. Maybe a few schools in the area, I'm looking maybe to apply out-of-state.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Oh.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;So, maybe move away for college.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Cool.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;So, kind of keeping your options open.;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah, definitely.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Great. And, do you have an idea about what you might want to study or?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Yeah, maybe um, pre-law.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Oh, wow. Okay, that's exciting.;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;All right, cool. Uh, what do you like to do for fun?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Well, um, on the weekends I like to hang out with my friends, maybe go to like a party, or go to the mall to shop, or if there's like a school-related event, we'll go to like a football game or-;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;-something like that, yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;You like to have a good time?;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;And, you have a lot of friends or a few close people, or?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Um, I would say like a moderate amount. I'm not really-really popular or like, I have no friends.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;So, I'm like normal.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;All right.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;That's a good way to be, right?;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah. [chuckles];;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;All right, so, um, it sounds like, in general, your-- Things are going pretty well for you. How are your grades right now?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, they're pretty good, As and Bs. So, I'm doing okay.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Okay.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;Through college.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Um, family definitely, uh, friendship, and belonging.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Okay.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;What's important to you about your family?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Well, I-I love them, so I want them to think well of me-;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Hm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;-and I want them to, um, be accepting and love me.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Okay. Do you have brothers or sisters?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Yeah, I have one sister.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;Okay, great. And, how about friendship?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Friendship, um, I've-I've grown close to many people that I care about. So, I would like them to be accepting of me as well.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Great. So, being a good friend and-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;-having people who are good friends, too, is important. And then, what about belonging? You mentioned that one too.;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yeah, just a sense of like fitting in and not-- And like getting accepted-;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Hm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;-in general, yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Yeah. Wanting to be part of a group-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;-and kinda. Okay, great. All right, well, one of the things I wanna talk about is, you know, um, you mentioned that you'd like to go out with friends and-and party, and that sort of a thing. And, I'm curious, when you're out in the parties, do you ever ha;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Um, not much, maybe like one or two drinks at the most.;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;Um, I pretty much just have a drink to just have it like, so it looks like I'm drinking, even though I'm not.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;Hm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;So maybe people won't bug me about drinking or something.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;Okay, you're kinda getting pressure from other people who are drinking, and it feels easier for you to-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;Yeah just-;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;client;kinda hold a drink.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;have one there and pretending to have it.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;Okay.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;And, do you think that, um, this is most weekends or occasionally? How-;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;Um.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;often do you think that you are around alcohol.;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;Maybe one or two weekends a month at the most?;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Okay.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;Not really much.;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;So, one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol?;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Okay. And what sort of situations are you in?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Well, just I guess, at a party or something, someone's house.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;Or, even if it's not a party, like a small social gathering, maybe there'll be like a few beers around-;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;Hm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;or something.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;So, mainly, just kinda hanging out with friends.;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;Pretty much, yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;Are you ever, um, places where there are parents around or-;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;Um—;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;or mostly just-just with the kids?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;Mostly just with us, but, sometimes I'll go to like a close friend's house and like I'm close to a family as well. So, we'll all just hang out.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;Mm-hmm. And, what about driving?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;Um, like drunk driving?;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;Yeah. Do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Um, definitely not. I've never drunk-driven, and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Okay. So, that's something that you've sort of made a decision about. It sound like you—;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;Yeah, because I know that's extremely dangerous, so.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;Okay. What do you know about how that's dangerous?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;Um, well, alcohol definitely impairs your judgment. So, I mean, driving under the influence of alcohol can lead to like crashes and accidents and things like that, so I'd rather not be in that situation.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;So, you're really are trying to be safe and-and make sure that-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;Yeah.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;108;therapist;-you're not putting yourself-;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;109;client;Yeah, definitely.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;110;therapist;-in those situations? That's great. You know, it's-it's tough to do sometimes, and I really commend you for being able to-to stick with that.;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;111;client;Thank you.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;112;therapist;So, you mentioned, you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two. What do you thinks is the most alcohol you've ever had in-in one day?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;113;client;Not more than two drinks.;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;114;therapist;Okay. So, the-the absolute most-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;115;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;116;therapist;-was two? Okay. And, what kinds of things do you like about alcohol?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;117;client;Um, I've never really been drunk-;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;118;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;119;client;-so, I can't really say that I like that feeling or not, but, it's just like-- I mean, you're just in a good mood.;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;120;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;121;client;So.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;122;therapist;So, it just kind of makes you feel relaxed or?;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;123;client;Yeah, yeah, relaxed.;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;124;therapist;Okay. Uh, anything else?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;125;client;Um, no, not really. Like I said, I don't drink that much-;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;126;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;127;client;So, I-I wouldn't be able to tell you.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;128;therapist;Okay. And, any not-so-good things about alcohol?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;129;client;Um, definitely, yeah. I mean, when I'm at parties and stuff and it's getting a little later, some people, um, that drink-- Like, drank too much, they start throwing up, or they get hurt, or they're really loud and obnoxious, and that's not fun for anybody.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;130;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, you've seen a lot of other kids who-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;131;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;132;therapist;-had some consequences-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;133;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;134;therapist;-and decided that's not for you?;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;135;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;136;therapist;Got it. I-I can understand that. [chuckles] Uh, any other things that you can think of?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;137;client;Um, no, I mean, I've never, you know, been friends with anybody that's gotten into like a serious accident and stuff. It's just-;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;138;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;139;client;-very, like, obnoxious things.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;140;therapist;Okay. Well, so, you know, as someone who's not 21 yet, it is-- Underage drinking is something that's not legal-;therapist_input;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;141;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;142;therapist;-and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life.;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;143;client;Um, I know it's definitely risky, but, I mean, I guess, we still do it. [chuckles];;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;144;therapist;Uh-huh. So, it's kind of something that you're—;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;145;client;It's just there.;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;146;therapist;It's just there? Okay. And, I'm curious, you mentioned, you know, your friends are important to you, and your family's important to you, and, sort of fitting in is important to you. How does alcohol play a role with that?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;147;client;Um, well, definitely not in my family life, because my parents don't really condone-;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;148;therapist;Okay.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;149;client;-alcohol use, but, friendships, I mean, when I'm hanging out with my friends, or we're at a party or something, there's usually alcohol involved.;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;150;therapist;Okay. So, from your family perspective, the drinking is not something that fits very well?;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;151;client;Yeah.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;152;therapist;And with friends, you feel like it's easier to-to hang out with alcohol, or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun, or your friends wouldn't like you as much or?;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;153;client;I guess, I mean, since it's just there.;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;154;therapist;Okay.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;155;client;So-;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;156;therapist;Got it.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;157;client;it ties in with the whole belonging thing.;;sustain21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;158;therapist;Okay. Well, when you think about your drinking and, sort of, looking forward in 5 years or 10 years, how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;159;client;Um, it probably will have a very small role, if any-;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;160;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;161;client;-in my life, considering I have big plans for my future. So.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;162;therapist;Okay. Can you expand on that a little bit more? What do you mean?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;163;client;I mean, I don't think I would be, you know, drinking as much or going to parties as much if I'm studying for school, or in college, or trying to get in law school and things like that.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;164;therapist;Okay, so, the-the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals?;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;165;client;Yeah, definitely.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;166;therapist;Um, so, when you're sort of looking ahead, how often do you think you might be drinking, say, when you get to college?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;167;client;Um, maybe less than I am now. I mean, I don't drink much anyway, so-;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;168;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;169;client;-maybe, like, one drink every once in a blue moon.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;170;therapist;Okay. So, you sort of have a plan to cut back on-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;171;client;Yeah, definitely.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;172;therapist;your drinking eventually?;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;173;client;For sure.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;174;therapist;How might that go?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;175;client;Well, I mean, I guess right now I would try to stop in high school, and once I get older, maybe just like, socially once in a while, but not anything big or anything.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;176;therapist;Yeah, so, you don't feel the need to make any major changes, but you feel like you could make some adjustments that would make it easier or—;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;177;client;Definitely, yeah. That's a good word.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;178;therapist;Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking, on a scale of 1 to 10? Where 1 is not at all important, not something you're thinking about, and 10 is most important thing.;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;179;client;Maybe a five or six.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;180;therapist;And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;181;client;Because, um, it's not something I do not care about at all, but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;182;therapist;Okay. So, it is something you have thought about or something.;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;183;client;Yeah, yeah. Definitely.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;184;therapist;Okay. And, how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;185;client;Um, I'm pretty confident that I can considering that I'm not really an alcohol user per se.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;186;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;187;client;I'm not really into that whole scene, so, it's-it's not gonna bedifficult for me.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;188;therapist;So, what number do you think you'd say?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;189;client;Um, on a scale of 1 to 10-;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;190;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;191;client;if I can quit or not?;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;192;therapist;Yeah.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;193;client;Maybe like an 8 or 9.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;194;therapist;Okay, and why'd you say 8 or 9 rather than even like 5 or 6?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;195;client;Because, like I said, it's not a big part of my life. So, it's not really that difficult;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;196;therapist;Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind, it sounds like, um, you do have sort of a-a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;197;client;Yes.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;198;therapist;-and, it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself, and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it. What sort of goal do you think might be good to set for t;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;199;client;Um, probably to stop, maybe next party I go to, not have a drink at all.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;200;therapist;Okay. Um, do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;201;client;Yeah. I mean, I can just tell my friends-- My pa-- My friends aren't really that pressuring.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;202;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;203;client;It's just like outside people that I don't really know that well.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;204;therapist;Okay.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;205;client;"So, I could just tell them, ""Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.""";;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;206;therapist;What-what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;207;client;Um, definitely, I'll have like all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;208;therapist;Uh-huh. Anything else?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;209;client;Um, health concerns, I guess. I know alcohol is bad for your health.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;210;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;211;client;So, that would be one.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;212;therapist;Okay. So, it's-- It sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore a-at least at the next part? and seeing how it goes.;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;213;client;Yeah.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;214;therapist;Okay. Do you think it would be all right if we met again to kinda check in on how it goes and-and see if it's working out for you?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;215;client;Yeah, that would be okay.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;216;therapist;All right, great. And then, i-it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are, um, health benefits-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;217;client;Yeah.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;218;therapist;-having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals, and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;219;client;Right.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;220;therapist;Okay. Well, very good. Um, is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;221;client;Um, how would you, um, advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;222;therapist;Oh, that's a great question. So, a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back, it's harder if their friends are still drinking, and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol, but-;therapist_input;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;223;client;Okay, yeah.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;224;therapist;-of course, that's harder if you're not the one planning. So, some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, um, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends, um, some of the things th;therapist_input;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;225;client;Oh okay.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;226;therapist;-without any alcohol mixed into it. Um, often, having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol, because you already have something in your hand-;therapist_input;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;227;client;Yeah, that's a good idea.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;228;therapist;-and it-it kinda, um, prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;229;client;Yeah, for sure.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;230;therapist;Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it, have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about, about telling them about your plan to-;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;231;client;I mean-;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;232;therapist;to stop drinking.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;233;client;-I was just planning on telling them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That wasn't me.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;234;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;235;client;So.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;236;therapist;Your friends would be pretty comfortable with that?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;237;client;Yeah. I mean, at least my closest friends, for sure.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;238;therapist;Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else I can help with?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;239;client;No. No, I think I'm okay.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;240;therapist;Okay. So then, like I said, um, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going-;reflection;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;241;client;Okay.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;242;therapist;-and then, um, if things are going great, then fantastic, and if you run into any stumbling blocks, then we can maybe problem-solve together.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;243;client;Okay, great. Thanks.;;neutral21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;244;therapist;That sound okay?;question;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;245;client;Yeah.;;change21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;246;therapist;All right. Thanks so much.;other;21;high;reducing alcohol consumption;247;client;No problem.;;neutral22;high;adhering to family values;0;therapist;You did your values clarification handout, and that was part of what I wanted to go over with you today. I wanted to hear about your values and just talk to you a little bit more about that. Do-do you wanna tell me what some of your top five values are?;question;22;high;adhering to family values;1;client;Yes, um, my top value is family happiness, um, that's-;;neutral22;high;adhering to family values;2;therapist;That's number one?;question;22;high;adhering to family values;3;client;-that's number one to me, especially now. I usually do this values clarification sheet, like, every two to three months-;;neutral22;high;adhering to family values;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;22;high;adhering to family values;5;client;-just to see if anything changed, and every time it has changed.;;neutral22;high;adhering to family values;6;therapist;Oh.

Would you like to talk more about that?;question;22;high;adhering to family values;11;client;Yeah. Um, I can just pretty much say that my family hasn't been on one accord, so, like, if-- I feel like if we all just can fall in the middle, which I know everybody doesn't really follow that track. So, um, I think for my part, 'cause I can't change anybody, is to be more present and, um, just listen and understand my family members, and-and be able to voice what I feel as far as how important family happiness-happiness is to me.;;neutral22;high;adhering to family values;12;therapist;Mm. Because even though it's important to you, maybe they don't know it's important to you.;reflection;22;high;adhering to family values;13;client;Yes.;;neutral22;high;adhering to family values;14;therapist;Is that what you're saying?

And I feel like my faith is still there but it's-- You know, as long as it's still there, that's all that matters.;;neutral22;high;adhering to family values;26;therapist;Right.

Nice to meet you.;other;23;high;managing life;1;client;Hi.;;neutral23;high;managing life;2;therapist;So I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties.;other;23;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah. Um, yeah, I guess it kind of- it kind of started like five, six years ago.;;neutral23;high;managing life;4;therapist;Okay.;other;23;high;managing life;5;client;Um, it kind of escalated a bit. Um, I've just recently moved out, um, from living with my parents. So just made it a bit worse, I think.;;neutral23;high;managing life;6;therapist;Okay. Is this the first time that you've left home?;question;23;high;managing life;7;client;Yeah, I am- Yeah. It's the first time actually, yeah. Um, I was going to a few years ago. I just thought it'd be easier to stay at home, so.;;neutral23;high;managing life;8;therapist;Okay. So it has been quite a big step and a big change and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP.;reflection;23;high;managing life;9;client;Yeah.;;neutral23;high;managing life;10;therapist;So how has that, uh, changed things for you?;question;23;high;managing life;11;client;Um, don't know, it's kind of, I haven't really told anyone, so, I mean, it's made it like better in sense. I feel, hopefully this is, this is it like, it- it'll help, but I don't know. I don't like thinking that I've like have to do this. I never thought I'd like be the kind of person you'd have to actually go and like get help if that makes sense.;;neutral23;high;managing life;12;therapist;Okay. So how do you feel about being here today?;question;23;high;managing life;13;client;It's like scared. I don't know. Hopefully, it will help.;;neutral23;high;managing life;14;therapist;Okay. So you'd, you're feeling a little bit anxious about today.;reflection;23;high;managing life;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral23;high;managing life;16;therapist;Okay. So I guess just going back to why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today. So it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years. Um, but just recently you moved out of home for the first time and, um, and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP. So how did that change things? How were things after you moved out?;reflection;23;high;managing life;17;client;Um, I thought that they'd be better, but 'cause I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and I suppose actually a lot worse. So I'm-I'm just kind of staying in the house a lot. I don't really have any friends or anything. I mean my family come and visit a bit, but it's not-- I don't know. It's kind of scary because I've just been kind of-- that should just end the flight by myself, which I always thought I'd like, but I don't actually like it.;;neutral23;high;managing life;18;therapist;Okay. So what other kinds of difficulties that you have been experiencing?;question;23;high;managing life;19;client;Um, I mean, I'm-I'm a photographer. Um, so I kind of-- It's-it's been stopping me a bit, my anxiety, from being able to get work and because every time, you know, there's, uh, an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people, I just tend to just turn it down. So it was kind of making things hard in that respect and um, just kind of friends wise and everything. I just feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone. So it's kind of stopping me from making friends and, you know, like relationships and stuff.;;neutral23;high;managing life;20;therapist;Okay. So you said that, um, your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things. So they're, they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer, I guess that- that can be kind of a problem. And they're also stopping you or you feel like it's stunting you, uh, socially. You're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people.;reflection;23;high;managing life;21;client;Yeah, yeah. Um, it was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously, I mean, my parents, so it's fine, but you know, they would, I'd go to places with, um, or I'd kind of have people there, but more and more, I'm just finding myself just staying in a lot. I mean-- I went like two weeks ago for coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again. So I don't, I just don't want to-- I don't want that to happen. I don't want to lose everyone. So-;;neutral23;high;managing life;22;therapist;So you're kind of worried about how, where this is going to lead to.;reflection;23;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah. Um, yeah.;;neutral23;high;managing life;24;therapist;So you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in about five or six years ago.;reflection;23;high;managing life;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral23;high;managing life;26;therapist;So you would have been about 19.;reflection;23;high;managing life;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral23;high;managing life;28;therapist;And what was happening around that time?;question;23;high;managing life;29;client;Uh, I guess I'd finished school about a year before that. Um, and I mean, I-I've always been a bit shy, um, at school, but it was never ever, uh, like it didn't really affect the things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years ago, I guess. It just started when I- like my friends went to university, and, I don't know, I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there.I just stop going to parties or I'd just say no to invitations or I don't know, I thought my job would help because I mean, I love it. I've- I really like doing photography, but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on, so, which is my thing, you know, but—;;neutral23;high;managing life;30;therapist;What kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job?;question;23;high;managing life;31;client;I guess when it- I have to kind of be working with other people. Um, I don't like that. It's like when I'm trying to kind of- would do an event or something where there's a lot of people there, not just photographers, but actual, you know, if I'm like taking places with people that I don't know, I just kind of find myself saying, you know, I mean, I want to do them, but just is scary. So I just don't do it.;;neutral23;high;managing life;32;therapist;So I guess, tell me a bit more about what happens then. So let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with, uh, you know, it's going to involve, uh, photography with- with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction. What kind of thoughts go through your head?;question;23;high;managing life;33;client;Um, just, I mean, I get really hot and sweaty, and I don't-- I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid, and I feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking, I just can't do my job. And I'm just an idiot. And I mean, they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and-- I mean, I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else. So that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera 'cause I- then I can just put all my attention on that instead of having to, you know, be with other people.;;neutral23;high;managing life;34;therapist;"Okay. So it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at the point where you get that invitation and you think, ""People will look, people will stare, people will think I'm a weirdo."" So there's quite a lot about what you- what you think other the people will think. And how does that make you feel?";reflection;23;high;managing life;35;client;Um, just makes me feel like an idiot, makes me feel like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anymore. I should just go home and I just-- I think I just don't want to be in that situation. I just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal and I'm just the freak, you can't, like do normal things and—;;neutral23;high;managing life;36;therapist;Okay. Can you give me an example of a-a recent situation? Maybe we can focus on that.;question;23;high;managing life;37;client;Um, like a work situation or just--?;;neutral23;high;managing life;38;therapist;Yeah, time when you were maybe doing a job with some people and you felt the social anxiety, you know, that you're describing, you felt that kick in.;other;23;high;managing life;39;client;Yeah. I was doing a job where it was kind of like a- a Nature issue and I was having to work with a lot of different people. Um, and, um, when they told me about the job, I thought it would be fine. I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers, but there were actually people and, you know, I was taking photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that. And I guess- they asked me to, um—;;neutral23;high;managing life;40;therapist;It's quite interesting. Was that a fashion shoot or something?;question;23;high;managing life;41;client;Yeah. Yeah. It was a fashion thing. I think it was for some kind of-- I'm not sure if it was a campaign or something, but, it was-;;neutral23;high;managing life;42;therapist;Okay.;other;23;high;managing life;43;client;Yeah, it was, yeah, it was really cool, but I find it- found it really hard to try and focus on that 'cause I was so- I was kind of feeling really anxious and—;;neutral23;high;managing life;44;therapist;So it wasn't what you expected?;reflection;23;high;managing life;45;client;No. No.;;neutral23;high;managing life;46;therapist;So how long ago was that?;question;23;high;managing life;47;client;That was two weeks ago.;;neutral23;high;managing life;48;therapist;Okay. So it was quite recent.;reflection;23;high;managing life;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral23;high;managing life;50;therapist;So on that particular day, what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation?;question;23;high;managing life;51;client;I just felt really- just really kind of hot. I couldn't really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out. And I was kind of trying really, really hard to just focus, and just, you know, like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything, but I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like, when they'd say 'action' and they're trying to get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid and I shouldn't have been there and—;;neutral23;high;managing life;52;therapist;I can tell you're getting kind of anxious, even just thinking about that day.;reflection;23;high;managing life;53;client;Yeah.;;neutral23;high;managing life;54;therapist;Okay. So you're describing quite a lot there to me. So you're saying that you, you kind of got hot and sweaty, you said that you- you held the camera.;reflection;23;high;managing life;55;client;Yeah.;;neutral23;high;managing life;56;therapist;W-what was, do you mean you kind of try to hide behind it or?;question;23;high;managing life;57;client;I was just trying to focus on it. I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly, it would just-- I don't know. I'd kind of just be able to just get through it and just focus.;;neutral23;high;managing life;58;therapist;So you're holding the camera very tightly.;reflection;23;high;managing life;59;client;Yeah.;;neutral23;high;managing life;60;therapist;W-why was that? Why was that helpful?;question;23;high;managing life;61;client;Cause I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just thought, at least if I can just-- I don't know. It sounds weird, but I was just trying to keep my hands still on it. 'Cause my hands were kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads, like, and I could just tell everyone was looking and they could see, and I just thought if I just managed to hold onto it, it wouldn't be as noticeable, but—;;neutral23;high;managing life;62;therapist;Okay. So, okay. So it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head. Um, you said that you're worried that everyone's looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind?;reflection;23;high;managing life;63;client;Just-- I was just, just stupid and it was just really-- just felt really like kind of- like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I-- Like- I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just, they could tell. And then just thinking of what was she doing?;;neutral23;high;managing life;64;therapist;They could tell what—;question;23;high;managing life;65;client;I was just really like sweaty and just—;;neutral23;high;managing life;66;therapist;Oh, it was all-all that they could see that-that was-;reflection;23;high;managing life;67;client;Yeah.;;neutral23;high;managing life;68;therapist;Okay.;other;23;high;managing life;69;client;Yeah, um, I was trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers, so they can't tell but, I mean, my hands, like, they were so shaken. I was really red and just was-- Just wishing that I just wasn't there.;;neutral23;high;managing life;70;therapist;So, I mean, you've already described it to me a little bit, but if you think about how you looked that day, how'd-how'd you say, how'd you think you looked?;question;23;high;managing life;71;client;I think just very stupid and, like, I think my face was really red. I could feel it flushing and I knew that I'd- I was probably sweating and shaking, like my hands were definitely really really shaking. Um, and af-- it was, like definitely really noticeable. Everyone could definitely see.;;neutral23;high;managing life;72;therapist;Okay and what-what did you do about-- How did you try and conceal that or hide that?;question;23;high;managing life;73;client;Um, well, I again was trying to grip the camera, just look down, just trying not to do anything weird or-- 'Cause, I mean, they could probably tell I was being weird anyway, but hopefully if-- I just- I just tried really hard to just focus and look down, not trying, like not kind-- look at anyone else and just, yeah, just kind of trying get on with it as best as I could, but—;;neutral23;high;managing life;74;therapist;So you avoided looking at people. It sounds like you wore black as well in kind of preparation anyway.;reflection;23;high;managing life;75;client;Yeah, no, I-I always do that even if it's really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just 'cause otherwise I- I'll just be really sweaty and like, people would definitely be able to see, so.;;neutral23;high;managing life;76;therapist;Okay and how did it end?;question;23;high;managing life;77;client;Um, well, it kind of went on for like an hour or so, and then, um, people were going, um, just a-after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that we've done it. I'd just- I went home straight away, just got on my car and went home. I just didn't want to be around them especially after they would've seen me being weird and I just wanted to get-get home straight away.;;neutral23;high;managing life;78;therapist;Okay.;other;24;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hey, can I help you?;question;24;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah, I hope so. Um, my workplace has just gone smoke-free. I-I'm not-not very happy about it. I'm gonna keep smoking, but I was wondering if there's anything that-that can help me like get through the day. It's like, you know, go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work.;;sustain24;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;So your workplaces went smoke-free and you're not too pleased, huh?;reflection;24;high;smoking cessation;3;client;No. I'm not gonna quit smoking. I mean, I like it. It helps me relax. So, I mean, I don't see what the big deal is.;;sustain24;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay. Tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day. It'll help with the—;question;24;high;smoking cessation;5;client;I mean, I smoke a little less than a pack a day. It's not too bad. Um, I've probably smoked for the last five years, but I-I-I mean, could quit if I wanted to, but I don't really want to right now.;;sustain24;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Okay. So you feel like, right now, smoking's a pretty important part of your life. It's not something you're ready to change, but if the time came when you did decide to quit, you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that.;reflection;24;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Sure. I can quit.;;change24;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Okay. What makes you so confident?;question;24;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Well, I mean, I don't see why I couldn't, I-- although I have not ever tried to quit, it's just something that I do for fun, you know, on breaks at work, in the morning, and after work.;;sustain24;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. And so in terms of, uh, uh, readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt, where do you think you fall on the scale of 1 to 10, where one is, I'm not considering it at all, and 10 is, I'm definitely ready, I wanna quit.;question;24;high;smoking cessation;11;client;I am probably a two. I-I haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today, I- I'm totally not gonna quit smoking.;;sustain24;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Okay. What made you say two instead of one?;question;24;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, I mean, anything's possible. I mean, I-I guess I could maybe be convinced. Yeah. Is there some-- I mean, are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking?;;change24;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Well, there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke. We have products that can help to replace nicotine, which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke.;therapist_input;24;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Okay. Well, that’s good information. I mean, I'm not gonna do anything today. I just need to know my options, but that's encouraging. If I decided to quit smoking, I-I do have at least tools to help me.;;sustain24;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Sure. And back to that scale, you mentioned, you said you were a two. What do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five?;question;24;high;smoking cessation;17;client;I don't know. I guess if my friends, like if one of my friends decided to like quit with me, that would probably help too, but I-- all my friends love to smoke, so I don't see that happening in the near future.;;sustain24;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Sure. I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free, if there will be some people at work who planning to quit.;question;24;high;smoking cessation;19;client;That's a good point. I hadn't really thought about that. That-that's a good idea. Yeah.;;change24;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Okay. Well, it sounds like you're really here just for information today. I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you.;therapist_input;24;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Okay. Well, thanks a lot.;;neutral25;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;So, Liz, what's something that you'd like to change or maybe that you're feeling two ways about right now?;question;25;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Um, I really want to start working out again. Definitely wanna get back in it, have a routine, and just be healthy.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;Okay, and-and why would you want to make this change?;question;25;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Um, I'm sick of feeling the way I do. I feel kinda sluggish. Especially with the winter coming, I think I want to have more energy.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;25;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;Um, I don't like the way my clothes fit or don't fit me.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;25;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;Just, I don't feel comfortable.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Yeah. So, you're not feeling comfortable with the way that, you said, your clothes fit.;reflection;25;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral25;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;What are some of the reasons why, um, it would be good for you to kinda make this change?;question;25;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;Um, I know exercise is-- in the past, has always made me feel good. I felt good about myself, and just in general, exercise, I know, makes me feel good. I want to be a good example for my kids. I want them to feel like that's a part of life-;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;25;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;-exercising. So, I want-- I really just want to go get back in a routine.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;So, to heal-- feel healthy for yourself as well be a good role model for your kids?;reflection;25;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral25;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;So, if you did decide to get exercising more into your daily routine, how would you go about doing it?;question;25;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;Um, I don't know. I'd probably have to sit down maybe with my husband and try to figure out a good time for me to be able to do that, where he'd be home with the kids and I'd be going to do that, whether it's morning-time, evening, maybe the weekends.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;25;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;Just to find the time to be able to do it, or what works in our schedule.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;So, it's that balance of doing something for yourself, but it sounds like you don't want that schedule to affect too much into your family routine.;reflection;25;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;Right, yeah.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not important and 10 being very important, where would you rate yourself on how important it is to start exercising more?;question;25;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;Mm, I would like to say a seven or an eight, that that's how important it is to me.;;neutral25;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;Okay, and how come not at like a five or a six?;question;25;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;Because I'm really sick of being overweight.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;25;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;Not ha-- I just don't like being unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel good, so I'm motivated to change, it's just getting there.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;So, to summarize, it's important for you to do this. You're starting to feel sluggish, you're not feeling healthy, and you know that you've got other people in your family watching you, and you want to be a good role model for them to know that this is gonna be just a part of your life, is your exercise. Yet for you, you're struggling just a little with the logistics of when to schedule time for you so it doesn't interfere too much with your family.;reflection;25;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;Exactly, yeah.;;neutral25;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;So, knowing this, what do you think you'll do next?;question;25;high;diet and weight loss management;31;client;Mm, I'll probably, I don't know, find-- Now, while it's still somewhat okay outside, maybe pick days I'm gonna go for walks or runs, um, maybe look for a gym close to the house so that I know I can go there quickly or maybe that has daycare, um, yeah, maybe I'll just start to look for that, and find ways I can do it first.;;change25;high;diet and weight loss management;32;therapist;That's great. It sounds like you've got some options and leads on how- on how to get that done.;reflection;25;high;diet and weight loss management;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral26;high;compliance with rules;0;therapist;So what's been going on?;question;26;high;compliance with rules;1;client;I just want my call, that's it.;;neutral26;high;compliance with rules;2;therapist;All right. yeah, I was told that you're phone calls was taken away;reflection;26;high;compliance with rules;3;client;[scoffs] Yeah.;;neutral26;high;compliance with rules;4;therapist;What-what happened?;question;26;high;compliance with rules;5;client;I don't know. Some of-- One of the officers, it's like he has it out for me or something. I don't- I don't know what it is. Something about me not making my bed, something about my attitude. I don't know, I just want my call, man.;;neutral26;high;compliance with rules;6;therapist;Okay. yeah, it was weird when I, uh, got that report because for the most part since you've been here, uh, you'd been like, uh, model-model resident, uh, always making their bed, uh, been pretty, uh, respectful of the staff, of all the other residents. So, uh, is it something to do with you getting out in three weeks? It must be pretty hard.;reflection;26;high;compliance with rules;7;client;I just wanna contact my mom, that's it.;;neutral26;high;compliance with rules;8;therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah, you used to have contact with your mom, you know, almost every other night and now for just about a week, you haven't even gotten to talk to her. I can imagine that being pretty difficult. I remember you saying something about like your dad's birthday coming up?;reflection;26;high;compliance with rules;9;client;My dad's birthday is tomorrow.;;neutral26;high;compliance with rules;10;therapist;Okay.;other;26;high;compliance with rules;11;client;And I just wanted my call so I can talk to my mom. That's it.;;neutral26;high;compliance with rules;12;therapist;Like I said, it's been, um, a long time and this is basically the first time that we've seen this behavior from you, so I know for a lot of other guys right before they get out, uh, a lot of anxiety, a lot of frustration comes around because they haven't been out in a while and then like the pressures of being on the outside are starting to settle in. So is that something might be going on with you?;reflection;27;low;asthma management;0;therapist;I understand that your asthma symptoms have been just really out of control. So, we need to look at some of the ways that you can get healthy and not be back here again.;therapist_input;27;low;asthma management;1;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, I de-I definitely don't wanna come back here. But, uh, the doc said Oscar, my dog, is connected to my asthma symptoms. But the-;;neutral27;low;asthma management;2;therapist;Yeah.;other;27;low;asthma management;3;client;-ridiculous part is I've had him for 12 years before, and now it's a problem.;;neutral27;low;asthma management;4;therapist;Well, you sound a bit surprised by that. But I'm sure that you've seen some of the material that-that the clinic gave you about asthma symptoms and managing your asthma, and pets are a really big source of problems in that respect.;therapist_input;27;low;asthma management;5;client;Yeah, but I-- Um, let me just clarify, I've seen the materials, I have them-;;neutral27;low;asthma management;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;27;low;asthma management;7;client;-I have even read them. All I've been doing is taking the medicine. So, I don't know that much about this.;;neutral27;low;asthma management;8;therapist;Well, uh, wait a second, Sal, what do you mean you-you- ha- If you-- As in-- You know to be informed about-- I'm just really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby-;other;27;low;asthma management;9;client;Yeah.;;neutral27;low;asthma management;10;therapist;a new baby.;other;27;low;asthma management;11;client;John Carlo, yeah.;;neutral27;low;asthma management;12;therapist;-and you are very concerned about your health, you wanna be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps, you've-you've almost quit smoking-;reflection;27;low;asthma management;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral27;low;asthma management;14;therapist;-which is fantastic. So, the next step is to really deal with the dog, deal with the pet. I know it's- so- It's gonna be hard to do that. But there are always people who will adopt animals. I'm sure that you have friends or family members.;therapist_input;27;low;asthma management;15;client;Uh, this is a little too much for me now. First of all, John Carlo is taken care of. That's fine. He doesn't have- no asthma from the dog. It's just me. I don't ha—;;sustain27;low;asthma management;16;therapist;It's you that I'm worried about, Sal. It's you that I'm worried about, okay? The-the symptoms are worse. You've had two or three major asthma attacks. And-and do you appreciate how-- This is, uh, a risk to your life that there are some-some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms? It-it truly is something to take very, very seriously. I can't emphasize that enough.;therapist_input;27;low;asthma management;17;client;"So, Oscar is gonna make me die? He hasn't made me die in 12 years, and the doctor is saying, ""Oh, I don't know if it's the stress, the finances, the drinking."" So, what are we doing saying Oscar could make me die? I've had him for 12 years.";;sustain27;low;asthma management;18;therapist;Sal, what, uh, do you understand that what happened 6 years ago or 10 years ago, your asthma is progressively getting worse. You know very well that the puffers, the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher, and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone. You know this.;therapist_input;27;low;asthma management;19;client;Well, they can keep giving me more medicine and give me the strongest one, and I'll keep Oscar.;;sustain27;low;asthma management;20;therapist;Sal, you're almost on the strongest one.

Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;-drinking and your friends are-;other;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;"Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that.";;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Okay. So, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?;question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;"So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.";reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?;question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;"Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is bad.";;sustain34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.;question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?;question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Um, I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before.;;sustain34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.;;sustain34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Yeah, suburbs. Yeah.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;So, you don't wanna be that- that- that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah, I-I guess. Like, I don't wanna- I don't wanna lose my friends because of this. And I don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, they're good people. They're just—;;sustain34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;You care about them.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure—;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;I don’t want that.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;You don't want that.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;No.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;You want this baby.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Yeah.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Like, I wanna- I wanna be responsible for this thing.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;You don't wanna let your baby down.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;No.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;"And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you're thinking, ""I don't have a choice. I've got to look this way."" Is that kind of what it feels like?";reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;I guess so. I feel like I've already made a choice and already made some bad choices with this.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Nina, I'm wondering, what's your hope for the future? When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?;question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Well, I-I kept the kid because I wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? Like I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And having that push to be a real person is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I-I want to raise this kid well. I don't wanna- I don't wanna let my kid down. I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because I think it's the right time, but I don't wanna- I don't wanna make mistakes that make me realize maybe I'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like I'm not ready for this.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;"You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, ""This baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan B,"" and you guys both get to decide what plan B is gonna look like.";reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah, I just guess it's easier said than done though. Like, it's, like, great, I can make all these changes and I can be a completely new person, but it's, like, at the end of the day, I'm still just who I am.;;sustain34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;"While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live.";reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Yeah. And I'm just- you know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person.;;sustain34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;"While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"" And then this other part of you that says, ""Why not? It's here and I wanna go for it.""";reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yeah, I guess that voice is just a little more stifled by the other one.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Mm-hmm. You got a lot of people around you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking you back to the old life. And the baby is a constant reminder that there’s this new life ahead.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Yeah, it's gonna be very different when it actually comes.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;When you think about, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with the drinking and the life that you were in-in path A?;question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;I think I'm gonna have to be successful. I don't really- I don't have any other choice. Like I have to- I have to take that path.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;"Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel like you need that?";question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Because I need to for my kid. It's- it's gonna be all screwed up if I don't.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;"This part of you that says, ""I don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?";question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;"I don't know, like, maybe- maybe actually talking to my friends and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid and go, ""Of course, of course, your- your choice makes sense. You--"" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if They actually, like, see it.";;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;So you're thinking that, um, once your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?;question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;Or at least they'll feel less pressure to be who they want me to be.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;Mm, kind of feel like you're pulled between two worlds there.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;A little bit.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;"It's not easy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life too. Who can support you, do you think when-when you look around who's in your circle right now, who do you think can support you in moving towards path B?";question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;Definitely my parents, um, and I probably need to, uh, go and meet some other-other people who are maybe, you know, having kids too so that I can see, like how it's done 'cause like, I only have a younger brother who's like not-not even close to that. So I don't really have anyone in my life that I know that's had kids recently. So I-I would like to meet other, you know, young moms out there who, you know, are kind of struggling with the same stuff I am.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;And your parents are a support for you and support you from giving up the drinking, the alcohol use, that's something that they would support-;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;I don't think they realize, uh, that I'm doing it or how much I'm doing it.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;Okay.;other;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;And I know that if they found out, they would be really pissed.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;That would be a concern for them as well as for you now.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;Yeah.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Yeah. Is that something that, um, maybe you and I could meet again about-and talk about having those conversations with-with the family, maybe having conversations about, you know, the folks, your-your friends that are currently in the lifestyle that you were involved with, um, and then sort of what it would look like to go down path B, is that something that you would be open to meeting with me about again?;question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;I think so, yeah, like the telling my parents and [unintelligible 00:13:45] this to my parents is probably the scariest thing.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;And having to talk to those friends, like right now I don't want to do that. It's- it puts them in a weird place.;;sustain34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Kind of feels like you're climbing Mt. Everest.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Yeah.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;And you don't have equipment.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;It feels like I have to lec- I don't wanna have to lecture them and I don't want it to be like a lecture.;;sustain34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;You're concerned that they're gonna kind of treat you like a child.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;My parents or my friends?;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;Oh, oh, you're talking about your friends.;other;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;Yeah, lecture my-- Yeah.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;You're wondering if they're gonna kind of be like children and you're gonna be like the parent saying-;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;Yeah, and I don't wanna be like that.;;sustain34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;You just wanna be like peers talking.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;Yeah.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;And you want them to support you.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.;other;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Yeah, like if there's a- if there's a balance between maybe not the paths, but the worlds, if there's a balance between that-;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Mm. You kind of wanna have the best of both worlds.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;Yeah.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;I want the friends and the relationship that I get from my friends, and at the same time, I don't want the party scene that goes with that.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;Yeah, like I-I know I just can't cut off my friends altogether.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;Well, Nina, you know yourself best, and you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and what those, you know, like, you know the support that your friends give you and the support that you get from your family, you know that. And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices and have those conversations, and I wanna do whatever I can to support you with that. Um, and I'm just wondering if maybe we can kind of pick this up, um, in a next visit, but before we go there, I'm just wondering, is there some steps that you would be willing to kind of take or consider, uh, with-with regards to your drinking?;question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;Um yeah, like I'm so close anyways, that I know I need to now. Um, and I just also, like, have I completely screwed this up, like, is it already too late?;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;108;therapist;You're concerned about the health of your baby. I just would love to share with you, Nina, that every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby, and you know, starting today to have zero alcohol is a great start, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of something you'd be open to as no more alcohol at this point.;therapist_input;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;109;client;Mm-hmm, I have to do.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;110;therapist;Okay, sounds like this is really important to you. You want to make this happen.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;111;client;Yeah.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;112;therapist;Is there anything that I can support you with before we wrap up as far as giving up alcohol today?;question;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;113;client;I don't think so. I think just knowing that it's not too late already is enough kick in the pants to get started.;;change34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;114;therapist;You kind of got a reality check today.;reflection;34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;115;client;A little bit.;;neutral34;high;reducing alcohol consumption;116;therapist;You did really well talking with me today, and I thank you so much for just sharing your heart.;other;35;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;Hi, Natalie. I'm Dawn.;therapist_input;35;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Hi, Dawn. Nice to meet you.;;neutral35;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;Nice to meet you, too. Thanks for coming in today.;other;35;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Thanks for having me.;;neutral35;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;Yeah. Tell me a little bit about yourself.;question;35;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;So I am, um, 28. And I moved out to Arizona about six months ago. Um, I really enjoy spending time with my family and hanging out with friends whenever I can. Work keeps me pretty busy. Um, But I'm really, um, looking to kind of make some changes to my diet and physical activity. I'm not really happy with where my weight's at right now, and, uh, so I thought it'd be good to come and talk with you about some of that stuff.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;Yeah, you're feeling a little bit dissatisfied with your health patterns?;reflection;35;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;Yeah. Um, I'm really starting to notice how I feel more sluggish and just not-- My mood is shifted a lot too, which at first, I thought was because it's getting colder outside, um, but I do also think it maybe has some relation to my activity, or lack thereof, and also kind of the foods that I'm eating.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Okay, so you're feeling some low energy and you know, in the past, when you've been more active and eating differently, you've had more energy?;reflection;35;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;Right. Yeah. Especially during times when I'm more active is when I noticed the biggest cha-change in energy and mood.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;Yeah. Tell me more about that, those previous times that you've been active.;question;35;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;Yeah. Um, well, I played sports in college, so that kept me pretty busy, and that was really fun, um, and I just think back now to, as much that I would cram into a 24 -hour period, and like, wonder how I did that, but I think that part of it was because I was so active physically, um, I just had way more energy throughout the day, mentally and physically to, um, you know, go to school full-time and-and still socialize with friends and do all that stuff. Um, so when I think back to like, probably like the peak of my life of when I felt my best physically, mentally it was that time.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;You had energy, and you were like the Energizer Bunny, just keep going and going and going.;reflection;35;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;Yeah, yeah, exactly. And now it's not so much the same. Um, like when I get home from work, I'm pretty exhausted, uh, it takes a lot for me to want to be physically active when I've spent all day staring at a computer and thinking and working. And so, um, yeah, that's probably been my biggest, uh, issue is like when work ends, going home and not really doing anything. Um, just trying to like unwind by watching Netflix or something else, right?;;neutral35;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;So your days are just as full now that you're working and a career person, um, and your energy level isn't what it used to be. What-- Do you have any ideas about why that might have shifted?;question;35;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Um, well, I think part of it is that when I was in college, it wasn't really an option to go, like, I had to go to practice or I had to do those things because that was, in a sense, my job that was paying for school, um, and now there's not that same commitment to other people or to scholarship money. So that definitely has shifted, um, but I-I do feel like a-an urgency to go it just doesn't seem that like the step that's missing is for me to actually go to a gym or somewhere to be more active. Like, I think I want to it's just the doing it that seems to not happen.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;Right. So in the past, it wasn't up to you whether you had the choice to go be physically active. Now it is up to you, and-and you're looking back at the last few years and saying, I wanna do things differently.;reflection;35;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral35;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;I want to be more physically active than I've been.;reflection;35;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;Yeah, yeah, I think so. Um, that's not to say like, I wanna go run a marathon but I do think that it would help me a lot in terms of just having a better outlook on life, um, and better energy to- if I were to pick up some type of activity.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;Great. And you've noticed a mood enhancement effect of exercise.;reflection;35;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral35;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;Tell me more about that. What do you notice specifically about your mood on the days you're physically active?;question;35;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;Just, I'm-I'm just happier and more upbeat and I think that even my outlook is more positive. So like, if I'm sitting in traffic, and I haven't been physically active, I'll probably grumble about it but if I'm sitting in traffic, and I have been, it's like, I just have a different outlook on things and I already feel like I've gotten something accomplished that day. So it just kind of like helps with that ripple effect into my day of like getting more things done.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;Yeah, you feel more accomplished and-and you feel less irritated by the small stuff.;reflection;35;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;Great. Well, let me see if I've got this all. You came to Arizona six months ago, you're trying to figure out new rhythms and patterns for yourself. You're looking back at the past few years, and in college, you were real active because you were an athlete, and now it's more up to you about making that choice of physical activity, and you're discovering that, um, not being active has affected your energy level and your mood, and that's something you're looking for more of, both of those things, energy and-and a mood booster.;reflection;35;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;Yeah. And then also to, um, like I mentioned, I'm not totally happy with my weight, um, and so hoping too that that would have some impact there and-and maybe help me, um, if my activity kind of gets resolved or improves, then my nutrition also, maybe would go along with it and get better.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;Yeah. Tell me more about your weight concerns. When did you start feeling dissatisfied with your body?;question;35;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;Uh, probably about three, four months ago. Um, yeah, just my clothes started fitting tighter, which wasn't as comfortable, and, um, yeah, just not really super happy with my appearance, which has never really been an issue, um, in my life up until now. I've usually been pretty okay with that, and then in the last three months, I just feel, um, like I've had a lot more of a negative outlook on it.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay, so it sounds like a sort of a vicious cycle and-and maybe the lacking physical activity has made you feel less confident in yourself. I wonder if that's also a piece of this puzzle since you mentioned that's been a big difference from what was happening in the past.;reflection;35;high;diet and weight loss management;31;client;Yeah, I think- I think the activity piece and then also to like, the foods that I'm eating, I don't think are that great. So that also kind of does the same thing, I think, to my appearance or the way that I viewed myself.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;32;therapist;Okay. So you had a pretty strong self-confidence, pretty strong body image all the way up until a few months ago and, um, you're hoping to kind of get back to that place where you feel good about yourself.;reflection;35;high;diet and weight loss management;33;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;change35;high;diet and weight loss management;34;therapist;Great.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;0;therapist;Barbara Roberts?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;1;client;Yes. Morning.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;2;therapist;Hello, there.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;3;client;Hello.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;4;therapist;My name's Dr. Betty. I'm one of the new GPs in the practice. First of all, what would you like me to call you?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;5;client;Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. Thank you.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;6;therapist;Okay, that's fine. Okay. So, Barbara, I'm seeing you today, um, but I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you, is that right?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;7;client;Yes, Dr. Brown is my doctor.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;8;therapist;Okay. What is it that's brought you to see me today?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;9;client;Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach and, uh, Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. And I thought perhaps, uh, I'd come and see you to see if you could help.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;10;therapist;All right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;11;client;Um, well, I-I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. Um, it very often feels bloated. I, um, uh, I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. Um, I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes, and other times it stabs. It's a real stabbing feeling. Um, I often have the urge to go to the toilet and, um, and I pass very smelly wind.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;12;therapist;All right. So, quite a few symptoms there-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;13;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;14;therapist;- and some of them sound-;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;15;client;Yes.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;16;therapist; quite troublesome to you.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;17;client;Yes.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;18;therapist;Okay. And how long has this been going on?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;19;client;Well, I, uh, I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had, um, a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea, and, uh, and I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;20;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;21;client;Yes. Yes.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;22;therapist;Okay. And what's- what sorts of treatments have you tried for-for this before?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;23;client;Well, uh, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;25;client;Um, but I've been to the health shop and-and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different, um, tablets and medicines-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;26;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;27;client;- for different things. Um, no, oh, and Immodium.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;28;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;29;client;I have Immodium in my handbag all the time, just in case. Yeah.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;30;therapist;Right. So, these different tablets that you've got from the-;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;31;client;Hmm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;32;therapist;- the herbal shop-;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;33;client;Hmm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;34;therapist; how are you taking them?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;35;client;Oh, well, different tablets, you know, I don't have the same problem every day-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;36;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;37;client;- so I'll take some tablets for certain, uh, symptoms, and-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;38;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;39;client; other tablets for other things.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;40;therapist;So, am I- am I right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;41;client;Hmm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;42;therapist;- what you're gonna take-;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;43;client;Hmm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;44;therapist;- depending on what your stomach's doing?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;45;client;Yeah.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;46;therapist;Okay. Okay. And what about tests? Have you had any tests for these problems?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;47;client;Yes, uh, I had, uh, in the early days, I had a gastros-gas-- What are they called?;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;48;therapist;A gastroscopy.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;49;client;That's it. Yes.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;50;therapist;You got the tube down-down from the top?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;51;client;Yes. Yeah.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;52;therapist;Okay.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;53;client;Um, and at the same time I had a barium enema.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;54;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;55;client;That was very uncomfortable.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;56;therapist;Okay.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;57;client;Um, but, um, no, I've tried-- Well, you-- I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;58;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;59;client;-and he-he's-he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;60;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;61;client;- as far as he's concerned. Sent me back to the doctor.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;62;therapist;Right. It sounds as though you're-you're not happy with that.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;63;client;Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money, aren't they? And he's-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;64;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;65;client;- decided that I've had enough tests.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;66;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;67;client;And, um, you know, if you go on the Internet-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;68;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;69;client;- there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;70;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;71;client;Um, if I had a bit more money, I'd go private.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;72;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;73;client;I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;74;therapist;Right. So you feel as though actually, enough hasn't been done in the way of-of tests?;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;75;client;No, he's not. There's loads more he could do. I'm sure.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;76;therapist;Right. Okay. It sounds like you-you've had these problems now for about four years.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;77;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;78;therapist;You've-you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;79;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;80;therapist;Um, you've tried a lot of tablets. Some prescribed, some herbal remedies-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;81;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;82;therapist;- and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that-that you haven't been investigated thoroughly enough.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;83;client;Yeah.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;84;therapist;Is that- is that about-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;85;client;I'd say so, yes.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;86;therapist; if I got the story right.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;87;client;Yes.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;88;therapist;Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how-how is all of this affecting you day-to-day? How's-how's it affecting your life?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;89;client;Uh, well, it's had quite-quite a big impact. Um, I mean, the first thing, the biggest thing, I suppose, is that I-I went from being full-time to part-time at work.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;90;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;91;client;I just couldn't sit all day comfortably.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;92;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;93;client;Um, and so I went part-time, but in the end, I, uh, about a year ago, I stopped work altogether.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;94;therapist;Right. Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;95;client;Um, I miss that.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;96;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;97;client;I miss the girls. We used to, uh, we used to go out at least once a week.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;98;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;99;client;To the pictures or for a drink. That's one thing.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;100;therapist;Sounds as though that's something you quite enjoyed.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;101;client;Yeah, so I-- Yes. Yes, we used to have a laugh.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;102;therapist;Right. Okay.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;103;client;Um, I used to go to Swing and Shape. I used to go to an exercise class-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;104;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;105;client;- that was, um, I miss the exercise, actually. That was, um, once a week, but you know, the thing was I wasn't comfortable, never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was gonna be taken short or-- So I stopped that.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;106;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;107;client;Um, then-- Well, my husband and I used to go out for meals.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;108;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;109;client;That's another thing we don't do anymore now.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;110;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;111;client;Um, mm. Yeah, it's quite a few things, really.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;112;therapist;Yeah, it does- it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;113;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;114;therapist; quite a lot because of these symptoms.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;115;client;Yes.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;116;therapist;It sounds- it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;117;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;118;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;119;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;120;therapist;So, what is it you'd spend your average day doing now?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;121;client;Well, I potter around the house-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;122;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;123;client;- um, I spend perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;124;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;125;client;Um, they draw you in, don't they?;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;126;therapist;They certainly do.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;127;client;Um, I read a bit-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;128;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;129;client;- the old magazines, but, uh, generally, I'm at home.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;130;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;131;client;Yeah.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;132;therapist;Okay. Okay. And have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms? For example, have there been any times when things have been better for you?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;133;client;Um, well, last year, um, my son got married-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;134;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;135;client;- and I-I have to say I was worried that, um, that I wouldn't be able to cope with it.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;136;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;137;client;That I-I wouldn't be feeling well enough, but surprisingly enough, um, I was in good form, and I think it was about three weeks in the summer, getting ready for it-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;138;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;139;client; and the whole hoo-ha of the wedding.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;140;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;141;client;But I was in good- in really good form for that. Yeah.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;142;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;143;client;That was a good time.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;144;therapist;Right. And how were you tummy symptoms then?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;145;client;I hardly noticed them.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;146;therapist;Right. Okay.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;147;client;Yeah, it, uh, it seemed to, uh, clear up.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;148;therapist;Right. Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;149;client;Which was good.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;150;therapist;Right. That's interesting.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;151;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;152;therapist;And are there any times when your-your tummy symptoms bother you more? Seem particularly bad?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;153;client;Um, well, it's- I'm-I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;154;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;155;client;It's particularly, um, uncomfortable. Um, I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;156;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;157;client;- he travels with his job, and he-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;158;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;159;client; can be away a couple of times a month.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;160;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;161;client;Um, and that's not-- It-it's very often not good then, I have to say.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;162;therapist;Right. So you notice it's a bit worse when your husband's not around? Okay.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;163;client;Mm. Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more, I don't know, when he's not there.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;164;therapist;Right. I know you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;165;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;166;therapist;What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;167;client;Well, he's-he thinks it's all in my head.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;168;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;169;client;You know, he's- he says it's stress.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;170;therapist;Right. Okay.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;171;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;172;therapist;And what do you think?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;173;client;Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I get too much physical pain-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;174;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;175;client;- for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's-it's real pain.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;176;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;177;client;Um—;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;178;therapist;And have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;179;client;Well, I mean, I-I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;180;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;181;client;- in the early stages, but, um, I think, um, I-I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS. A friend of mines has got that and it sounds similar, and then-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;182;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;183;client;"- other times I'll think, ""I wonder if it's an ulcer.""";;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;184;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;185;client;Um, on a really bad day, I start to think it might be cancer.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;186;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;187;client;Um, my mother-in-law- my mother-in-law died of cancer last year and she had a, um, a growth that-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;188;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;189;client;- the-the doctor didn't investigate.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;190;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;191;client;But by the time they'd found it, it was the size of a football-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;192;therapist;Oh, dear.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;193;client; and it was- it was too late to operate then.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;194;therapist;Right. Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;195;client;So, you know, when I go to bed at night now, um, I just feel to make sure there's nothing different going on.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;196;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;197;client;And, uh, yeah, I worry about that.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;198;therapist;So you're- you-you're kind of prodding, having a feel at night?;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;199;client;Oh, yes.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;200;therapist;To see if you can feel anything?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;201;client;Yes.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;202;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;203;client;I just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there, you know?;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;204;therapist;Right. Okay.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;205;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;206;therapist;Okay. So just to-to make sure that I've got the-the story straight, you've-you've seen Dr. Brown for a couple of years.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;207;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;208;therapist;You've-you've tried a variety of medications-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;209;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;210;therapist;- some prescribed, some-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;211;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;212;therapist;- from the-the herbal shop. None of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;213;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;214;therapist;- but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And at times, you worry that this could be something quite serious like a-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;215;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;216;therapist;- a cancer. Is that-- Have I got the-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;217;client;Yes.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;218;therapist; story right?;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;219;client;Yes. Yeah.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;220;therapist;Okay.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;221;client;I'd say so.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;222;therapist;Okay. Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;223;client;Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;224;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;225;client;- and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether, you know, with new eyes and a new way of looking at-at the problem-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;226;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;227;client;- um, you-you probably know about different tests, new tests, that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;228;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;229;client;So perhaps you could send me for some different tests.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;230;therapist;Right. Right. So you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;231;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;232;therapist;Okay.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;233;client;Well, I think there's-there's got to be something that a test might-;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;234;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;235;client; might reveal.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;236;therapist;Right. Okay. Well, I think, Barbara, having-having heard your story, and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've-you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and-and they've not shown anything. And your symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that-that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So a bit-- I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;237;client;So-so like, do you think it's all in my head then? You're gonna be like Dr. Brown. You think I'm imagining all of this?;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;238;therapist;Uh, no. I think that you clearly have pain, and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms, and they're clearly getting in the way of-;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;239;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;240;therapist;-your life and causing you a lot-;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;241;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;242;therapist;of disability.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;243;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;244;therapist;I guess- I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;245;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;246;therapist;Sometimes these things can go together. Uh, I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year, when your son got married, uh, and you were very busy-;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;247;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;248;therapist;- and quite happy, that somehow your symptoms seemed less.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;249;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;250;therapist;And, uh, when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much, sometimes, somehow, your symptoms then will seem greater. So, I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara, is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind, and what's going on in your life, and-and how much your symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility?;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;251;client;Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain.;;sustain36;high;changing approach to disease;252;therapist;Mm. I'm not saying that the pain's in your mind. Um, I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going, can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really, with those, none of those have really helped you-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;253;client;No.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;254;therapist;- I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;255;client;What-what sort of approach?;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;256;therapist;Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life, um, uh, I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have really shrunk down.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;257;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;258;therapist;And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do. That you-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;259;client;No.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;260;therapist; used to get pleasure out of. is that right?;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;261;client;Well, I just can't do them.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;262;therapist;Yeah.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;263;client;I can't- I can't do them anymore.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;264;therapist;Yeah. And I guess I wonder-- Uh, it sounds as though you've-you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them, but I wonder if, in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling-;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;265;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;266;therapist; unhappy with the way that-that your life is at the moment. and-and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;267;client;Oh, I don't know.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;268;therapist;Mm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;269;client;I don't know.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;270;therapist;Well, I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life, and what you do with your day, and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things, you know, even if it's just meeting up-;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;271;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;272;therapist;- with your-your female friends once a week, and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally-;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;273;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;274;therapist;- improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking.;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;275;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;276;therapist;And the fact that you-you seem to be taking quite a lot of them, and I'm wondering whether it's worth, though, sitting and looking at them and-and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit, and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse, I guess.;reflection;36;high;changing approach to disease;277;client;Hmm. Yeah.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;278;therapist;What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say-say two or three months, just to see whether or not it makes any difference?;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;279;client;Well, two or three months is a long time if there is something going on. I mean, that's what happened to my mother-in-law, you know.;;sustain36;high;changing approach to disease;280;therapist;Right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;281;client;They-they left her and-;;sustain36;high;changing approach to disease;282;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;283;client;- didn't spot it and—;;sustain36;high;changing approach to disease;284;therapist;Well, I guess if we- if we did decide to-to work together like this-;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;285;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;286;therapist;- in this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly. We can keep an eye on your symptoms, and if they change, then we can investigate as appropriate. But if they stay the same, then, you know, we can be-;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;287;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;288;therapist;- pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that-that we're missing.;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;289;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;290;therapist;How would that sound?;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;291;client;So, uh, what are you saying then? That I should come back and see you?;;change36;high;changing approach to disease;292;therapist;I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun to talk about it-;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;293;client;Mm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;294;therapist;- and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back. Perhaps if you're booked in for a double slot next week, and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach.;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;295;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;296;therapist;And perhaps if you could also bring your-your tablets in or-or make a list of them, we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound, Barbara?;therapist_input;36;high;changing approach to disease;297;client;Okay. Well, uh, to make an appointment for next week.;;change36;high;changing approach to disease;298;therapist;Yeah.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;299;client;And come and see you again-;;change36;high;changing approach to disease;300;therapist;Yes.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;301;client; and talk about it a bit more?;;change36;high;changing approach to disease;302;therapist;Yes. I think so.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;303;client;Okay.;;change36;high;changing approach to disease;304;therapist;I think that would be a good- a good start.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;305;client;All right. And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking.;;change36;high;changing approach to disease;306;therapist;Yeah.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;307;client;I won't bring all the bottles down.;;change36;high;changing approach to disease;308;therapist;Okay. All right.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;309;client;Okay. All right. I'll do that.;;change36;high;changing approach to disease;310;therapist;So, shall I see you again next week?;question;36;high;changing approach to disease;311;client;I'll make an appointment for next week. Yes.;;change36;high;changing approach to disease;312;therapist;Okay. All right. Thank you, Barbara.;other;36;high;changing approach to disease;313;client;Okay. Thank you.;;neutral36;high;changing approach to disease;314;therapist;Bye-bye.;other;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, Sarah, it's great to meet you. My name is Delwyn, and I'm a counselor here at the clinic. And I heard from your nurse practitioner that you recently had an annual exam in which the topics of smoking and alcohol use came up. Would you mind filling me in a little bit about that?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Yeah, um, last week I met with my nurse practitioner, and I ge-I guess she's worried with how much I'm smoking and drinking right now. I mean, I-I did agree I would work on the smoking and try to cut back on that. But, as far as the drinking, I-I don't really think I drink that much.;;sustain38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;So, you've decided you wanna cut back on your smoking a little bit, but, you're not really concerned about your drinking.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Right, I mean, I don't drink that much and, honestly, it-it's just a good way to relax.;;sustain38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;It's a nice sort of form of stress relief.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah, exactly. You know, it's kind of like that me time at the end of the day.;;sustain38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Sort of escape from your hectic schedule.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Yeah. You know, I have a two-year-old son, and then, I work full-time. And, I also started going back to school. So, you know, just trying to juggle all that stuff. You know, it's tiring, and so, you know, at the end of the day, I just- I wanna relax and enjoy myself.;;sustain38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;So, you're working, and then, on top of that, juggling being a single mom and going to school?;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Yeah, and for work, you know, I'm a server. So, I'm on my feet all day, you know, and it's-it's really tiring.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;It's pretty exhausting work.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Yeah, you know, it's hard trying to please customers all day. And then, at the same time, I'm-I'm worrying, am I making enough money to support my son, you know?;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;So, you're not only doing really tiring work and going to school, but you're also worrying about your finances.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah, and then, you know, with going back to school, you know, I have to figure out how I'm going to pay for everything. So, you know, i-it's just a lot right now.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Yeah, it does. It sounds like a lot that you're trying to deal with, and it makes sense that you feel like you need some kind of break or reward.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;So, tell me a little bit more about your drinking. Tell me a little bit about how much you're drinking, and, um, the pattern, and what raised concern.;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Well, that's the thing. I-I don't really understand what raised concern. I mean, I don't drink that much, you know. I've-I've gone up to maybe two drinks a day max, you know.;;sustain38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;So, you're drinking, perhaps, two drinks a day. Um, and I'm wondering, what have you heard about the recommendations for drinking levels?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Not much.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Okay, will you be interested in hearing about those recommendations?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Sure.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Okay. Well, so, the recommendation for women is to have no more than three drinks a day, and no more than seven drinks over the course of a week. Yeah, um, and, really, the reason for those recommendations is to just reduce the risk that people have trouble with accidents, or chronic diseases. Like certain types of cancers, or high blood pressure, and then also psychological problems. I don't know what you think about all that?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;I don't know, i-it just surprises me because, I mean, two drinks a day, that-that doesn't seem like a problem or risky, you know. And, I have family members who drink a lot more than that per day, and, it's not a problem for them. So, i-it just surprises me.;;sustain38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;It just doesn't seem that abnormal to you, especially when you compare it with your family.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;No. And then, I don't know, I-I'm just getting kind of annoyed, honestly, because, you know, I did agree I would try to work on my smoking, you know. But, with this whole drinking thing, it's like everything that I enjoy, you know, is being taken away from me right now. And so, if I give up drinking, like, what am I going to have to enjoy myself, you know.;;sustain38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Yeah, you really feel like you need that reward.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;And then it also sounds like, um, your drinking has perhaps increased a little bit over time?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yeah, I mean, I guess it has. Probably just with being so stressed out every day, you know. I mean, I'm in my second semester of school right now, and so, adding that to everything, uh, it's a lot. And, you know, I'm trying to figure out child carry. Um, normally, my mom will watch my son, but, lately, she can't always. And so, I'm always kind of worrying like, will she be able to, you know. So, i-it's just stressful.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Yeah, and so it sounds like you've noticed that the more stressed you're feeling, the more you're drinking.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Yeah, I-I guess that's right.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;So, let me summarize a little bit what you've told me. It sounds like you have a pretty hectic, stressful life, and you really feel like you need some kind of-;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Uh-huh.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;-reward or stress relief. Um, and then, on the other hand, you've noticed, um, that your drinking has increased a little bit over time. And also that the more stressed you're fe- you feel, the more you're inclined to drink.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Yeah.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;So, I'm wondering, have you noticed any problems from your drinking?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;No. I guess, you know, the one- the one thing I can think of is, I mean, there will be evenings when I just kind of want to get my son to bed a little earlier, just so that I can have that alone time to unwind, you know, maybe-maybe smoke, have a couple drinks. Um, but, I do feel guilty about that sometimes, because, I should enjoy spending time with my son, but, instead, you know, I'm just wanting to be by myself and relax, you know. So—;;change38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;So, you've noticed that it's starting to call to you a little bit in the evenings.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;And it's perhaps taking you away from things that are more important to you?;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;And it doesn't feel good?;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;No.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Yeah. And so, it sounds like there's a bit of a dilemma there, because-- And I guess we should be clear, it's not the occasional drink that's an issue. Um, it's-it's really the quantity of drinking, and-and whether your drinking is escalating and interfering with things that are, perhaps, more important.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;Yeah.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;And you've perhaps never seen it in that light before.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;No. And, i-it's just, it's really hard to take in right now. I mean, yeah. I-I've never thought about it like this. And, so, you know, I-I do feel kind of worried.;;change38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;I-it seems like it-it would be quite a hard pattern to change.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Yeah. I mean, i-it's part of my routine right now, and, you know, I-I don't want to sacrifice something I enjoy, but, you know, I'm trying really hard, you know, to be a good mom. I'm-I'm trying to, you know, go-go back to school. I'm trying to work. So, I don't know how I can do all of that if I don't have a way to enjoy myself or relax, you know?;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;So, it seems like it would be really difficult to change because it's something that's really important to you right now.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Yeah.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;But on the other hand, it does sound like there are things that you- that you value that you don't want the drinking to interfere with.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Yeah.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;So, I guess I'm wondering if you've given any thought to other ways in which you could cope with stress without relying on the drinking so much.;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Well, you know, if there was some way that I could relieve some of my stress, I think I would feel better, and, you know, maybe at night, I wouldn't feel like I had to unwind in the same way.;;change38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;So, if you could somehow tackle some of these stressful issues, um, that could make a difference, and, what-what would that be, for example?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Um, you know, probably my biggest problem is just childcare. You know, my mom normally watches my son, but she's been kind of backing out lately. And so, I'm worrying, am I going to have to call into work today, am-am I going to have to miss class? You know, so, you know, worrying about that really stresses me out, you know.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;So, having more reliable childcare could make a big difference.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Yeah, definitely.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;And it sounds like your mom has been an option in the past, but perhaps not so much anymore.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yeah. I mean, she watches him so much. I think she's just probably getting stressed out too. And, I feel bad because, you know, it's not her son, so i-it shouldn't be her problem, but, I need something that I can rely on better.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;So, one thing that could make a big difference is if you could figure out some sort of more reliable, affordable childcare, and that would help you not want to drink as much.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Yeah.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Anything else?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Well, I mean, most of my problems always go back to money. You know, i-if I had more money, I could afford daycare, I could work less hours, you know? So, yeah. It's-it's normally related to money.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Yeah. It-it sounds like, um, you know, money could make a big difference, and you are working full time and trying to go to school to address that in the long run. Um, but on the other hand, you know, it sounds like you have some other ideas of cope- of how you might cope with stress better. Um, so, I guess I'm-I'm wondering, given our conversation so far, kind of where you are with everything.;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;therapist;Um, we started off talking about how your drinking has sort of drifted into a risky area, and it would be advisable to cut back. Um, but it sounds like you feel like that's fairly important to you and not something you necessarily want to do. But on the other hand, we've talked about ways in which that perhaps could be made a bit easier, but I'm not sure if you're ready to tackle that or pursue that right now. I'm just kind of wondering where you are.;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;client;Yeah. I mean, I'm ready to consider changing my drinking, but, as far as actually doing it, I-I don't know. I mean, I have a lot of problems that I'm trying to work out right now.;;change38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;therapist;So, um, it would perhaps be helpful if you could narrow it down to just one thing, and what would that be?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;client;Childcare, probably.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;therapist;Okay. Yeah. It sounds like from everything you're saying, that keeps coming up as one of the main issues. Um, so there may be some resources I can point you towards, but I'm- guess I'm wondering, have you looked into alternatives, more affordable, reliable childcare?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;client;Not really. I mean, I just normally see if my mom can watch my son, so, you know, I haven't really looked around.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;therapist;Okay. Well, one thing you could consider is talking to one of our social workers, they sort of specialize in helping people who have a lot on their plate identifying resources that they may need, uh, things you haven't thought of or aren't aware of. So, I don't know, would you be interested in doing something like that?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;client;Yeah, definitely.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;therapist;Okay. Great. Well, I can definitely set you up with that, and you can-;other;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;therapist;-um, try to tackle, um, your childcare issue, um, with some assistance. Is there anything else you'd like to do, um, for example, would you be interested in talking with me again, um, just as things progress?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;client;Yeah, I-I think I would. I mean, it's-it's been nice to just talk about everything that's going on.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;therapist;Yeah. So, these are not problems that are going to go away in a week. It's going to take some time to resolve. Okay, great. So, um, it sounds like we have a couple of things, uh, to pursue.;other;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;therapist;Anything-anything else?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;client;Mm-mm;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;therapist;Would you be interested in perhaps thinking about setting a goal with respect to your drinking?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;client;Well, I mean, I could at least try to going back to one drink a night instead of two.;;change38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;therapist;Okay. Try to cut back a bit and see how that goes.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;client;Yeah. I mean, I-I don't know how it's going to go, especially with trying to cut back on smoking already, but, I mean, I can try.;;change38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;therapist;Okay. So, you can give it a go and, I think doing managing, you might just learn a little bit about how easy or difficult it's going to be, and-and also what it's like to cope with stress in other ways.;reflection;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;client;Yeah.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;therapist;Okay. So, it sounds like we have two avenues to pursue, anything else?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;client;I don't think so.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;91;therapist;Okay. Well, that sounds good. So, why don't we meet again in a couple of weeks and you kind of update me on how cutting back on your drinking has gone, and also, what it was like when you met with a social worker? Sound good?;question;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;92;client;Yeah.;;neutral38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;93;therapist;Okay, great. I look forward to talking next time.;other;38;high;reducing alcohol consumption;94;client;Okay. Thanks.;;neutral40;high;reducing drug use;0;client;Pretty good. It's been three months now.;;neutral40;high;reducing drug use;1;therapist;Nice.;other;40;high;reducing drug use;2;client;Um, and—;;neutral40;high;reducing drug use;3;therapist;Since the-- since you used, uh-- since the last time you used meth, right?;question;40;high;reducing drug use;4;client;Right.;;neutral40;high;reducing drug use;5;therapist;Okay.;other;40;high;reducing drug use;6;client;Right. It's been three months, and I've been doing pretty well.;;change40;high;reducing drug use;7;therapist;Good.;other;40;high;reducing drug use;8;client;Um, and I met a couple new friends.;;neutral40;high;reducing drug use;9;therapist;Nice.;other;40;high;reducing drug use;10;client;So—;;neutral40;high;reducing drug use;11;therapist;So-so, uh, have-- last time we talked, you know, you were kind of cutting the-the ex-boyfriend out. This is because he was your dealer, so--;reflection;40;high;reducing drug use;12;client;Right.;;change40;high;reducing drug use;13;therapist;And how is that going for you?;question;40;high;reducing drug use;14;client;Right. It's been good. I haven't answered the phone when he's called-;;change40;high;reducing drug use;15;therapist;Okay.;other;40;high;reducing drug use;16;client;-and a couple of my other friends have tried to call me as well, and I haven't answered the phone. Um, so it's been good for me to just reach out and like, meet a couple of new people, um, in the neigh-neighborhood that I'm living in.;;change40;high;reducing drug use;17;therapist;So it sounds like you've made some good changes. The change in your environment, and some of your behaviors, and, uh, and these new friends.;reflection;40;high;reducing drug use;18;client;Yeah, the new friends, and I've been using the, you know, the breathing exercises you taught me, when I get-- start to feel a little stressed out, and I've been- I've been using those and it helps me. I go for a walk and do my breathing exercises, and it calms me down and kind of gets me through that time.;;change40;high;reducing drug use;19;therapist;So it sounds like--;other;41;high;unidentifiable;0;therapist;So, thank you for coming in today.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;1;client;Yes.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;2;therapist;How are you feeling today?;question;41;high;unidentifiable;3;client;I feel great actually.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;4;therapist;Yeah? Good.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;5;client;Yeah.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;6;therapist;Good.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;7;client;I feel good.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;8;therapist;And so you did your clarifications, value clarifications-;question;41;high;unidentifiable;9;client;Yeah.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;10;therapist;and What are your top five?;question;41;high;unidentifiable;11;client;Yes. It was a good, uh, experience for me. It was different. It was different than usual. There were several things that were different, and, uh, the number one value that I put was self-respect. And I-I don't even know if self-respect has ever been in my top five let alone my number one.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;12;therapist;Really?;question;41;high;unidentifiable;13;client;Yeah. And, um—;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;14;therapist;Do you have any idea why that is?;question;41;high;unidentifiable;15;client;I do have an idea, I think, why that is. Um, I think that there's been a few things that have happened recently and something that really came to my awareness, when I visited with my family, is that I have consistently through my whole life, probably, put other people first. And I have consistently, uh, almost not even considered myself in the equation. It was, uh, kind of sad in a way, at the time that I realized it. Uh, I didn't realize how severe it actually was, but I was kind of glad that I realized it because I feel like it's never too late to change-;;change41;high;unidentifiable;16;therapist;True.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;17;client;-and I feel like I can- I can, uh, respect and value myself just as much as I have other people. I know that's important. And I feel like when I do that, I'm a better person for other people as well.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;18;therapist;Mm-hmm. By not putting yourself on the back burner so much?;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;20;therapist;Yeah.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;21;client;Because I get stressed, I get resentful, I get overwhelmed and, uh, out of- out of alignment, I guess, out of sorts.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;23;client;And I can't be the best- the best me possible.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;24;therapist;For someone else?;question;41;high;unidentifiable;25;client;Yeah.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;26;therapist;For your family?;question;41;high;unidentifiable;27;client;For myself or for someone else, either way, yeah.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;28;therapist;You think it is so much of a fact that you put yourself on the back burner that you were neglecting yourself, or that you were putting others so much before you that you just didn't even think about yourself?;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;29;client;I-it's almost-- Like, I think that some people might not even think that I put that first, but in my mind and my emotions, I was carrying concern about what other people think, and I was letting that concern dictate my actions. Instead of letting my own values dictate my actions, I was letting what I thought other people wanted me to do to dictate my actions.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;30;therapist;Wow.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;31;client;And that's something that I had done for so long, literally since I was a child, that I didn't even know I was doing it.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;32;therapist;There's so much of your-- Part of your paradigm?;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;33;client;Yes, yes.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;34;therapist;So, do you think sometimes you weren't even aware;question;41;high;unidentifiable;35;client;Not aware at all. Completely unaware. Totally unaware, yeah. And so to me, I feel like it's a celebration. I used to, uh, moan and complain about my childhood and about all the things that I didn't get to have, and all the cruel, mean things that people said and did, and I felt-- I feel like I had this aha moment where I realized that I could be my own parent, and I could give myself the things that weren't given to me, now. I can give myself a voice. I can give myself an opinion. I can live like that, if I want to. Nobody's stopping me from it, only me.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;36;therapist;Yeah.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;37;client;So, that's what I want to do.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;38;client;Mm-hmm.And it's the first time in my life I haven't felt guilty for saying that.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;39;therapist;The very first time that you can remember?;question;41;high;unidentifiable;40;client;I would say so, yeah. I don't know if I've ever said that in front of people and not felt the least twinge of guilt for it. [chuckles];;change41;high;unidentifiable;41;therapist;That's not a selfish thing.;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;42;client;No-;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;43;therapist;Right.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;44;client;-it's not, it's really not.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;45;therapist;Cool, that's great.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;46;client;Yeah.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;47;therapist;Yeah. And so you felt you came about this change, and-and-and how does it make you feel?;question;41;high;unidentifiable;48;client;Well, it makes me feel jubilant. It makes me feel joyful. It makes me feel hopeful. It makes me feel like I count, like I matter. Uh, it makes me feel like I'm going to be able to do what I want to do with more joy and more passion, and less dread and a sense of responsibility, because one of the things that kind of happened along the way I really didn't notice, is that, um-- Like, let's say for example I like being a teacher or I like being a teacher or I like being a counselor to a certain degree but because of all the shoulds and all of the sense of responsibility and all of the caring about what people think, I started to lose joy doing things I actually enjoy doing.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;49;therapist;Because you're- felt so obligated.;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;50;client;Yes, because it turned into an obligation instead of just really really a sense of like you know passion you know. My passion is gone completely. I don't know I'm just happy to, I feel like I got back in touch with myself. It's like I was like lost for a while and now I'm like back again, yes, now I remember why I wanted to do this or like why this is important to me because it is actually one of my values to be and help, but it just has to be, uh, balanced.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;51;therapist;Yeah, is that on your top five also;question;41;high;unidentifiable;52;client;No, but um, the other ones I have on there, uh are, number two, inner harmony. For the same reason, like I feel like I need to harmonious within myself before I can be harmonious with other people.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;53;therapist;You get peace with yourself?;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;54;client;Yes, and then I put family happiness.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;55;therapist;That's very good.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;56;client;Yes, because I think that when I'm at peace with myself, uh, that automatically contributes to my family happiness. When I am unhappy with myself, I bring my unhappiness to my family.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;57;therapist;Sure.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;58;client;Uh, yeah, when I don't have self-respect and I am only giving my family a say on who I am and what I should do, I'm angry at them, I quarrel them.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;59;therapist;You feel resentful.;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;60;client;"I resent them, I really do, when I am in the mode. But when I just say, ""Hey, I'm a person of this family and I deserve this much time and energy and attention and just more than anybody else,"" I don't care, you do what I do I do what I do life goes on [chuckles].";;change41;high;unidentifiable;61;therapist;Right.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;62;client;And then I have health and achievement, and to me, this one on achievement says a sense of accomplishment and to me that kind of goes along with what we were talking about earlier like I think I can show up and be a teacher and be a counselor in many different, uh, capacities. I could be your- I could be- I could be a teacher and I could be a really bad teacher. I could still be a teacher you know, I could show up an I could just do a really poor job and I could go home and I probably could keep my job for a while, it wouldn't be the first time right?;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;63;therapist;Right.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;64;client;But I don't feel good about that.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;65;therapist;You don't feel fulfilled.;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;66;client;No.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;67;therapist;Like you've done anything helpful.;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;68;client;Right, right.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;69;therapist;It's because you showed up and you gave out;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;70;client;It's not enough for me to just show up and get my paycheck. That doesn't, I don't feel fulfilled so it-it, that's the way I see it going together with the helping. It's not just about helping to like look good or to exhaust myself or do what I think I should do but to really give something needy, something substantive, something real.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;71;therapist;Meaningful.;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;72;client;Yeah, meaningful, even if it's-it's small.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;73;therapist;Sometimes it's the small things that really count, too.;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;74;client;Yeah.;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;75;therapist;So all of these things put together feel like right now at this point in life, that it is really healthy change for you, like where you are right now.;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;76;client;Yeah. Yeah.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;77;therapist;That's great and is there anything else on the list you felt like it was coming close to some of the other top five that you had or something similar?;question;41;high;unidentifiable;78;client;Well, one of the things about this list that kind of surprised me is almost every time I have done this list, uh, creativity and freedom have been really high up there. And it didn't even make it to my top five. It was in my top 12.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;79;therapist;Uh-uh.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;80;client;But I think the conclusion that I came to is that I can be more creative and have more freedom if I have inner peace and self-respect. Part of what- part of what binds me, part of what takes my freedom away is when I just explain all over the place and I don't give any attention to myself. Part of what steals my creativity is when I'm- my mind is reeling around in stress and I am not- I can't even hear myself. I can't even hear myself think. How can you be creative if you can't even hear yourself?;;neutral41;high;unidentifiable;81;therapist;All the chattering.;reflection;41;high;unidentifiable;82;client;Yeah, exactly, to me the creativity comes from the silence, comes from the quiet. It's literally-- I can just be in silence for even if for a few moments. It's amazing the ideas that come to me so quickly and so easily that would take me hours to figure out if I'm stressing.;;change41;high;unidentifiable;83;therapist;Thank you so much for sharing.;other;41;high;unidentifiable;84;client;Thank you, thank you for listening.;;change42;high;diet and weight loss management;0;client;I don't know, I'm just having a lot of hard trouble trying to lose the rest of the weight. Um, right now, it's like no matter how much I try to exercise, run, or whatever, it doesn't matter like nothing else is coming off.;;neutral42;high;diet and weight loss management;1;therapist;Right, so you've hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you're trying to do to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to be working on the scale?;reflection;42;high;diet and weight loss management;2;client;No, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong because I keep trying the exercise but nothing's happening.;;change42;high;diet and weight loss management;3;therapist;Right. So you feel like you're spinning your wheels, you're doing more exercising and it's not showing results on the scale?;reflection;42;high;diet and weight loss management;4;client;Yes.;;neutral42;high;diet and weight loss management;5;therapist;And you're not feeling so good about that?;reflection;42;high;diet and weight loss management;6;client;No, and even when I'm coming home, like, I'll go to the gym and then I'm noticing nothing is happening and I'll come home and I try to talk to my mama about it or even my father, and no one even cares about it. Like no one wants to support in it anyway.;;change42;high;diet and weight loss management;7;therapist;Uh, so you feel like you're doing this all alone?;reflection;42;high;diet and weight loss management;8;client;Yes.;;neutral42;high;diet and weight loss management;9;therapist;At home or you think that they'll be supportive but they're not giving- they're not giving you what you need?;reflection;42;high;diet and weight loss management;10;client;No, and specifically my father, he just-- Not only does he not want to support me with it but at the same time, he feels like I need to be gaining my weight back.;;neutral42;high;diet and weight loss management;11;therapist;Oh, okay.;other;42;high;diet and weight loss management;12;client;So I—;;neutral42;high;diet and weight loss management;13;therapist;Tell me about that.;question;42;high;diet and weight loss management;14;client;It's as though by me losing weight, it's like I'm somehow disconnecting from my family, and he thinks that I'm trying to form myself to fit into like this perfect American picture and I just want to be healthy, I just want to have a good body and he doesn't think of it that way.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;Well, thank you, Tanya, for meeting with me today and talking about this. So, there is something I'd like to ask you that we can kind of discuss in our conversation is what's one thing about yourself or something in your life that you'd like to change that maybe you've been feeling kind of ambivalent about?;therapist_input;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;Um, well, you know, I have a lot of anxiety, and so there's this test that I have to take. It's a big test and I've kind of been putting it off just 'cause I get very anxious. I don't trust in myself that I'm going to do good at it. Um, and so that's something that's like always on my mind, it's been on my mind for many years and it's like, I gotta just do it. Um, but I always stop myself from doing that because of the anxiety. And I just want to, I don't want to feel that way.;;change43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;Yeah. This anxiety is this obstacle for you and it sounds like it, then you're just not feeling confident that you could do it and do it successfully to this exam.;reflection;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;And so, it's easier for you to just not do it.;reflection;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;Exactly. So, I just avoid it and put it off.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;Yeah. So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident. How confident are you that you feel you can manage your anxiety in regards to taking this exam?;question;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;Um, maybe like a four or five.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;Okay. So, four or five. How combat, like, not like a two or three.;question;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;I mean, because I-I have it set up after like so many years, so I still have a ton of anxiety about it, but I think I'm like kind of making it, maybe that first step. And so that's why I would rate it as like a four or five because I'm making that first step, but it's still scary for me.;;change43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;Yeah. Yeah, and you also mentioned that you've actually made the appointment that you have to take this exam.;reflection;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;client;Yeah.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;therapist;And before you've been putting it off.;reflection;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;client;Yes. And I already kind of put it off after s-scheduling it too. So, um, now I'm actually enjoying that because I-I already like changed date and everything. So now it's actually coming.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;therapist;Okay. So, you've made this appointment before in the past and the anxiety has kind of taken over where you've rescheduled it.;reflection;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;client;Yes.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;therapist;And this time, it seems like it's a little bit different this time. How come this time you feel like you might not reschedule this time around?;question;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;client;Um, well I think it's this kind of long time coming. I just need to do it and then I can figure out, if I don't pass, I have to wait three more months to do it. And then I just study for the next three months. And if I do, then I can have that weight lifted off my shoulders cause it's been all a lot of weight on me and I think about it every single day. And I'm just sick of thinking about it.;;change43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;therapist;So that's really encouraging you thinking about how good you'll feel afterwards once it's done and taken.;other;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;client;Yeah. But then I do worry, you know, that negative talk that, you know, when you have anxiety. So then I worry about if I don't pass it, you know, like people are going to ask me how I did and if I don't pass it I'm gonna have to tell them, it's embarrassing for me. Um, so that makes me really anxious.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;therapist;Yeah. You kind of want to avoid that. Yeah. Have those other feelings that could come up and if you don't have.;reflection;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;client;Right.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;therapist;I'd love to hear from you. When was the time in the past that you were feeling anxious about something and you actually did it and it turned out well?;question;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;client;Uh, I would say maybe like four or five years ago, um, I had to do a recording for work and I did not want to do it. I was trying to find every way that I can get out of during this recording. And, um, and then I played my recording and because of the way sometimes I carry myself, like not confident and very anxious, um, I think other people don't always believe in me.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;client;And so, um, when I played the recording, it actually ended up being one of the best recordings and like my supervisor and our national consultant, they were very like shocked about it because it because of just was the way I carried myself. So I thought, I don't really like compliments that makes me, um, anxious too again people compliment me, but it was a nice feeling because I really didn't trust in myself. And to know that I did a good job.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;therapist;Yeah.;other;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;client;Um, it made me feel good.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;therapist;So, in that experience, it really built up your self-confidence and it almost not only changed the way you saw yourself, but maybe how other people saw you and you really, you liked that feeling.;reflection;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;client;Yeah, I did.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;therapist;Yeah. And that must've been really brave for you to do something that seems really daunting at first, yet you were really successful at it.;other;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;client;Yeah.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;therapist;Um, how do you think you could relate that to what you're dealing with now?;question;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;client;I mean, I think again, like all that anxiety, the same anxiety I had with that I have with those tests. And so, um, but that if I pass this test, if I could have that same feeling that I had, like when I did a good job like the-- you know, I mean, I would like to have that feeling again.;;change43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;therapist;Mm-hmm;other;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;client;You know.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;therapist;So for you to create opportunities to create those moments that you can have that feeling again;reflection;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;client;Right;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;therapist;And you just mentioned too, you feel really proud of yourself.;other;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;client;Yeah.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;therapist;So to end our conversation, how do you think you couldn't move? You originally said, you were at four or five, what would have to happen to get you to like a seven, to feel more confident?;question;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;client;Well, considering this test is coming on the way in a few days, um, I think, for me and just like practicing and just really seeing how I do and if I do well, then I think my confidence might go up a little bit.;;change43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;41;therapist;Mm-hmm;other;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;client;And maybe just having that faith in myself that, you know, that I can do it instead of just thinking that I can't.;;change43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;43;therapist;So that positive self-talk could really go a long way for you?;question;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;44;client;Yeah. Mm-hmm.;;change43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;therapist;So to summarize, it sounds like you are still feeling kind of anxious about this test coming up, you've rescheduled it, um, over the past couple years. Yet, this time around, you seem more confident to just get it done. And you've even mentioned times in the past where you were feeling anxious and you were successful about it and that you felt proud about yourself. And you liked the way it means, you see yourself and how others saw you, and it seems like y-you're ready to finish this exam and-and remind yourself that you can be successful?;reflection;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;46;client;Yeah.;;change43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;47;therapist;Okay. Well, thank you, Tanya.;other;43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;48;client;Thank you.;;neutral43;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;49;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hey, hi, Andrea.

I usually meet with you once or twice a semester. And I'm going to be talking to you kind of about your life and your goals and some behaviors that you might engage in and just the sorts of things like that.;reflection;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;So why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourself?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Uh, well, my name is Andrea, as you know, I'm, uh, in the marching band.

How long ago did you start playing saxophone?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Well, saxophone. I started about four years ago, but I've been involved in music for about 10 years now, so.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Wow. That's a long time. What other instruments?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;I started off on the violin first.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;No kidding.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;So I played that for like six years, once a clarinet, dabbled here and there with different things. And then I found the one- the one for me.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;That's awesome.

And putting on this entire show-;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;-it's very exciting, very exhilarating once you're in competition.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;It's very cool.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Cool. And do you have a lot of friends who are in band with you or-;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yeah.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;friends outside of band or?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;I have, um, you know, I have two-two separate groups. I have my friends from class and then my friends from bra-- from band.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Okay.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;So.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Great.

[laughs];;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;Okay. What kind of dog do you have?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;He's a golden retriever.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;Oh, nice.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Charlie.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Charlie.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;He's a big boy.

I'd like to become a doctor one day, so.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Wow.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;I'm interested in psychology, psychiatry, something like that, so.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;You've got big dreams.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Yeah.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Cool. All right. Have you started thinking about schools or majors? I guess you're thinking about psychology as a major.;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Yeah, psychology, I haven't really thought too about which school, I mean, I-;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Right.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Everyone wants to shoot for the Ivy leagues, so [chuckles];;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;All right. And how about your grades?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Uh, they're pretty good, you know, high three-point somethings.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Okay. Good. Very good. All right. Well, what are the kinds of things do you do for fun on weekends?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Uh, I usually go out with my friends. Uh, we'll go to the movies or we'll most likely we'll just meet up at someone's house-;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;and just hang out and things.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Mm-hmm. When you're hanging out, is there ever alcohol?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Sometimes, [chuckles] I'm gonna be honest sometimes.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Uh-huh So how often do you think you drink alcohol?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Um, depending on how much schoolwork there is When there's not, it might be like every other weekend or like three weekends out of the month or something like that.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Oh, so you're drinking a lot?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;A little, yeah.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;Okay. And how much are you drinking on the days that you're-- on the days that you drink?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;Um, I don't, we don't get blackout drunk or anything. It's more of like a little tipsy kind of thing.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;I have gotten blackout drunk before-;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;-but I kind of did that, learned my lesson, didn't like it.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;Got it. So you've-you've had some pretty heavy drinking. What-what do you think is the most you've ever had?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;Like how many drinks?;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;Yeah.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Um, it was a good amount. It was the first time I ever drank and it was like three or four cups, but it was mixing different things.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;Okay, so you don't even know.;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;So, I'm not-- Yeah.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;Okay. So, and then your friends drink too?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;Yeah. Yes. Not all of them, but some of them do.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Okay. And how much do they typically drink?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;More or less the same amount. So right now the most we'll have is maybe like one cup after that one time, but sometimes one or two, but they can be kind of heavy.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;Okay, so it's one cup, but it's not-not one drink.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Oh, it's a red, you know, typical. Yeah.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;It has a lot of alcohol in it.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;Okay. Um, so gosh, you're-you're actually really drinking quite a lot. Um, you know, your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group.;therapist_input;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;So, is that surprising to you?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;A little bit.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;Yeah. Um, so we call it high-risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that. So, you know, things like, um, having car accidents, or other accidents, or getting in fights, or, you know, sexual assault, or health problems, or developing alcoholism. Have you thought about those things?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;Not too much, to be honest. I-I've always thought since it's, you know, within my small group of friends-;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;-and we usually sleep over each other's house, we don't get into the problems of drinking and driving, and possibly sexual assaults and things like that.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;But I haven't really thought about possible alcoholism or anything.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;Okay. So it's, um, so it's good, because you're not drinking and driving, but you're still really drinking a lot. Um, and yeah. Okay. So, let's-let's talk a little bit about that, how you might be able to make some changes. Because I think you really need to- need to stop drinking like this.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;Okay.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;So, um, do you think you could quit drinking or?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Yeah, I think I could. I don't need it. For instance, it-it is-- it is used as a kind of, like, let's get the party going.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;But we haven't always had it-;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;-obviously. So, I think it would be possible to stop drinking.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;Okay. So, does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?;reflection;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;"Um, I would probably start off by like, because my friends are also involved, so I'd be like, ""Hey, guys, I don't think I'm gonna drink today.""";;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;108;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;109;client;And kind of see how that goes. Because—;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;110;therapist;Okay. Um, you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work.;reflection;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;111;client;Yeah. It's, you know, it's one thing to control my own drinking, and it's another thing when everyone else around me is drinking and then there's like that pressure-;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;112;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;113;client;"-of, ""Oh, they're gonna think I look stupid.""";;sustain44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;114;therapist;Okay. So, how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;115;client;Yeah.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;116;therapist;Okay. Um, so I mean, do you think they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;117;client;My close ones, I know they wouldn't be, you know, have a problem with that. But the ones that I'm not that close with, but I'll still like hang out with-;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;118;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;119;client;those are probably the ones that like might ostracize me for something or.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;120;therapist;It sounds like you might be better off without them though. They’re-;reflection;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;121;client;Yeah.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;122;therapist; maybe not very good friends.;reflection;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;123;client;Probably, might be too judgmental.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;124;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, um, so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stop drinking.;therapist_input;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;125;client;Okay.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;126;therapist;And, um, I think you should probably stop as soon as possible, like this weekend.;therapist_input;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;127;client;Okay.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;128;therapist;Um, so the way this normally works is, you know, we set you a goal, and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple of weeks and make sure that you actually stopped. Um, and so what do you think about that?;therapist_input;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;129;client;Um, I think-- I think the possibility.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;130;therapist;Okay. So-;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;131;client;I think if you make a good plan, like I think I'd be able to follow through with it.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;132;therapist;Okay, great. So, the plan is gonna be that you're gonna quit and, um, the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive, you're just gonna, I guess, not hang out with anymore.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;133;client;Yeah. I think I can do that.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;134;therapist;Okay. And then, um, you know, like, are your friends in band drinking?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;135;client;Um, not-not really. The ones that drink more are the ones like my class friends. My band friends, we’re focused on band-;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;136;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;137;client;-so I can't really—;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;138;therapist;Okay. So, that might be good, is really just to focus more on band. Um, because you know, the other big concern I have for you is if you wanna go to medical school, you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;139;client;Yeah.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;140;therapist;You know, like college is gonna be really hard. And especially with all those pre-med classes, you're not gonna be able to handle it drinking this much. You know, have you thought about that?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;141;client;Not too much, to be honest.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;142;therapist;Yeah. Okay. So, setting this goal then of quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you. And um, it sounds like i-it shouldn't be that tough really, um, especially because you can just stop hanging out with-;therapist_input;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;143;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;144;therapist;-the people who drink a lot, um, since you have some other friends. Um, yeah. So, do you have any questions for me or?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;145;client;"Um, what should I-- uh, yeah, I do. So what should I say like once, let's say, I hang out with my friends and they're like, ""Hey, why aren't you- why aren't you drinking?""";;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;146;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;147;client;Like how should I go about that situation?;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;148;therapist;"Well, you know, one good option would be to just review with them review with them all the bad things about alcohol. You can say, you know, ""I thought about it, and I realized it's gonna mess up my schoolwork. And you know, it's really a lot of risk for my health."" ""I don't want to become an alcoholic."" Um, you know, ""I don't want to get liver disease."", ""I don't want to end up driving drunk or getting into accidents-";therapist_input;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;149;client;Mm-hmm.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;150;therapist;"-or getting in fights."" You know, one thing you could bring up is, ""I've heard a lot of stories about kids who you know, are at parties and they're drunk and acting stupid, and then people post stuff on Instagram.""";therapist_input;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;151;client;Mm.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;152;therapist;And you know, that's it for their social life. It's like over.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;153;client;Yeah.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;154;therapist;So—;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;155;client;And-and you know, like professional life as well.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;156;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;157;client;I don't want that biting me in the butt, [chuckles] in the back.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;158;therapist;Yeah. So I think just tell your friends you know, you realized there's always bad things about it and you don't want to do it anymore, so you're just not going to.;therapist_input;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;159;client;Okay.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;160;therapist;And then-;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;161;client;I think I can do that.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;162;therapist;-you can tell them to stop too. You know, then that'd be really good. You'd being a good friend.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;163;client;It'd be easier as-- You know, as a group we-we all work together to become better.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;164;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. All right. Any other questions or anything else I can help with?;question;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;165;client;No. I think- I think I'm good.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;166;therapist;Okay. So, like I said, I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple weeks.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;167;client;Okay.;;neutral44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;168;therapist;And make sure that you actually quit drinking.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;169;client;Okay.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;170;therapist;All right.;other;44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;171;client;Sound good.;;change44;low;reducing alcohol consumption;172;therapist;Great.;other;45;high;compliance with rules;0;therapist;Hi, Mary, how was your day?;question;45;high;compliance with rules;1;client;Fine. Where do you want me to sign?;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;2;therapist;Well, you can sign right there. Seems like you're not in the mood to talk today.;reflection;45;high;compliance with rules;3;client;Not really.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;4;therapist;Okay. You know it seems like you had uh, a day at school. I noticed that uh, you missed your first hour of class today as well.;therapist_input;45;high;compliance with rules;5;client;Yeah, whatever. I just, yeah.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;6;therapist;It seems like that doesn't-isn't really a concern for you at this time?;question;45;high;compliance with rules;7;client;It's just like the same thing every day like, I don't really know why. Like um, so I signed your paper, why are asking me all these questions?;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;8;therapist;So you're kind of wondering what the point of these visits are, me coming to your house.;reflection;45;high;compliance with rules;9;client;Yup.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;10;therapist;Okay. Would it be okay with you if I kind of explained again kind of what this program is about?;question;45;high;compliance with rules;11;client;I guess so.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;12;therapist;You know that I will be stopping by every day just to make sure that you're here and following and-and responding to your GPS and making sure that that's charged up every day and that, um, if you're leaving the house without permission, that we will be aware of that as well. Um, and kinda just to get to know you as well when I come for these visits 'cause, um, you know that's kind of my role as your caseworker is just to-to monitor your day-to-day stuff.;therapist_input;45;high;compliance with rules;13;client;So you just wanna know my business?;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;14;therapist;It does kinda come off as nosy at times I'm sure.;reflection;45;high;compliance with rules;15;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;16;therapist;I know uh, some clients have struggled with understanding that I really do care about you. And you know that when we first met that you had expressed a goal of, um, getting off this program as quickly as possible.;other;45;high;compliance with rules;17;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;18;therapist;So I know just kinda being here when you need to be here is one way of doing that.;therapist_input;45;high;compliance with rules;19;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;20;therapist;Yet you still can seem kind of annoyed that this is something that we still have to do.;reflection;45;high;compliance with rules;21;client;Yeah. I mean I guess I'll be here if I have to be but I can't make any promises that I won't leave.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;22;therapist;So you're still kinda concerned that you're not quite sure if you will be able to do this successfully?;question;45;high;compliance with rules;23;client;No, 'cause this just kinda feels like why do you need to know my business? Why do you care?;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;24;therapist;Um, and-and I'm sure that does seem kind of confusing too 'cause I'm sure you've got a lot of other people involved in your life right now with the courts I'm sure, I know that your mom is concerned about you as well and there's this one other person kinda checking in on you as well.;reflection;45;high;compliance with rules;25;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;26;therapist;I'm sure it's pretty overwhelming.;reflection;45;high;compliance with rules;27;client;It's just like a lot.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;28;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;45;high;compliance with rules;29;client;And you feel like there's all these rules.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;30;therapist;Yeah. And there is and I'm sure that it is really struggling at times too.;reflection;45;high;compliance with rules;31;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;32;therapist;Um, and I know some clients have expressed just really valuing their freedom. They didn't realize how much they really valued that until it was gone.;other;45;high;compliance with rules;33;client;Right, I think that's the only thing that I wish I had now.;;change45;high;compliance with rules;34;therapist;Your freedom?;question;45;high;compliance with rules;35;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;36;therapist;What would be some ways you could go about being able to get your freedom back?;question;45;high;compliance with rules;37;client;I guess like your sign your papers.;;change45;high;compliance with rules;38;therapist;Mm-hmm, yup that's one step, just sign the papers when I come by. Even though it seems like it's kinda annoying at times, it is something that we're contracted to do.;therapist_input;45;high;compliance with rules;39;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;40;therapist;What are some other ways you feel like you can get your freedom back?;question;45;high;compliance with rules;41;client;Not do this again so that I don't ever have to be here and be stuck in my house and all of these people coming to visit me and know my business.;;change45;high;compliance with rules;42;therapist;So that's something that will motivate you to not do what you did, not commit that crime, and, um, 'cause you do not like when we stop by?;question;45;high;compliance with rules;43;client;Yup.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;44;therapist;That's okay. Well, I know that you are making an effort. I do appreciate then and when-when I do stop by that you still sign the paperwork even though you feel like it's annoying at times. So, thank you for, uh, at least doing that.;other;45;high;compliance with rules;45;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;46;therapist;Okay. Um, before I leave today is there anything else you'd like to add or-or need to share with me?;other;45;high;compliance with rules;47;client;Not really.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;48;therapist;Okay, well just so you know, again, I do have to come back so I'll see you later today then.;therapist_input;45;high;compliance with rules;49;client;All right.;;neutral45;high;compliance with rules;50;therapist;All right.;other;45;high;compliance with rules;51;client;Bye.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So, Jacob, everything looks very normal on your physical exam. Do you have any questions for me?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;No.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Okay. I see that you filled out our, um, alcohol and drug questionnaire. Is it okay if we go through this together?;other;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Sure.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay. What we talk about is confidential. I only tell your parents about what we say if you give your permission or if I become worried about a danger to-to you or to someone else. Does that make sense?;therapist_input;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay. So, let's take a look. So I see that you have marked that you sometimes use alcohol, and that you have used alcohol to relax, feel better about yourself or fit in. Do you mind telling me a little bit more about your alcohol use?;therapist_input;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;It's not a big deal. Sometimes with my friends, we'll drink a few beers and when we're hanging out or when we're at a party, and sometimes rum and cokes.;;sustain46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay, so how many do you usually have at a time?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, three or four, probably. I don't keep track.;;sustain46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Okay. And how often?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Um, probably about once or twice a month.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Okay. So, you drink with friends, sort of three or four beers or mixed drinks, one or two times a month. How long have you been doing that?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Probably since last October.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;So, for about six months. I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;What do I like about it?;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Yeah.;other;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Um, I don't know. It's just fun to drink with my friends, like when we're at a party at someone else's house, and we're drinking with other people that we don't know. It tastes good.;;sustain46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Okay. So, it sounds like you feel relaxed and have fun when you're drinking with friends and you like the taste.;reflection;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Okay. I'm also curious, are there any parts about your alcohol use that you don't like?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Um, I don't like when I get sick in the mornings 'cause of hangovers and-;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;-when I start throwing up, that's not- I don't like that.;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Have you ever experienced a-a blackout, like when you've been drinking and you wake up and you don't remember what happened?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;No, but that happened to someone I know, though.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay. And have you had any problems related to-to your drinking alcohol, like at home or school or somewhere else?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Um, one time I missed first period of school 'cause I had a hangover and I was late getting up.;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Mm, mom got mad at me 'cause I wouldn't get out of bed and she said she knew I had a hangover.;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Mm-hmm. Have you told your mother that you drink with your friends?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;No, but I got grounded for two weeks after that. [chuckles];;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;So more negative things about your drinking, like getting into trouble with your mom and missing a class at school when you had a hangover?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Yeah, but I only missed school once.;;sustain46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Okay. I see on the questionnaire that you have not ridden in a car with someone who's been drinking and you haven't driven a car, um, after you've been drinking. Is that correct?;therapist_input;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Yeah.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;That's great. And I hope you continue to avoid those things. As your doctor, I want you to know that I'm concerned about your drinking. When teens drink, things can go wrong, like injuring yourself. Even when you don't drink too excess, though, your brain is still developing and is very sensitive to the effects of alcohol.;therapist_input;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Okay.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;That's why I recommend that all my adolescent patients not drink at all. So if you were thinking today about how ready you feel to stop drinking alcohol on a scale of zero to ten, with zero not being ready at all and ten feeling very ready, what number would you pick?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Um, probably a five.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;A five? So, I'm curious. Why didn't you pick a lower number like a two or three that would mean you're only a little bit ready to stop drinking?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Well, I guess I'm just tired of getting in trouble.;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Okay. What could you do to avoid getting into trouble?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, not drink.;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;[chuckles] Have you ever tried not drinking or stopping drinking?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;No, not really.;;sustain46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Okay. What some people your age do is try stopping drinking for a period of time just to see what that feels like.;therapist_input;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;I could probably do that.;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;So, how long do you think you could go without drinking?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;I don't know.;;neutral46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Do you think you could go two months without drinking?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Yeah, probably.;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Okay. What things would make it easier for you to not drink?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Um, I could probably drink something else when my friends are drinking, like just coke.;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Anything else to make things easier for you?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;I can probably hang out with some of my friends who don't drink or inviting them to parties and having fun 'cause not everyone drinks at parties.;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;Okay. Is there anybody in your life that you can talk to about this, who give you some support for not drinking?;question;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah. The-- My friends who don't drink would probably be happy that I'm not drinking either and yes, they'd support me.;;change46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Great. So you've come up with some reasons to stop drinking, like having hangovers and throwing up and getting into trouble. And you've developed some strategies to-to try to not drink, like spending more time with friends who don't drink or having non-alcoholic drinks when people around you are drinking alcohol. I think that's a great plan. I'm really proud of you for giving this a try. How about if I have you make an appointment for two months from now and then I'll see you back and we can see how things are going?;reflection;46;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Okay.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;0;therapist;All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but-;question;49;high;reducing gambling;1;client;Mm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;2;therapist;What was different this time and your thoughts about coming?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;3;client;I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;4;therapist;Yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;5;client;I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles];;change49;high;reducing gambling;6;therapist;Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;7;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;8;therapist;"Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, ""Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together-";therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;9;client;Mm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;10;therapist;"-and, uh--"" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really.";therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;11;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;12;therapist;So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family.;reflection;49;high;reducing gambling;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;14;therapist;Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;15;client;Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles];;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;16;therapist;Yeah. Yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;18;therapist;Yeah. Yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;20;therapist;"Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, ""Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable."" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past?";question;49;high;reducing gambling;21;client;Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles];;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;22;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;23;client;Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;24;therapist;Yeah?;other;49;high;reducing gambling;25;client;That's why I am still a bit—;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;26;therapist;Yeah, that's okay.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;27;client;[chuckles];;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;28;therapist;So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if—;question;49;high;reducing gambling;29;client;When I'm feeling uncomfortable?;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;30;therapist;"Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, ""Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,"" that would be really helpful.";therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;31;client;Okay.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;32;therapist;Yeah?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;33;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;34;therapist;Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.;reflection;49;high;reducing gambling;35;client;Mm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;36;therapist;So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;37;client;[sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt.;;change49;high;reducing gambling;38;therapist;Yeah, okay.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;39;client;Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so-;;change49;high;reducing gambling;40;therapist;Yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;41;client;-I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself.;;change49;high;reducing gambling;42;therapist;Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah.;question;49;high;reducing gambling;43;client;About 80. [chuckles];;change49;high;reducing gambling;44;therapist;About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;45;client;I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident.;;change49;high;reducing gambling;46;therapist;Yeah? But, what would-;question;49;high;reducing gambling;47;client;Yes.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;48;therapist;-your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;49;client;What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles];;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;50;therapist;Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out.;therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;51;client;It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know?;;sustain49;high;reducing gambling;52;therapist;Mm.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;53;client;When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter-;;sustain49;high;reducing gambling;54;therapist;Hmm.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;55;client;-so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles];;sustain49;high;reducing gambling;56;therapist;Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;57;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;58;therapist;Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with—;question;49;high;reducing gambling;59;client;Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles];;sustain49;high;reducing gambling;60;therapist;Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford-;reflection;49;high;reducing gambling;61;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;62;therapist;-'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;63;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;64;therapist;Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;65;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;66;therapist;Yeah? Yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;67;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;68;therapist;There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;69;client;I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but—;;change49;high;reducing gambling;70;therapist;Yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;71;client;Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles];;change49;high;reducing gambling;72;therapist;Mm.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;73;client;I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards-;;change49;high;reducing gambling;74;therapist;Yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;75;client;-so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon.;;change49;high;reducing gambling;76;therapist;Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;77;client;Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles];;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;78;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;79;client;I don't know. Kids maybe, but-;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;80;therapist;Okay.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;81;client;-I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate.;;change49;high;reducing gambling;82;therapist;Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps.;reflection;49;high;reducing gambling;83;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;84;therapist;"Yeah? Yeah. ""Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,"" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time-";reflection;49;high;reducing gambling;85;client;[chuckles];;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;86;therapist;"-wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, ""Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?"" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls a";reflection;49;high;reducing gambling;87;client;Mm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;88;therapist;And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;89;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;90;therapist;When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;91;client;Party girl at 30s is a bit sad, really, isn't it? [chuckles];;change49;high;reducing gambling;92;therapist;I don't know.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;93;client;I don't know. It's been fun up to now-;;sustain49;high;reducing gambling;94;therapist;What's your hunch? Yeah.;question;49;high;reducing gambling;95;client;-but I really do wanna travel, so.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;96;therapist;Yeah, yeah. Where in particular? You've got any ideas about what—;question;49;high;reducing gambling;97;client;Um, Egypt, always been, yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;98;therapist;Egypt?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;99;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;100;therapist;Uh, what's that about Egypt, that, uh?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;101;client;Oh, I just think it's just fascinating.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;102;therapist;Yeah?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;103;client;Yeah. Just the, um, the outlook, and the culture and the history and-;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;104;therapist;Oh.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;105;client;-somewhere I've always wanted to go.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;106;therapist;Yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;107;client;It's not the safest place at the moment, mind you, but [chuckles].;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;108;therapist;No, that's true.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;109;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;110;therapist;But for obvious times.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;111;client;Yep.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;112;therapist;It could be very different.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;113;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;114;therapist;Yeah. Okay, so you've been-- How long have you had this-this idea for that that's what you'd like and that's where you'd like to go?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;115;client;Oh, since I was young, early teens.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;116;therapist;Oh, yeah?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;117;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;118;therapist;Mm. So how much does the kind of, uh, current lifestyle rob you of that, you know, take away from that dream?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;119;client;Yeah, well, I suppose with the amount of money I've spent over the last five years I probably could have gone to Egypt and back five times by now. [chuckles];;change49;high;reducing gambling;120;therapist;Yeah. Well, yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;121;client;Mm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;122;therapist;There you go. So there's some decisions to make around, uh, which dream, which path you wanna follow.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;123;client;Mm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;124;therapist;Hmm. What do you reckon to be the-the hardest bit of taking that pathway to-to traveling and realizing the-the dream? What would be the tough things that you'd have to confront?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;125;client;I believe then to cut off some of my friendships. Um, 'cause since you see that's, you know, part of their lifestyle.;;change49;high;reducing gambling;126;therapist;Yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;127;client;Yeah. It will be a big change.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;128;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So I see this is- this is something you've been thinking about for a while. So how far away do you think you are from that change? You know, 'cause obviously it can-can be on the never, never, but how far away are you from it, making some decisions about that?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;129;client;Seems like a bit of an unrealistic dream. Um, and I'd like to take the first step but, uh, that's gonna be easy.;;change49;high;reducing gambling;130;therapist;No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;131;client;Probably, um, [chuckles] cutting up the credit cards for a starter, and trying to restrain myself, and not to be led into temptation, I suppose, so.;;change49;high;reducing gambling;132;therapist;Okay.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;133;client;You know, if the pokies are at the pubs, just don't go to the pub. [chuckles];;change49;high;reducing gambling;134;therapist;Yeah, it's hard, isn't it? It's hard being in the pub thing, in that environment.;question;49;high;reducing gambling;135;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;136;therapist;We'd-we'd-we'd have an illustration for them, I suppose. We call those high-risk situations. You know, it's that-- so you might learn some language about some sort of the way that we describe-;therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;137;client;Mm. [chuckles];;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;138;therapist;-it and stuff, but, you know, being at the pub, you know, you want to sort of get the buzz of, you know, gambling, you know, horror situation, really easy to just go against what you decide that you wanted to do. Yeah?;therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;139;client;Mm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;140;therapist;Yeah? So how today have you sort of found some ways to manage that?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;141;client;Um, I haven't managed it to-to this point, so [chuckles] I don't know.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;142;therapist;Mm.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;143;client;Um, I suppose I've just got to get tougher with myself.;;change49;high;reducing gambling;144;therapist;Yeah. I think somewhat being tough with yourself, what-- yeah, people often say that, but, you know, it's not-- I think there are some things that you can do, and you've already-already identified a really good strategy.;therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;145;client;What? Cutting off some of my friendships?;;change49;high;reducing gambling;146;therapist;Well, it's a couple of ideas. O-one, thinking about who your friends are and will your friends support you to realize your dream of traveling to Egypt.;therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;147;client;Mm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;148;therapist;Um, and the other idea you talked about before was, actually, cutting up your credit cards. So kind of amazing what that thing makes there on different cards isn't it?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;149;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;150;therapist;It's very helpful and healthy. So, yeah, a couple of really good ideas already you've got, guess so?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;151;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;152;therapist;Yeah. So that's-that's some work that we can continue to work with. Yeah? Yeah?;other;49;high;reducing gambling;153;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;154;therapist;So 'cause-'cause I asked the question before, is what might be the hardest thing, and you'd identified that your friends, you know, could be one of the habits.;question;49;high;reducing gambling;155;client;Mm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;156;therapist;Yep, yep. Could that mean that some of your friends are probably moving around some similar sort of stuff like you, wondering about where they're going and-;question;49;high;reducing gambling;157;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;158;therapist;-what they want to further their dreams, yeah?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;159;client;Mm. Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;160;therapist;Okay, so we talked about sort of where things you-w-- Where you might be in five years and which path you wanna take, yep, yep? And you seemed very clear about it.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;161;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;162;therapist;Yeah, yeah. Something we can- we can do over the next while is-is really get some very concrete things in place to support you to do that.;therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;163;client;Yeah.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;164;therapist;Yeah. So what's one thing you can do between now and the next time we meet?;question;49;high;reducing gambling;165;client;Find the scissors. [laughs];;change49;high;reducing gambling;166;therapist;Yeah, find the scissors.;reflection;49;high;reducing gambling;167;client;Cut out the girls.;;change49;high;reducing gambling;168;therapist;Yeah, yeah, yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;169;client;Then, um, I don't know if the debts are still gonna be there or not but I-I've gotta find-;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;170;therapist;Yeah.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;171;client;-a way to pay them off and-;;change49;high;reducing gambling;172;therapist;Truly.;reflection;49;high;reducing gambling;173;client;-I don't know how I'm gonna do that.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;174;therapist;Yeah. Okay, so sounds like so-some budget to buy stuff will be helpful.;therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;175;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;176;therapist;Yeah, and of the things that-that we often put people in touch with here is some budget advice service, it's a great service here, um, and something that you can get to.;therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;177;client;Mm.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;178;therapist;So let's talk about how we can organize a-a meeting with them.;therapist_input;49;high;reducing gambling;179;client;Mm-hmm, that will be good.;;neutral49;high;reducing gambling;180;therapist;Okay.;other;49;high;reducing gambling;181;client;Yeah.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;client;So, uh, I guess the issue is that, um, you know, my doctor seems to think that my-my blood pressure's a little high, but I really don't think that there's a problem. And you know, I eat really well. Um. And, you know, she suggested that, um, I watch my caffeine but really, caffeine is not a problem for me.;;sustain50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;therapist;Okay. Um, but we were talking a little bit earlier-- earlier in our conversation, you had said that you did feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation. So it's a little bit of, I'm not sure of what-- Um, so where are we? Did-did you-- do you feel like you do have some agitation out of coffee, or is it just no problem at all?;reflection;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;client;Well, you know, sometimes it makes me a little jittery and, you know, I have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of my co-workers, but-- And-and working, um, in the hospital, they don't really look so highly on-on going the bathroom frequently. But you know, it-it keeps me awake, it keeps me aware, it-it makes me more able to like, you know, do my job better. And so I really don't see that it's a-it's a real issue.;;sustain50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;therapist;Yeah.;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;client;Um, you know, and-and-- I mean, maybe my blood pressure is a little high, but—;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;therapist;Yeah. So let me see if I had this. So y- so you got some positives, the-the awareness, and then you feel kinda on your game?;reflection;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;therapist;Um, and then there's some negatives with, um, you know, your-your co-workers, um, that they don't, you know-- then your boss may not want you, you know, checking out-;reflection;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;client;Right.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;therapist;-on the hospital floor, you know, for frequently.;reflection;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;client;Gotta stay on, yeah.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;therapist;Yeah, yeah, and then the blood pressure thing. Does that sound about right?;question;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;client;Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and sometimes, like I said, it does kind of make me a little jittery and, um, I don't know. I-I-I'm not- I'm not as happy and relaxed as I normally am. But you know, I-I really like it, and-and like I said, it makes me more aware of what's going on and-and I'm-- I-I feel like I'm much more observant.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;therapist;Yeah. How about frequency? Do you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking?;question;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;client;Yeah. I have about four cups a day.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;therapist;Okay. Okay. And that feels about right to you?;reflection;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;client;Yeah. I mean, I've-- I mean, it's the co-workers that-that work at night. Gosh, they bring in a carafe.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;client;And, uh, I-I can only imagine-;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;therapist;Yeah.;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;client;What-What their bodies are like.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;therapist;Yeah, yeah. What would happen if you-- if you looked at, maybe reducing that with that habit? Would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic?;therapist_input;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;client;Reducing it, like-- what do you mean?;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;therapist;The number. Just the number.;therapist_input;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;client;Yeah, yeah but, I mean, how-how much are we talking?;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;therapist;I don't-- you tell me. I mean, um, you're-you're drinking four a day.;therapist_input;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;therapist;Um--;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;client;You're probably-- you know, because I-I gotta have that morning cup, I really-- you know I really like waking up and-and that whole ritual. The, um-- you know, making the coffee and-;;sustain50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;therapist;Yeah.;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;client;I just really like the flavors.;;sustain50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;therapist;Yeah.;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;client;So I-I definitely don't want to give that up, but—;;sustain50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;therapist;I gotcha. Okay.;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;client;Uh—;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;therapist;So that one's important.;reflection;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;therapist;Yeah.;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;client;And then, of course, you know, working a 12-hour shift, I-I really think that, you know, the afternoon to keep me going until the evening is-is a really good idea too.;;sustain50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;therapist;Yeah.;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;client;I could probably get up the mid-morning.;;change50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;41;therapist;I think that's great.;therapist_input;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;client;Yeah, yeah, yeah.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;43;therapist;I think so. So you've identified one of the four that might-- you might be willing to-to try-;reflection;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;44;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;therapist;for a while to-to let go of. What do you- What do you think of that?;question;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;46;client;I think that does sound all right.;;change50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;47;therapist;Okay.;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;48;client;Yeah.;;neutral50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;49;therapist;Good.;other;50;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;50;client;I think I could do that.;;change51;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Tell me what you know about the flu shot?;question;51;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Uh, well, I know the flu can be pretty bad, but I'm in pretty good health, so I don't really feel like I need it. Uh, it's kind of just more for old people, right?;;sustain51;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Mm, um, so you're thinking it's really just for people who are-are vulnerable to illness?;reflection;51;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral51;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Would it be okay if I shared a little more information with you about the flu vaccine and the importance of it?;question;51;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Okay.;;neutral51;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;So you're right that you're young and healthy and you don't have a lot of complicating illnesses that mean that you would probably do okay if you got the flu. But we do know that the elderly are more at risk, pregnant people, babies are at risk of having serious complications from the flu, and by you getting the vaccine, that helps prevent you from passing it on to other people.;therapist_input;51;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Okay.;;neutral51;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;So having shared that information with you, how do you feel about the idea of the flu vaccine?;question;51;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Well, my grandparents probably wouldn't handle the flu very well-;;neutral51;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Mm.;other;51;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;and my co-worker is pregnant too.;;neutral51;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;51;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;So-so, yeah, I guess, I should, uh, get it for their sake.;;change51;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;Okay, so you've got some people in your life who are vulnerable to possible illness, and making this decision to get the flu shot will help protect them.;reflection;51;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, Laura. So, thanks for coming in. I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about. So, basically, I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester. And we're going to talk about, you know, whatever's kind of going on in your life. I'll ask you some questions about, you know, your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things. And then we'll talk a little bit about, you know, different behaviors and-and stuff like that. And so, it's-it's pretty casual, pretty informal, just sort of a chance for me to get to know you if that's all right.;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Okay. Why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Okay. Um, my name is Laura and I'm 17 and I'm a senior in high school.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay. And what do you like to do for fun?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Um, mostly just hang out with my friends and stuff on the weekends, things like that.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Mm-hmm, and when you and your friends are hanging out, and what- what do you do? Do you go to football games, go to parties?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Uh, yeah, if it's school-related, maybe like a game or two, or go to the mall, like, to shop or go to the movies or something, and at night, maybe like a party or something if someone's throwing.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. And what kind of hobbies do you have?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, I like to read and I like to go outside and, like, take walks and, like, hike and stuff. I'm very outdoorsy, so-;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Oh, cool. What are your plans for after high school?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Well, I plan to apply to college and maybe, you know, have a good career and something like that, hopefully.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;That's great. What do you think you'll study?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Well, I'm-I'm looking at the journalism, maybe pre-law.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Oh, neat.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;-which is a little different, but-;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Yeah, that's great. That's a really good goal.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah. Thanks.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;It's, uh, hard work to get into law school. Are you doing well in school? What kind of grades do you get?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm getting mostly A's and B's, so I'm pretty good, I'm okay.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Okay. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Um, I think all my grades are A's and B's, so, yeah.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Okay. And do you know where you're going to apply to college?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Um, I'm not sure yet, but I'm looking into schools like in the area, so maybe, I don't know, maybe I'll leave home or something.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay. Cool. And, you know, what made you decide maybe law school or-or journalism?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Um, well, I'm definitely not a math or science person, so I started off by there that I started looking at careers that maybe I would like. So-;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay. Great. Sounds like you have, like I said, really good goals and you're working hard in school. Um, you said that when you're going out with your friends, you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties, so do you drink alcohol?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Um, not really. Maybe one or two drinks at a party at the most.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Okay. And how often do you think you drink?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Um, maybe like once or twice a month at the most.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Mm-hmm, so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol?;reflection;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Yeah.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Okay, and so that's maybe like 20 times a year.;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Possibly, yeah.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;So that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then?;reflection;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Yeah, I guess you can say that.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay. What do you think is the most you've ever had?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Um, just two drinks at a party at the most. I don't-- I don't like to drink a lot. I don't-- Getting drunk is not something that appeals to me. So, I just have, like, a drink in my hand, so my friends won't bug me about not drinking. It's just like to look like I'm actually doing something. Most of- a lot of the time, I don't even drink at all. So-;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;But you've been drunk before?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Um, no, not really, maybe tipsy, but not like drunk.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;Okay. Um, so the most you've ever, ever had is two drinks in a day.;reflection;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Okay. Interesting. So, do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, yeah, yeah.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Okay. Um, so one of the things that, you know, is really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving. So, um, you know, that's actually a really big problem. And even around here, we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident. So that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing, all right? Have you ever done that? Have you ever gotten in the car-;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;No, I have drunk-driven and never got in a car with a drunk driver.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Okay. Uh, how much do your friends drink?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Um, I mean, I have some friends that drink some more than others, like, my close group of friends don't really drink as much because I'm not really interested in that, but I know that there are people that drink a lot more.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Okay. What about at these parties you're going to, are there other kids there who are drinking a lot?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Yeah. There are kids that drink a lot more than I do. Definitely, yeah.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;And do you hang out with them?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Not really closely, like, I know who they are and I'll say hi, but not-- They're not really, like, close friends of mine.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Mm-hmm, so, you know, even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Um, yeah. That makes sense.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Yeah, so, there, I mean, a lot of the other dangers of drinking, like, um, not just car accidents, but you can have other accidents, you know, people, um, you know, will fall or, um, you know, break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and falling down or, you know, as a girl, it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted.;therapist_input;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Yeah.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;You know, especially if you've been drinking, then, you know, you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you. Did- have you thought about that?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah, yeah, I have. That's, uh, one of the main reasons that I don't like to drink that much.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;So-;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;And then, um, you know, people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too. Um, also, you know, there have been a lot of kids, even at this school, who've gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook-;therapist_input;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yeah.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;And then their parents find out or the school finds out and, you know, we have a no-tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol, and really can get you into trouble, and it could put your whole college career in jeopardy. Have you thought about that?;therapist_input;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Yeah. Definitely, yeah.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;But you're still drinking.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Um, yeah, I mean, I guess it's the thing to do at a party, so-;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Uh-huh. So, I mean, do you think it's the thing to do if you wanna be an attorney?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Um, definitely not. That's why I don't try to drink that much. Just-;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;-make it look like I am, kind of.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. Hmm. So, I mean, I guess what we need to do then is kinda talk about some goals for how to be-;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;Okay.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;safer.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;Okay.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;Um, obviously, you shouldn't be drinking at all. Um, what do you think about that?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;I definitely agree. I know that there are some other risks involved in alcohol, they are the ones you mentioned, like, health-wise and things like that, so, I agree that alcohol may not be the best thing.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, do you think you can quit?;therapist_input;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Um, yeah, I mean, it's not, like, a really big part of my life, so.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;Okay. So, I'm going to write down then that you've decided to quit.;therapist_input;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;Okay.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;And, um, that's gonna be your goal, and that's great, you know, that's really why we're here, is to talk about that and-and make sure that you come to that decision. Um, so, I guess, can you quit this weekend then?;therapist_input;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;Yeah, yeah, definitely. I'll just not have a drink.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Okay, and then what about your friends who are still drinking?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;Um, I really can't control what they do, but I'll definitely try to get my closest friends to maybe stop like I will.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;Okay, and-and what if they won't?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Well, then, I guess, I'll just try to hang around them less or something. I'll try to find things for us to do that don't involve alcohol like a party or anything.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Yeah. Probably if your friends won't quit drinking, you should just find new friends.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Okay.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;'Cause, you know, the problem is if they're drinking, they're gonna pressure you into drinking and then you're gonna feel awkward and, you know, you're gonna be stuck and-and not know what to do and really you'd just be better off probably without them. If they're- if they're the kind of people who are gonna keep drinking-;reflection;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;Yeah.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;-they're probably not a good influence.;reflection;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;Okay, yeah.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;Um, and then, then you'll be better set for college too because, you know, the issue is you're getting good grades now, but when you get to college, it's a lot harder and, you know, if you're needing really good grades to get into law school, which you will need, then you really can't be distracted by alcohol.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;Okay, yeah, definitely.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;Okay, so, um, that's great 'cause it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you. Um, let's see. I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;They would be pretty upset. Yeah. They don't really condone alcohol use.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;So-;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;Okay, so, yeah, just another reason why you probably need to just quit then. Um, okay, yeah. I-- Okay, so, like I said, I'm gonna right down here that you've decided to quit and, um, uh, you know, I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably in the next semester sometime, so we can kinda check-in and-and make sure that, you know, that's still going well-;therapist_input;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;Okay.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;-and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking. Um, is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here?;therapist_input;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Um, no, no. I think I'm good.;;change53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Okay. Um, any questions or anything-;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;Uh, no.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;like that?;question;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;I have no questions.;;neutral53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;Okay. You're sure? Okay. All right. Um, well, that's probably it then. You can, uh, head back to class and-and thanks for coming in.;other;53;low;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;Okay, thanks.;;neutral54;high;managing life;0;therapist;Oh, hello Scott.;other;54;high;managing life;1;client;Hi.;;neutral54;high;managing life;2;therapist;Um, we were talking a little bit earlier, and you said you wanted to talk about exercising.;reflection;54;high;managing life;3;client;I do.;;change54;high;managing life;4;therapist;What's going on with that?;question;54;high;managing life;5;client;Well, I just can't seem to get back in the gym. I don't wanna-- I-I used to work out quite a bit, and in the last, I dunno, couple of years I've just-- I stopped going. I got busy, and now I'm out of the habit, and I-I really, I dunno, I feel like I need to get back.;;change54;high;managing life;6;therapist;Well, I mean, I think you just need to maybe sit down and write down a list of reasons why you need to get back to the gym, and then on the other side of the list, put down, you know, um, ideas about what's going to help you get there.;therapist_input;54;high;managing life;7;client;Okay. Um. All right. Um—;;neutral54;high;managing life;8;therapist;What gym do you belong to?;question;54;high;managing life;9;client;Uh, I belong to the-the Sport Fitness Center.;;neutral54;high;managing life;10;therapist;Okay. And-and how far away is it from your house?;question;54;high;managing life;11;client;Just a couple of miles.;;neutral54;high;managing life;12;therapist;Just a couple of miles. Mm. So you-- you know, you could, like, ride your bike or walk there, and it would be [unintelligible 00:01:12] too.;therapist_input;54;high;managing life;13;client;If I walked that far, I probably wouldn't even need to go to the gym, right?;;neutral54;high;managing life;14;therapist;Well, I don't know about that. Um. That-- you know, it's really important that you get your, um, not just your cardiovascular-- that's a good idea for the cardiovascular, but also, you know, your, um, weightlifting, the [inaudible 00:01:32] [crosstalk];therapist_input;54;high;managing life;15;client;[inaudible 00:01:33] training.;;neutral54;high;managing life;16;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;54;high;managing life;17;client;It-it-it would be important.;;change54;high;managing life;18;therapist;Yeah. So why-why do you want to-- what do you wanna do with that? You want to look different, or--?;question;54;high;managing life;19;client;Well, I-I-I-I would feel better. My-- I'd-I'd be able to wear more my clothes. I've been growing around the middle and I'd like to, uh, you know, go back to where I was, you know, get into a 34, 36 waist, you know.;;change54;high;managing life;20;therapist;Okay.;other;54;high;managing life;21;client;I-I'm more comfortable-- I feel better. I think that's the main thing.;;change54;high;managing life;22;therapist;Okay. Yeah, because your-your health really, to me, it's more important than your-your looks. I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand what you're saying, but, you know, it'd be great to get back in those jeans, but—;therapist_input;54;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah, yeah. It-it-it-- I-I am- I'm not getting any younger than I [unintelligible 00:02:18];;change54;high;managing life;24;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, I think you know what to do. You've done it before.;reflection;54;high;managing life;25;client;Yeah.;;change54;high;managing life;26;therapist;Yeah. Just a matter-- You just gotta do it.;therapist_input;54;high;managing life;27;client;I've gotta make time.;;change54;high;managing life;28;therapist;Yeah.;other;54;high;managing life;29;client;I've gotta make time.;;change54;high;managing life;30;therapist;Yeah. And so that might mean, you know, like giving up an hour's sleep, getting up an hour earlier in the day, and going there and getting it done then. That's what I do.;therapist_input;54;high;managing life;31;client;Yeah. Okay.;;neutral54;high;managing life;32;therapist;Yeah.;other;54;high;managing life;33;client;All right.;;neutral54;high;managing life;34;therapist;So when I see you next time, you know, that's what I'd like you to do is to, uh, experiment with getting up an hour earlier and, um-- You know, 'cause, uh, getting healthier is more important than sleep, you know. I mean, I know sleep is important, but-- And then bring that list back that we talked about.;therapist_input;54;high;managing life;35;client;Okay.;;neutral54;high;managing life;36;therapist;Okay?;other;54;high;managing life;37;client;Okay.;;neutral54;high;managing life;38;therapist;All right, so I'll see you next week.;other;54;high;managing life;39;client;Okay. Very good. Thanks.;;neutral54;high;managing life;40;therapist;All right. All right. Bye.;other;56;high;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Mrs. Smith. I'm Denise. I'm the social worker here at the clinic work that's working with Dr. Fields and the rest of the team. And, um, I know you were here to see Dr. Fields today, and I-I just wanted to let you know, I usually work with people who are similar to- have situations similar to you, and that have gone back home from rehab. And, uh, so I'd like to find out a little bit if you would, if that's okay, about how it's been going since you got home.;question;56;high;managing life;1;client;Pretty good.;;neutral56;high;managing life;2;therapist;Yeah?;other;56;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah. Um, I'm glad to be there.;;neutral56;high;managing life;4;therapist;Yeah. What are you really glad about?;question;56;high;managing life;5;client;Uh, well, I'm glad to see my dog, he's very cute, and it just feels good to be home.;;neutral56;high;managing life;6;therapist;Yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;7;client;Yeah. And my garden is coming along, and my neighbors have stuff-- It's-it's good. It's good to be home.;;neutral56;high;managing life;8;therapist;I know, I-I understand that it was really-- That was your goal. That was a really important thing for you to be able to get home and it sounds like you've been able to really en- enjoy parts of it, and I know you've been going to the- both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and how's-how's that going?;reflection;56;high;managing life;9;client;Well, um. I-I didn't get- go to physical therapy this week, and the- or Tai Chi, actually.;;neutral56;high;managing life;10;therapist;So, I'm wondering if something happened that that led you not to go. You look a little, um, down.;question;56;high;managing life;11;client;Yeah. Well, um. Actually, I-I had a little semi fall, I didn't fall down, I didn't fall down completely but I-I did-- I guess I still had the wobblies and I was hoping that the physical therapy and the Tai Chi would be- get me further along than it has, and I-I still don't have the balance. So, I'm thinking that maybe I was pushing too hard, that maybe I should cut back, you know, and kind of not try so hard to-to keep moving like that.;;sustain56;high;managing life;12;therapist;Mm. So you've been working really hard-;reflection;56;high;managing life;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;14;therapist;-through this whole thing, you worked really hard to get home.;reflection;56;high;managing life;15;client;Yes.;;neutral56;high;managing life;16;therapist;And you- you've continued to work really hard with both the physical therapy and the Tai Chi and taking care of your house and doing all those things.;reflection;56;high;managing life;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;18;therapist;And you had this fall or semi-fall, and you're feeling like maybe- maybe you were pushing too hard?;reflection;56;high;managing life;19;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;20;therapist;Yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;21;client;So I'm-I'm-I cut back, and I-I don't know if I should really even continue the Tai Chi because it's-it's very demanding.;;sustain56;high;managing life;22;therapist;Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of work.;reflection;56;high;managing life;23;client;Uh, it's beautiful and-and- but, um, yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;24;therapist;What are you concerned about?;question;56;high;managing life;25;client;That I'll- that I'll fall again.;;sustain56;high;managing life;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;56;high;managing life;27;client;I'll really fall and hurt myself, and this way, if I don't move around so much, there's less chance that I will.;;sustain56;high;managing life;28;therapist;Yeah, yeah, yeah. And- so you don't want to hurt yourself.;reflection;56;high;managing life;29;client;No.;;neutral56;high;managing life;30;therapist;And what are- what are your concerns about-- It doesn't sound like you-you feel like you hurt yourself in this fall.;question;56;high;managing life;31;client;No, I didn't- it was just more scary, and it was like a-a signal that maybe I'm doing too much.;;sustain56;high;managing life;32;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;56;high;managing life;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;34;therapist;Yeah. And, what are you concerned will happen if-if you get hurt or if something-;question;56;high;managing life;35;client;Well, yeah, if I- if I lose my balance and fall down, I could- anything, you know, really get hurt, and then-then I wouldn't be able to be home anymore, and that's not what I want. I want to stay home. So I want to do what I have to do to-to-to stay home.;;sustain56;high;managing life;36;therapist;And it feels like the only way that you can really stay safe and not fall is to not do anything to kind of just hunker down.;reflection;56;high;managing life;37;client;Yeah. [laughs] Yes, you've put it very well, hunker down-;;neutral56;high;managing life;38;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;39;client;Watch the TV and pet my dog. I-I, you know, not to that extreme, but yeah, I think- I think maybe, um, yeah, I was-was going- pushing too hard.;;sustain56;high;managing life;40;therapist;Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.;other;56;high;managing life;41;client;And I'm not sure about the Tai Chi anymore. I-I think the physical therapy, I can understand that, but I'm not so sure about the Tai Chi.;;sustain56;high;managing life;42;therapist;Yeah. So the physical therapy is can- you can kind of still see that it's helping you to build your strength, which-;reflection;56;high;managing life;43;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;44;therapist;might have probably helped you break your fall this time.;reflection;56;high;managing life;45;client;Right, right.;;neutral56;high;managing life;46;therapist;Um, I'm wondering what you remember about what-what Dr. Fields said about the Tai Chi in relationship to falls. Did she talk with you about that?;question;56;high;managing life;47;client;She did. Sh-- Yeah, that's right, that's right. She said that they did studies and that they found that it was really preventative. I think she's- I forget the-the percentage, but yeah, she was really enthusiastic and she does it herself.;;neutral56;high;managing life;48;therapist;Yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;50;therapist;"Yeah. So you're feeling a little betrayed like it didn't-- ""Look, and I did this, I was doing my Tai Chi, and all of a sudden, I- here, look at this, I fall.""";reflection;56;high;managing life;51;client;"That's a strong word, isn't it, ""betrayed"". Um, wow. A little, but-but I-I know, I know that it's true. I mean, my friend who does Tai Chi, she just- she loves it. Maybe it's just not for me, you know.";;sustain56;high;managing life;52;therapist;Right.;other;56;high;managing life;53;client;But, um-;;neutral56;high;managing life;54;therapist;So you're just starting to question a little bit about whether or not it might be what is useful and, you know, it-it does really come down to what works for you and what-wh-what you decide will help you stay safe. And I'd like to work with you as I know Dr. Fields would, to-to help build a plan that will help you feel as safe as you can in your home-;reflection;56;high;managing life;55;client;Right.;;neutral56;high;managing life;56;therapist;and to keep you there and to keep you feeling safe.;reflection;56;high;managing life;57;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;58;therapist;Wh-what do you think about that?;question;56;high;managing life;59;client;Absolutely, that- because I don't- now I'm-I'm feeling-;;neutral56;high;managing life;60;therapist;Yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;61;client;-really a little frightened that what if- what if I fall down and-and-and nobody comes around and I'm lying there for two days, you know. I may have heard about that.;;sustain56;high;managing life;62;therapist;Yeah, right.;other;56;high;managing life;63;client;So, um, 'cause I am alone.;;neutral56;high;managing life;64;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;65;client;So—;;neutral56;high;managing life;66;therapist;So it really kinda strikes you that you're- that you're there alone and this could happen and--;reflection;56;high;managing life;67;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;68;therapist;What thoughts do you have about that? What have you heard that others have done, or what are- what are- what thoughts do you have?;question;56;high;managing life;69;client;Well, the-- I think that there's some things that could be done to-- I know people who live in-in residence, they have a cord they can pull, but how do they get to the cord? Um, is there any- anything else that I could do just to communicate if-if-;;neutral56;high;managing life;70;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;71;client;if something does happen?;;neutral56;high;managing life;72;therapist;Yeah, yeah. I know what's worked for a lot of the-the folks that I've worked with is there's like- it's called a lifeline and they can wear it around their neck and it's hooked up and- so that if you need help, you can push the button.;therapist_input;56;high;managing life;73;client;I think I saw something like that on TV.;;neutral56;high;managing life;74;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;56;high;managing life;75;client;Is it- does it really work?;;neutral56;high;managing life;76;therapist;It does really work.;therapist_input;56;high;managing life;77;client;'Cause you know that they sell so much stuff on TV, it's like you could- [crosstalk];;neutral56;high;managing life;78;therapist;Right. Right.;other;56;high;managing life;79;client;It's crazy, it's crazy.;;neutral56;high;managing life;80;therapist;No, it is something that there's a couple of different of, uh, you know, a couple of different products out there, but it-it does- it can really help, uh, and-and it kind of gives- might give you this sense of security that you have at your fingertips.;therapist_input;56;high;managing life;81;client;Yeah. I guess so, feeling a little scared-;;neutral56;high;managing life;82;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;56;high;managing life;83;client;-you know, about that happening and-;;neutral56;high;managing life;84;therapist;Yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;85;client;So, yeah, it's probably a signal to-to make some-some changes.;;change56;high;managing life;86;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;56;high;managing life;87;client;Like I don't wanna go back to the hospital, right? I really don't. Do I have to?;;change56;high;managing life;88;therapist;We- we're gonna work with you to help you stay home as long as you possibly can and be safe.;therapist_input;56;high;managing life;89;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;90;therapist;So what do you think that will take, um, because you're the one that really knows how you're feeling about in the house and how you're feeling about your safety. What do you think? The lifeline is a possibility, that's something you can consider.;question;56;high;managing life;91;client;That I will definitely- I definitely wanna do that.;;change56;high;managing life;92;therapist;Mm.;other;56;high;managing life;93;client;I definitely wanna do that.;;change56;high;managing life;94;therapist;Mm-hmm. What else do you think it would take for you to feel safe?;question;56;high;managing life;95;client;Well, I- maybe they-they-- When I first came home, they had somebody come and show me some things in-in the house, but maybe a refresher of that, and they told me that I should exercise and-and, um, I guess I could-- Maybe support, maybe I'm looking for-for maybe a buddy or something, some way that I could be reminded. I'm feeling a little, you know, I was moving along and things were feeling more positive, it's sort of like two steps forward and-;;change56;high;managing life;96;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;97;client;-one step back, but now it's to step forward and three steps back. [laughs];;neutral56;high;managing life;98;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;56;high;managing life;99;client;So, um, is there, yeah, like a support somehow? My daughter is very good and she calls me, but you know, she-she lives in Seattle, she lives-;;change56;high;managing life;100;therapist;Yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;101;client;far away.;;neutral56;high;managing life;102;therapist;Yeah.;other;56;high;managing life;103;client;So- and I don't wanna impose on my neighbors or my friends.;;neutral56;high;managing life;104;therapist;So you'd like to have a little bit more support-;reflection;56;high;managing life;105;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral56;high;managing life;106;therapist;-and a little bit more connection maybe that-;reflection;56;high;managing life;107;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;108;therapist;-that-that, um, that has to happen. Would you like some suggestions about that?;question;56;high;managing life;109;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;110;therapist;Um, so one of the things that- that we also have here, we-we have- we can get some case- what they call case management services and that might be someone who comes in and checks with you at home and helps you figure out some of the things that might need to be done like you were talking about, give you a little refresher on safety at home-;therapist_input;56;high;managing life;111;client;Right.;;neutral56;high;managing life;112;therapist;-and, uh, and-and also might help you organize and connect up with other services that might be out there or do things, um, like that. I don't know. What it- how does that sound to you?;question;56;high;managing life;113;client;Yeah, that would be good. Do you think I should try to go back to the Tai Chi?;;change56;high;managing life;114;therapist;Yes. I was going to say the other thing that I would say- that I would consider because the senior center, and I know you were really active in the senior center before-;therapist_input;56;high;managing life;115;client;Yes, great place.;;neutral56;high;managing life;116;therapist;-and I'm wondering if you feel like there's support there. They have a lot of activities going on at the senior center that- and I- and I don't know what was in the Tai Chi included that might be- not only serve the purpose of the exercise but really help;therapist_input;56;high;managing life;117;client;Yeah. I guess I've kind of gone to the extreme. I tend to do that. [chuckles] Yeah. So, keep moving?;;change56;high;managing life;118;therapist;Yeah. It sounds so crazy, doesn't it? Like the- it- when it feels like inside, what you're- what I'm hearing from you is that it feels like inside like moving is unsafe.;reflection;56;high;managing life;119;client;Yeah.;;neutral56;high;managing life;120;therapist;And-and yet, we know we can't make perfect safety, but we know that the more you move and the more active that you stay, the less likely it is that you're going to fall and the more safe you're going to be.;therapist_input;56;high;managing life;121;client;Really?;;neutral56;high;managing life;122;therapist;Yes.;other;56;high;managing life;123;client;Oh, okay.;;neutral56;high;managing life;124;therapist;Can't prevent all of it-;therapist_input;56;high;managing life;125;client;Uh-huh.;;neutral56;high;managing life;126;therapist;but we can make it less likely.;therapist_input;56;high;managing life;127;client;Okay. Okay. Okay. I-I'm willing to start again, so to speak.;;change56;high;managing life;128;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;56;high;managing life;129;client;Yeah. It's scary.;;sustain56;high;managing life;130;therapist;Yeah. Takes a lot. Takes a lot. And you're the only one that'll- that can know what it is you're willing to work through that fear for.;other;56;high;managing life;131;client;Well, I'm willing to work through my fears and difficulties to be in my little house with my little dog and my little garden. I've been there for- since my husband and I got married, and that's where we lived, and I don't want to give it up yet.;;change56;high;managing life;132;therapist;Mm-hmm.

I'm a truck driver and I haul those heavy boxes in on the dollies and I just can't afford that, so you know.;;sustain57;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;So your-your-your doctor told you that if your cholesterol remains elevated, you're at risk of stroke or heart attack?;therapist_input;57;low;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Yeah, down the line, but-;;sustain57;low;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;Okay. Well, the-the side effect is something that's very, very rare, it's not really something you need to worry about, and the risk of stroke or heart attack is much worse.;therapist_input;57;low;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Well, right now it's the muscle weakness that-that I'm concerned about, and that's, uh, you know, that's the present, uh, I've got to do my job.;;sustain57;low;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Well, I-I-I understand that.

Yeah, it won't get to the blood- it won't get to the point where it affects your job—;therapist_input;57;low;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;Well, you know- why don't you just give me the medicine, I'll take it home and I'll think about it? But you know, I'm worried about my job.;;sustain57;low;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;You- you really need to take it, and-and like I said, the-the muscle weakness is rare.

I'm not making much sense, but I do.;;change61;high;adhering to medical procedure;58;therapist;Uh-huh.

Why don't you fill me in on what's been going on since I saw you last?;question;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;Um, I guess everything's fine. I think my caseworker mentioned something about community service that I have to do or something. I don't know.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;Okay.;other;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;I'm not sure of that.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;So she talked to you a little bit about it, but it sounds like you're kind of unsure exactly the details.;reflection;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;Yeah, I know that she said I have to get so many hours in, but I don't- I don't know. I kind of was half-listening.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;Okay. So why don't you tell me what you remember from having your conversation with your case manager? What do you know so far about community service?;question;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;I know that I have to get it done by the end of my probation, except I forgot like how many hours or if I'm supposed to find it or someone else is gonna find it for me or I-I told you I'm confused.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;Okay, gotcha. So, you know, that it needs to get done-;reflection;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;therapist;Yes.-you know, you have till the end of your probation-;reflection;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;client;Yes.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;therapist;-but you're a little fuzzy on the details.;reflection;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;client;Exactly, yeah.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;therapist;Okay. Um, so maybe if it's okay with you, I can share with you some of, um, the requirements, maybe go over the details a little bit more.;other;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;therapist;Is that all right?;other;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;therapist;Okay, great. Um, so with your community service I know you've got 25 hours left to do, um, so that does need to get done by the end of your probation, and your case manager is a really great resource to help you find a place where you can do it. So I know in the past some clients have done their community service at food pantries or shelters, or anywhere in the community that's not, you know, a family member or a friend. Um, the urban ecology center is a really great place. You can kind of work outside, work with younger kids. Do any of those options seem like a fit that you might be interested in?;therapist_input;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;client;Um, yeah, I just, so I still have to find the community service hours myself?;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;therapist;So that's something that you can work with your case manager on.;therapist_input;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;client;Okay.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;therapist;So, um, that's something you can absolutely ask her or quest- or me some questions about, but they'll be able to come and bring you some options-;therapist_input;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;client;Okay.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;therapist;-of places that you can work with, some phone numbers to call.;therapist_input;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;client;Okay.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;therapist;And that is something that we'd kinda like to see you do on your own, but if you're really feeling like you're struggling, those are phone calls that either you and I can make together or you and your case manager can make together.;therapist_input;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;client;Okay, so I would do that. And then do you know, can I get all the 24 hours in in like a weekend or how does that work?;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;therapist;Well, I mean, 24 hours in a weekend sounds to me like it might be a lot of time.;therapist_input;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;client;[unintelligible 00:02:20];;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;therapist;I can- I can hear that you are really eager to just get it finished-;reflection;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;client;Oh, yeah.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;therapist;-and get it out of the way. Maybe I know in the past it's been helpful for some other clients to sit down and take a calendar and just mark out, okay, I'm gonna do five hours this day, I'm gonna do three hours this day, two hours of this day. Does that so;therapist_input;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;client;Yeah, I think, just to keep track of it better.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;therapist;Okay.;other;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;client;I think it's a good idea.;;change62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;therapist;And then, you know, it might be, I definitely think that if you're committed and it's summer break, it's something you could easily get done in a week.;therapist_input;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;client;Okay.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;therapist;What other questions do you have for me about community service?;other;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;client;I think that's it. I think I was just worried about who was gonna do it for me, but I know I have to, I guess, do it myself and that 25 hours has to be done. It seems like that's the time I'd have to get done.;;change62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;41;therapist;Yup, absolutely.;other;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;client;Okay.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;43;therapist;But you know that if you have any more questions, you can always come to me or your case manager and we're here for- to be a support for you.;therapist_input;62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;44;client;All right, thank you.;;neutral62;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;therapist;You're welcome.;other;63;high;reducing drug use;0;therapist;So Tom, this infection is been pretty painful for you but we have antibiotics. If you take it faithfully for 10 days, I'm sure that your infection will be gone. Can you do that?;therapist_input;63;high;reducing drug use;1;client;Definitely.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;2;therapist;And do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;3;client;Okay.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;4;therapist;Let's take a look. It says that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do you use?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;5;client;I do some meth.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;6;therapist;Snort it, smoke it?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;7;client;Snort it, always snort it.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;8;therapist;Don't inject it?;reflection;63;high;reducing drug use;9;client;Mm-mm.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;10;therapist;Use any other drugs?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;11;client;Just, you know, some alcohol.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;12;therapist;And, uh, um, you do this how often?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;13;client;Meth?;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;63;high;reducing drug use;15;client;Um, two, three times a month.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;16;therapist;So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often?;reflection;63;high;reducing drug use;17;client;Right.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;18;therapist;Only snort it?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;19;client;Right.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;20;therapist;Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because people who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?;therapist_input;63;high;reducing drug use;21;client;Yeah, it could be because, uh, I was high when I had unprotected sex and I would not do that if I were not high.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;22;therapist;So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?;reflection;63;high;reducing drug use;23;client;Definitely, yeah.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;24;therapist;And it seems to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your judgment?;reflection;63;high;reducing drug use;25;client;Yeah.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;26;therapist;Anything else happening with Methamphetamine in your life? Is it affecting you in any way?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;27;client;No, I mean, no. I mean, like I said, I only do it in clubs, you know, with my friends, uh, two or three times a month at-at the most. Um, uh, I don't think it's really having other impacts. But I'm-I'm concerned about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;28;therapist;Yeah, you know, I'm concerned bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation.;therapist_input;63;high;reducing drug use;29;client;I-I understand but it's I think that would be a hard thing for me to do. You know, I mean, I know I should but, I mean, that's like my whole social life. You know, I mean, all my friends go to these clubs. That's where- that's where I see them. You know, that's my sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. You know, I mean, everyone is doing it there. You know, so it's while I would like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away.;;sustain63;high;reducing drug use;30;therapist;So you recognize Methamphetamine has some problems associated with it and you also on the balance see that a lot of your social life and your sex life involves Methamphetamine, it would be difficult to quit using?;reflection;63;high;reducing drug use;31;client;Yeah, I don't think it would be easy but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;32;therapist;Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine completely-;question;63;high;reducing drug use;33;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;34;therapist;-with zero being not ready at all-;question;63;high;reducing drug use;35;client;Mm.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;36;therapist;-and 10 being ready, where would you put yourself?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;37;client;Uh, three.;;sustain63;high;reducing drug use;38;therapist;Why not a one or a two?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;39;client;I mean, this has been really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is a really bad experience. And, uM, I know I don't think the same, you know, when I'm- when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. So that scares me a lot. That's why it's higher than a one or two.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;40;therapist;Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;41;client;Well, I do just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you know. It could be really bad, um, if it was cut with something dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about that sometimes.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;42;therapist;Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV.;reflection;63;high;reducing drug use;43;client;Yeah.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;44;therapist;Um, what do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;45;client;Something else to do on weekends, you know, different social life.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;46;therapist;How could you get a different social life?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;47;client;It's the hard thing, I mean, almost everybody I know uses it.;;sustain63;high;reducing drug use;48;therapist;Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;49;client;My sister.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;50;therapist;Does she-- Have you talked to her about your meth use?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;51;client;I haven't really talked to her about it. I think she knows it I do it sometimes. I mean, we're pretty close. I think I could talk to her about it, and I think she would probably help.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;52;therapist;So on the one hand, it would be difficult to quit using Methamphetamine because there are so many positives that you get from using it. But on the other, there are reasons why you want to quit using methamphetamine.;reflection;63;high;reducing drug use;53;client;Yes.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;54;therapist;And there's some things that you might be able to do that would make it easier to not use methamphetamine including talking to your sister and getting some support.;reflection;63;high;reducing drug use;55;client;Yes.;;change63;high;reducing drug use;56;therapist;Well, great. I recommend that you not use Methamphetamine at all but what you do is up to you.;therapist_input;63;high;reducing drug use;57;client;Okay.;;neutral63;high;reducing drug use;58;therapist;I could see you again in a month. Would that work out for you?;question;63;high;reducing drug use;59;client;Yeah, sure.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;0;therapist;Well, welcome, Ricky.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;1;client;Thank you.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;2;therapist;Nice to meet you.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;3;client;Yeah, you too.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;4;therapist;And you found us okay?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;5;client;Yeah.

Okay. Alright. Well, um, I know a little about why you're here today-;other;64;high;reducing drug use;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;14;therapist;-um, but it's great to see you, and so maybe a good point to start with is, tell me why you're here.;question;64;high;reducing drug use;15;client;"Sure. Um, I guess, you know, maybe two or three weeks ago, I had sort of like this group of friends come around to my place, and um, you know, they-they were sort of saying that it was just like a night to hang out and watch DVDs and stuff, and then they sort of sat me down and were like, ""You know, maybe you need to get a bit of help for, you know, drug stuff."" Then, you know, I was sort of like, ""Well, mm.""

I just sort of did a bit of search on the internet and stuff and just read about this place, so I just thought I'll—;;change64;high;reducing drug use;22;therapist;Right. So it sounds like you thought there was something that, uh, that you needed to look at, something that was concerning you?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;23;client;Yeah, I guess. I-I suppose I hadn't really thought about it till they sat me down, and you know- I mean I could, uh, I could understand a little bit of where they were coming from, so yeah, I thought I'd—;;change64;high;reducing drug use;24;therapist;They were concerned for you?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;26;therapist;Alright.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;27;client;Yeah. Yeah, which kind of was a bit of a sh-shock, I suppose.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;28;therapist;You were surprised?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;29;client;"Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, you know, I don't know. You know, you see on movies when people sort of intervene or say, ""You know, you need to go and get help."" And then-- I don't know.

Like, I-I would-- l didn't think I was at anywhere near a point that I would need to be sat down and intervened with-;;sustain64;high;reducing drug use;36;therapist;Okay.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;37;client;if you know What I mean.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;38;therapist;Alright.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;39;client;I suppose.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;40;therapist;I'm trying to understand you so far, something's concerning you and something's concerning your friends-;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;41;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;42;therapist;-but you're not sure whether it's- whether-- just how bad it is or- and you're just wanting to check that out?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;43;client;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause, I mean, you know, they are my friends and-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;45;client;- you know, I'm not gonna be so narrow-minded as to say for sure that, you know, they're entirely wrong 'cause there's a big group of them, you know?

But on the other ha;;change64;high;reducing drug use;46;therapist;Yeah.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;47;client;-and just check it up, yep.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;48;therapist;Because they care about you and-and you respect what they say, and you're wondering whether something about what they're saying may be right, but let's check that out a bit?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;49;client;Yeah, pretty right.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;50;therapist;Alright.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;51;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;52;therapist;Well, let's do some checking out.;therapist_input;64;high;reducing drug use;53;client;Okay, cool.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;54;therapist;So tell me a little bit about what you're doing, what is- what is the concern that they are raising.;therapist_input;64;high;reducing drug use;55;client;Um, dr-drugs, I guess.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;56;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;57;client;Mm, yeah. Sort of kind of do a bit of P now and again-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;58;therapist;Alright.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;59;client;-and, um, I guess less often, I do a bit of, you know, I smoke a little bit and, um, party pills in the- in the weekend sometimes.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;60;therapist;Okay.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;61;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;62;therapist;Tell me a little bit about what now and again means, and-and-and how often.;question;64;high;reducing drug use;63;client;Um, a couple of times a week maybe.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;64;therapist;Is this- is this with, uh, with the drug?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;65;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;66;therapist;This is meth you're talking about? A couple of times a week?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;67;client;Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. So I guess when I put it that way, it does sound quite a lot, but it doesn't feel a lot, you know? If you know what I mean?;;change64;high;reducing drug use;68;therapist;Well, maybe, we c-- we can check that out to see whether-whether it's a lot or-- But maybe also importantly to-to discuss with you what the effects are and-and-and what your concerns are about it. But help me to understand a little bit more of what it's like for you. Tell me- tell me what are the things about your, uh, use of meth that you- that you've liked that you found good for you?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;69;client;Right. Um, I suppose it's kind of hand-in-hand with just hanging out with, sort of, some new scene that I've-- Like, um, I moved to Auckland maybe three years ago.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;70;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;71;client;And, um, I still live in Palmy and, so as you can imagine, it's sort of a bit different down there. And, um, kind of just when I first got here I was sorta introduced a little bit to, um, like do you know Family Bar on-on [unintelligible 00:06:49]?;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;72;therapist;I know Family Bar, yes.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;73;client;"Yeah. It's that sort of- that sorta scene, that kind of, um, gay scene, I guess. And, like, it's not something I'd really thought about before and-- But then kinda hung out there and just met these people that were sort of like you don't really get there much Palmy. Well, I mean I suppose you do, but they're not-- You know, in Auckland bars like that you can just-- Uh, you can just be it out in the open, you know, and I suppose in Palmy you can't as easily. Um, so just to arrive and see that and kind of meet these people that were just really friendly, you know, and-and not judge me into it. I don't know. You know, Palmy often is they're sort of like, ""Oh, you've gotta own a car, and soap it up, and drive up and down the Main Street,"" and I just couldn't give a shit about that, you know, so. Or play rugby and, you know, that didn't interest me at all and sorta come here and have people, you know, talk about interesting stuff and have a good time. I just want to go out and dance and stuff like that. Um, that was quite cool for me to know that that existed because I hadn't seen that before and-and I suppose there's a lot of that that goes on there, you know?";;sustain64;high;reducing drug use;74;client;"It's quite a heavy party scene most weekends and stuff. So it kind of goes hand in hand with that really, and just, you know, I guess when I have-have a slight-- I don't know, you just feel really good, I guess. Just feel, like, happy, and excited, and just to be surrounded by people that, you know, really care about you, and love you and-- Coming from a place where y-you didn't-- don't get that as much, it's just really cool, you know, to-to be able to go, ""Okay, on this day I can take this."" And it's just that instant, like, ""I know- I know I'll feel good."" I guess that's part of it.";;sustain64;high;reducing drug use;75;therapist;So Auckland, coming to Auckland from Palmerston for you was-was like taking charge of something that you were going to look to make something different in your life?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;76;client;Yeah, in-in a way. Although I wouldn't have been conscious of that really. I just sort of discovered it here. It's not like I came to Auckland looking for that kinda-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;77;therapist;Right.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;78;client;-lift to get away from, um, you know parents mainly, and that kind of lifestyle, that Palmy sort of lifestyle. But then yeah, I discovered this other thing, um—;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;79;therapist;Which you weren't aware of in Palmerston?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;80;client;No.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;81;therapist;Okay.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;82;client;No. I didn't really know. I guess you see sort of things like that in-in movies from America you know, but you don't really-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;83;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;84;client;- think that it would exist in your own country. Well, not if you grew up in Palmy.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;85;therapist;Palmerston. Mm-hmm.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;86;client;Um, I don't mean to be mean about Palmy but, you know, it's just the different kinda attitude, I guess, kinda- this done-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;87;therapist;Yeah.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;88;client;to that sort of thing.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;89;therapist;It sounds like you're ready to move up to something that was different.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;90;client;Yes-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;91;therapist;And-and you came-;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;92;client;-plus-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;93;therapist;here to Auckland.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;94;client;Yeah, yeah. I definitely wanted to get away from something. I didn't know what too, but then I arrived here and found this thing that was like actually, this was obviously, fate or whatever was pulling me to this thing-;;sustain64;high;reducing drug use;95;therapist;Alright.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;96;client;-'cause-'cause like I found something in myself or something that was missing.;;sustain64;high;reducing drug use;97;therapist;And how does that feel for you now?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;98;client;"Um, now, I guess, now, I'm just a little used to it. [clears throat] When I first got here, I was like, ""Wow, this is amazing."" This is hard, I guess, but, you know, it's been three years now, so it's just kinda like I've gotten used to it.";;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;99;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;100;client;"I mean, I guess, I'm, let's say I take it for granted but, um, yes, it's just comfortable now. And, um, it's just a sort of what I do really. Yeah, so, I guess that the drugs are linked to that, I suppose. It's j-- Well, it's just a part of it, I don't really think-- I didn't really differentiate it. It's just kinda, ""Okay, I'm gonna go hang with my friends,"" and that sort of thing, you know, that Saturday, Friday night thing. And then it just happens really as part of that.";;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;101;therapist;So coming out, feeling-- being gay-;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;102;client;Yep.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;103;therapist;-being part of a gay culture here in Auckland, is feeling good-;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;104;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;105;therapist;for you?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;106;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;107;therapist;And at the same time, it's-it's linked closely with the- with the drug scene with the meth scene for you?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;108;client;Yep.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;109;therapist;And you're not experiencing where these two things are separate? They just seem to be together more often than not?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;110;client;Well, I guess, now, that I think about it, maybe it's sort of gone beyond that, maybe I didn't notice that.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;111;therapist;So—;other;64;high;reducing drug use;112;client;I mean like I always-- Well, it's, you know it's kind of a thing that happens in the weekends but, I guess, sometimes in the weekdays. You know, I'll-I'll pretty much every weekend I'll have a big night, um, maybe two but sometimes, you know, in the weekdays like on a Tuesday or Wednesday or something if I just kinda feel like doing something then I might do that sometimes to see if someone else wants to come round and join me or, you know, occasionally by myself I might have a smoke by myself or something like that. And I guess that isn't entirely linked to that scene, I suppose.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;113;therapist;It just sounds like something's worrying you about that there's-there's a part link there but there's not a link and that-that maybe that the drugs is-is becoming a more important part in your life.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;114;client;Mm. Maybe. I suppose I hadn't really thought about it-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;115;therapist;Okay.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;116;client;until recently.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;117;therapist;So something's changed recently?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;118;client;Yeah. I suppose just since that kind of intervention thing or I started to give them the benefit of the doubt. And it's-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;119;therapist;Yeah.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;120;client;-maybe noticing some things that I hadn't noticed but—;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;121;therapist;Tell me about those things you're noticing that you hadn't noticed before.;question;64;high;reducing drug use;122;client;Oh, I mean, e-even just now, you know, when you asked me how often.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;123;therapist;That surprised you?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;124;client;"Mm. S-surprised me to-to think about, you know, when there's stuff, and you don't really think about it, but then if someone asked you, you know, how often or-- and then you kind of have to quantify it, I suppose it kinda sound shocking, you know, if I- if I imagine myself sort of saying, ""I do this, you know, a few times a week."" It-it-";;change64;high;reducing drug use;125;therapist;Mm.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;126;client;-sounds shocking. But to me it-it's- it doesn't feel that way, you know, that's kind of where that, where it kind of doesn't sit right. I, [clears throat] that's why I kind of got a bit miffed at my friends a little bit, or I dunno, a bit defensive there.;;sustain64;high;reducing drug use;127;therapist;Alright.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;128;client;felt a bit weird.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;129;therapist;Okay.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;130;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;131;therapist;So you're worried a little bit about it and you're going to find out more about it, but you're-you're not gonna take on this notion of being a headache or anything as yet—;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;132;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;133;therapist;Okay.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;134;client;Definitely.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;135;therapist;So tell me then, um, Ricky, what- what's the other side of the good things that-that using meth or doing some smoking does for you? Is there a downside to it? Are there problems that you're experiencing?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;136;client;Yep. Um. Uh, I suppose money is quite a big thing. Like, I used to have a lot more money sorta last year. I had a, quite a good job, like a, quite a regular acting job.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;137;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;138;client;Um, and it was like quite a lot of money that la-last year. So it wasn't such a problem then. And I suppose I sort of blew that money a little bit. Um, so now I don't have that acting income coming in as frequently and I'm working in a cafe like a sort of part-time and it's not bringing in as much. So now it's kinda like, and sometimes I need to borrow a bit of money or sorta need a bit of help with the rent sometimes.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;139;therapist;Quite a lot's changed over the last year from—;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;140;client;Yeah. Yeah. A little bit.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;141;therapist;It doesn't sound like it was part of the plan.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;142;client;No. But you know, that's the life of an actor, I suppose, ups and downs works and not works.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;143;therapist;Sure. [chuckling] It's not a secure profession-;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;144;client;No.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;145;therapist;-and it's-it's hard-;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;146;client;It's not.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;147;therapist;-it's hard. But is-is there, I just wonder, is there a connection at all between the-the-the-the acting and the meth use in terms of the effect of the meth use on your- on your ability to get work?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;148;client;Hmm. Could have been a couple of auditions that I didn't do so well and as I could have 'cause of that.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;149;therapist;The drug may have had an effect on that?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;150;client;"Uh, maybe. Maybe it's just my general sort of state. Um,I dunno, sometimes I suppose just kind of weighs on my mind a little bit like, ""What am I doing or why am I spending my money on this?"" I mean, when it's happening, it's like, this is amazing.";;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;151;therapist;Hmm. Hmm.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;152;client;You know am I-- You go in- you go into places, interesting places, but you know, I could just as well have saved that money and actually gone to interesting places I suppose. But I don't know. I wonder if it- if-if it's having an effect. I-I don't know. I can't say for sure, but maybe it's not so good for the face, I dunno. [crosstalk] Dunno if I look tired or-or run down or-;;change64;high;reducing drug use;153;therapist;Alright.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;154;client;-or if I actually am tired or run down, I suppose. Again, this is things that I haven't really thought about-;;change64;high;reducing drug use;155;therapist;Alright.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;156;client;-but now I'm starting to think about.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;157;therapist;Right. And they got questions too-;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;158;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;159;therapist;-to ask are they—;other;64;high;reducing drug use;160;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;161;therapist;You're beginning to-to think about those things and-and-and what effect they may have on you.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;162;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;163;therapist;And the choices that you might have about it.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;164;client;Yeah. Hmm.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;165;therapist;What else? Are the-the-the-the problem of around the use of money, you know, the choices that you make around money, and the meth use has taken up quite a lot of the money-;question;64;high;reducing drug use;166;client;Yep.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;167;therapist;-over the last year and maybe also the effect on-on um, your job and being able-- maybe you're not auditioning as well as you might.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;168;client;Yep.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;169;therapist;And maybe the effects um, also on-on your physical appearance. An interesting question around the effect of meth use on physical appearance.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;170;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;171;therapist;Um, what-- are there any other problems? Any other things that-that are a bit of a downside to this?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;172;client;"Uh, I guess it's obviously having some sort of effect on my friends and my flatmates, 'cause, you know, they set me down and said, ""Look you gotta-";;change64;high;reducing drug use;173;therapist;Yeah.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;174;client;"-look into this or else we can't hang out anymore.""";;change64;high;reducing drug use;175;therapist;And that's a problem?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;176;client;That would be a problem, yeah.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;177;therapist;Why?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;178;client;If they didn't wanna hang out, well, then what have I got, I suppose?;;change64;high;reducing drug use;179;therapist;They're important.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;180;client;"Yeah. Yeah, and I mean part of it, yeah. Part of it I just wonder 'cause, you know, a lot of those friends that set me down are obviously the ones that are not part of that scene. I mean there were a couple there that-that are, but mostly they were the ones that sort of have always sorta been a bit judgy. You know, like when I first started all this stuff, you know. And clearly, there wasn't a problem like-- 'cause I used to be that guy as well you know, like, ""No never do that 'cause it's bad,"" and then you try it the first time and you go, ""Actually, it's not that bad."" It's not the end of the world if you're sensible with it, then it's not gonna be, you know.";;sustain64;high;reducing drug use;181;client;You have to take a stupid amount to do any kind of like, or, you know, to die or to end up in a hospital.;;sustain64;high;reducing drug use;182;therapist;YHmm.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;183;client;"So it's provided you don't-- you're not stupid with it. Then it's just a bit of fun but you can't really explain that to people who are-- have their walls up. So it's hard not to sit in this room full of people kind of going, ""Oh, you know, you really should stop the drugs, they're bad.""

But Ricky, let me just check, 'cause I may got this wrong, just check with you that um, there are some friends that you've got who do use who are still concerned about you.

It's not something I'm happy with.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;212;therapist;That creates problems?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;213;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;214;therapist;Yeah.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;215;client;Yeah, and I don't wanna be that person.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;216;therapist;Let's just come back to another thing, uh, that we were talking about a little bit earlier, and it's around your meth use as well and-and-and with your gay friends, with gay lifestyle. And-and that sounds like you're saying that-that-that when you party, when you go into the clubs, when you're being with friends that the meth use is always there?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;217;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;218;therapist;The-the availability of it is there.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;219;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;220;therapist;And everyone, most people are using.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;221;client;Yeah. Not-not necessarily P or whatever but yeah most people are doing something. Yeah. I suppose yeah it's kind of part of that scene that there's not a huge like, you know, you go to normal bars and most people are just drunk and wasted and like spewing everywhere and stuff and whereas that's a different scene. Like, people drink but they don't drink to that excess but they take other things and have a good time. And, yeah.;;sustain64;high;reducing drug use;222;therapist;And it might be hard to be part of that scene and not to be using drugs?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;223;client;Yeah. I mean there are people that do that. I suppose it-it would be hard. I-I haven't really thought about it, I suppose. That's all it is, all I've known that scene to be, you know, 'cause I'm quite new to it, you know-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;224;therapist;Right.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;225;client;so from the beginning it was always there.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;226;therapist;So there is a possibility that there are other parts of the scene that don't rely on drug use-;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;227;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;228;therapist;or particularly on-on meth use?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;229;client;Oh yeah, well, they must be. I can't imagine everyone is there, I guess just the ma-majority or at least p-- the majority of people that I know, yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;230;therapist;So that might be something that we can look at but later if you're interested in is maybe what are some of those other parts of the gay scene, whose still party and party medley, but when meth is not a- is not a dominant-;therapist_input;64;high;reducing drug use;231;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;232;therapist;-factor in that partying, and we- where-where there are, uh, uh, uh, gay groups that support people who-who are not wanting to be-- they have a lifestyle that is heavily weighted to drug use. So there are some options there to look at some other ideas if ;therapist_input;64;high;reducing drug use;233;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;234;therapist;-to consider, so it's not about giving up anything, it's not about huge major changes, it's about how can I improve the situation.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;235;client;Yep. Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;236;therapist;It's what I'm hearing you saying bring-- be a little bit more in control of what's-what's going on for me.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;237;client;Yep.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;238;therapist;So that I can pursue that plan.;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;239;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;240;therapist;What could be a- what could be a first step towards that?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;241;client;Well, [coughs] I must say I was a bit, um, you know, at the start when I was sort of saying I, you know, this is how often I do it and then I found myself talking about the kind of the weekday stuff I kinda took myself back a bit there. I suppose, you know, on a Wednesday by yourself like it doesn't sound that good.;;change64;high;reducing drug use;242;therapist;So that needs some thinking about, doesn't it?;question;64;high;reducing drug use;243;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;244;therapist;As to what-;question;64;high;reducing drug use;245;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;246;therapist;-what would work for you-;question;64;high;reducing drug use;247;client;Mm.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;248;therapist;as an alternative.;question;64;high;reducing drug use;249;client;Yeah. Yeah, but I think you're right about, just something to look forward to, because it's that midweek slump, you know. So far away till people will be in their place where they can-;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;250;therapist;Yeah.;other;64;high;reducing drug use;251;client;hang out and have a good time.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;252;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. And there are things that have gotta work for you, so that-;reflection;64;high;reducing drug use;253;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;254;therapist;-that's your ideas on there which are really important. But again there are some options, that if you wanted to look at, you know, just to at least be able to know what they are.;question;64;high;reducing drug use;255;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;256;therapist;Because there are clubs and there are groups and there are all kinds of things that meet through the week.;therapist_input;64;high;reducing drug use;257;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;258;therapist;And so, though they're not going to be necessarily like the party scene, they are other activities. Now I'm talking about gay groups and gay activities which are an option that-;therapist_input;64;high;reducing drug use;259;client;Yeah.;;neutral64;high;reducing drug use;260;therapist;"-you know, good to know about and-and-and maybe in-- within those options or something you might say, ""Oh yeah, I'd give that a go. Have a look.""";therapist_input;64;high;reducing drug use;261;client;Yeah. Yep.;;neutral65;high;smoking cessation;0;client;Many people have told me, um, if I quit smoking, I'm going to gain weight.;;neutral65;high;smoking cessation;1;therapist;Mm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;2;client;Well, food really doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better-;;neutral65;high;smoking cessation;3;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;4;client;if you quit smoking.;;neutral65;high;smoking cessation;5;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;6;client;Now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight.;;sustain65;high;smoking cessation;7;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;8;client;That means a new wardrobe, which I'd like to have, but I can't afford it.;;sustain65;high;smoking cessation;9;therapist;Okay. So right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years.;reflection;65;high;smoking cessation;10;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral65;high;smoking cessation;11;therapist;It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then.;reflection;65;high;smoking cessation;12;client;Right.;;neutral65;high;smoking cessation;13;therapist;Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping.;reflection;65;high;smoking cessation;14;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral65;high;smoking cessation;15;therapist;I'm wondering what else might be on that list.;question;65;high;smoking cessation;16;client;Um, withdrawal.;;sustain65;high;smoking cessation;17;therapist;Mm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;18;client;They say it's awful. Um, being cranky.;;sustain65;high;smoking cessation;19;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;20;client;And if I do go through this, I just hope my friends understand and will support me in what I'm trying to do.;;neutral65;high;smoking cessation;21;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal-;reflection;65;high;smoking cessation;22;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral65;high;smoking cessation;23;therapist;-the unpleasantness of that. Okay. What else might be on the, not so good side about smoking- about stopping?;question;65;high;smoking cessation;24;client;Um, I think everything's on the bad side about smoking, but, um, I've just smoked so long. I-I just can't imagine-;;sustain65;high;smoking cessation;25;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;26;client;not- going through life without smoking.;;sustain65;high;smoking cessation;27;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;28;client;I know I've got to stop. Uh, I'm having no health problems from cigarettes-;;change65;high;smoking cessation;29;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;30;client;-at present, but when the doctor told me this morning what could be waiting for me in the future-;;change65;high;smoking cessation;31;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;32;client;-that made me rethink-;;neutral65;high;smoking cessation;33;therapist;Mm.;other;65;high;smoking cessation;34;client;everything.;;neutral66;high;diabetes management;0;therapist;Hi, Mr. Stowe.;other;66;high;diabetes management;1;client;Hey.;;neutral66;high;diabetes management;2;therapist;How are you doing today? I'm Bruce Berger.;question;66;high;diabetes management;3;client;Pleasure to meet you.;;neutral66;high;diabetes management;4;therapist;I, uh, I'm a case manager with your health plan. I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes.;therapist_input;66;high;diabetes management;5;client;Yeah. I'm supposed to learn how to manage it. I just learned that I got diabetes and apparently, it's pretty bad 'cause, uh, she said my blood sugar was sky high, and then she laid all these huge consequences on things that can happen. That just sounds so disastrous and, uh, and then she told me I gotta do all this stuff. And man, I'm just sort of disappointed right now.;;sustain66;high;diabetes management;6;therapist;So you just- you just saw the doctor and, uh, you know, you sound like you just got blindsided, uh, with, uh, not only how, how frightening this seems that you have diabetes and that, uh, she-- you say she told you a whole lot of things that can happen with your eyes and circulation and all those kinds of things.;reflection;66;high;diabetes management;7;client;She mentioned my legs having troubles and-;;neutral66;high;diabetes management;8;therapist;And so you're really kind of reeling right now from, uh, all of that. And you sound a little bit pretty, pretty scared actually.;reflection;66;high;diabetes management;9;client;Well, that's, yeah. It's not just being scared, you know. I don't want that to happen to me, but then when I, when-when she reels off all these things I gotta do and I'm sort of going oh, oh, you know, I'm not certain I can even get it done. So it's sort of sitting-- well, you know, I'm sitting here thinking that, oh my God, this is- this is what's gonna happen to me.;;sustain66;high;diabetes management;10;therapist;So it sounds like-;other;66;high;diabetes management;11;client;And it is discouraging, just like discouraging.;;sustain66;high;diabetes management;12;therapist;So it sounds a lot like, uh, on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen, what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control. Can't imagine doing all those things, so you almost feel like all that bad stuff's gonna happen.;reflection;66;high;diabetes management;13;client;Yeah. It looks like a massive task that I'm may not be able to handle. And then, yeah, all this horrible stuff happens to me. I mean, it's- it's a bleak-looking situation and a lot worse.;;sustain66;high;diabetes management;14;therapist;Okay. And I-- And what I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some-some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down. I, you know, on the one hand, your doctor is right, you know. Your blood sugar is very high and we do wanna get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen. Uh, and-and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to-to get your blood sugar down. Um, you know, on the other hand, we can take this a step at a time, so it's not so overwhelming.;therapist_input;66;high;diabetes management;15;therapist;And I'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now. You know, for example, there- there's basically three things that need to be worked out with diabetes. Taking your medicine as prescribed. And honestly, if I was gonna work on one thing right away, given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that-that first, because that'll have the biggest impact. How-how does that sound so far?;therapist_input;66;high;diabetes management;16;client;Well, I don't think too much trouble in taking the medicines, especially since I understand my blood sugar is really high. and-;;change66;high;diabetes management;17;therapist;So that's easy to do.;reflection;66;high;diabetes management;18;client;Yeah, I'm pretty- I'm pretty good at taking drugs.;;change66;high;diabetes management;19;therapist;Yeah. 'Cause it looks like you need to just take your medicine, uh, uh, once a day from-from the prescription. So that sounds doable right now.;therapist_input;66;high;diabetes management;20;client;Yeah. I think I could probably do that.;;change66;high;diabetes management;21;therapist;Okay. The other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits, you know, to eat- eat healthier, uh, not necessarily less, but healthier. And the other thing would be getting, um, some more physical activity. And by the way, that doesn't mean going to a gym. That means things like more walking, maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or an escalator, stuff like that. Uh.;therapist_input;66;high;diabetes management;22;client;Well, she also mentioned monitoring my blood sugar and all this. And that just seemed like a lot of mumbo jambo to me.;;sustain66;high;diabetes management;23;therapist;Yeah. And that really is to give you feedback about how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task.;therapist_input;66;high;diabetes management;24;client;Oh, okay.;;neutral66;high;diabetes management;25;therapist;So it helps you know that when you're taking your medicine, when you're changing your eating habits, that it's really having an impact on your blood sugar 'cause getting your blood sugar down is going to keep you from having all of those other problems. How does all this-- where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling?;therapist_input;66;high;diabetes management;26;client;Well, I like it that I, you know, that-that we can do it at a step at a time. I mean, that's-- that relieves some pressure.;;change66;high;diabetes management;27;therapist;Okay.;other;66;high;diabetes management;28;client;And being able to talk with you and do this as we go along rather than-- I-I wasn't certain I could just, wham, put this huge program in[chuckles] into effect. Uh, but doing a step at a time and I, you know, that-- getting on the medicine, I don't think that's any big problem. That I can do I am pretty sure.;;change66;high;diabetes management;29;therapist;It sounds like you're very committed to that.;reflection;66;high;diabetes management;30;client;Yeah. I think I could do that. Uh, as long as there's no big-time side effects, but, uh-;;change67;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Is it okay if we go over the form you had filled out? We give this out to everybody who comes in.;question;67;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;All right. So here, it looks like you wrote that you drank alcohol on a few occasions in the last year, and you have used marijuana more often, 30 days in last year.;therapist_input;67;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Something like that.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay. When students and I talk about their substance use, the first thing I always say, I don't like to tell anyone what to do. That's not my job. Instead, I like to see if there's anything they would like to do, if anything, about their use. So what can you tell me about your marijuana use?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Uh, I vape. I have a pen, but I don't smoke it though.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Okay. How often?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Um, a few times a month.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Do you vape anything else besides marijuana?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;9;client;I did a peppermint oil once, someone shared it with me.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Okay. Is it okay if I share some information with you?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;We know marijuana has effects on the developing brain. For example, it can make it harder for you to concentrate, it can make it harder for you to remember things, and vaping can seriously hurt your lungs. About one in six people who begin using marijuana as a teenager, later on, become addicted. So what do you think about all this information that I've shared?;therapist_input;67;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, I don't think it's going to hurt me.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;How do you think it affects you?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Um, I don't know. It makes me relax, and it's fun to laugh with my friend.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Is there anything about marijuana that worries you, many things that you don't like?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Well, I don't want to get in trouble like at school.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;How could you get in trouble at school?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Well, I can get suspended and I would get kicked off the team, the basketball team.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;So staying in school and playing on the basketball team is important to you?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Right.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;So when you think about these things, are there any things you would like to change about your marijuana use?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;23;client;well, I was thinking to not use when basketball season start.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;What would be the benefits of that?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Well, I play better when I'm not high.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Marijuana affects how well you play. What would be the other benefits for you?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Well, I wouldn't get caught with using a pen, so I wouldn't get kicked off the basketball team.;;change67;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Okay. Well, it sounds like you have a goal of not using marijuana once basketball starts. How long do you think you could not use?;therapist_input;67;high;smoking cessation;29;client;For about a month.;;change67;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Okay. If I asked you to pick a number, 0 through 10, 0 meaning you're not very confident at all in meeting your goal, or 10 meaning you're very confident, what number would you pick?;therapist_input;67;high;smoking cessation;31;client;Um, seven.;;change67;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;A seven. Why do you think you picked that instead of a lower number like five?;therapist_input;67;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Well, I'm pretty sure, um, I can stop using for a month. I want to play well.;;change67;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;So, what steps could you take to help you stop using for a month?;therapist_input;67;high;smoking cessation;35;client;Uh, I don't know.;;neutral67;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;How about this question? What might happen within a month that might make you want to vape?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;37;client;Well, if I'm stressed or unhappy, that's when I usually wanna vape.;;change67;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;What else could you do instead of vaping when you feel that way?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Hmm, I like to play video games.;;change67;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Anything else?;question;67;high;smoking cessation;41;client;I can play basketball with my friend Sarah.;;change67;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Playing basketball and playing video games are a way to feel better.;reflection;67;high;smoking cessation;43;client;Yeah.;;change67;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Well, I'm glad to hear that you have a goal of quitting for a month and you are confident of reaching that goal. If you're willing to come back in a month or so, I would be curious to hear how your plan works out.;therapist_input;67;high;smoking cessation;45;client;Mm-hmm.;;change67;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Well, Good luck with basketball practice. If you want anything or need to talk about something before our next appointment, I'm here Monday through Thursday, and it's always good to see you.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, Andrea, thanks for coming in.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Hi. Thank you.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;So I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here. So I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Okay.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Basically, my job is to meet with all of the students. I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going, different behaviors that you might be engaging in, and thinking about any changes you might wanna make for your life if you decide that you do. It's not my job to change you. I couldn't even if I wanted to. That's not my role at all. It's really to help you think about, you know, how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward.;therapist_input;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Okay.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Does that sound okay?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;All right. So why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Sure. Um, as you know, I'm Andrea, I, uh, I'm a junior I'm in the marching band. I play the tenor sax.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Oh, neat.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Yeah, I'm also in the-- I'm a bit of a band geek. [laughter] I play, you know, in the wind ensemble and the jazz band, things like that.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Wow. You really are involved in music.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah, [crosstalk].;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;When did you start?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Oh, I started playing about 10 years ago, actually.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Wow.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah, I started on the violin first, and then I went on, explored a little with the piano, clarinet, finally found the tenor sax, and yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Very cool. I've always wanted to be good at music. [laughter] All right. So it sounds like you're in band and a-a few other musical ensembles, any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Um, you know, just hanging out with my friends or go to the beach, things like that.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Just kind of everyday sort of stuff?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah [laughs].;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay. Tell me a little bit about your family.;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Uh, well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old- years older than me. My parents, and I have a dog [laughs].;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Cute.

Okay.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;My big boy.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;[laughs] Very fun. All right. And how are things going in school for you?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;They're pretty good. Grades have been pretty all right. Still like 3.7 ish.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Okay, great, so you're doing well. What sorts of goals do you have for after college- oh, after high school?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Uh, I'd like to, you know, I'd like to, of course, graduate high school, hopefully, go to a nice Ivy League school.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Oh, all right.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;But I mean, that might not happen. And then I'd like to go on and become a doctor. Study psychology and then become a psychiatrist or something.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay, you have some pretty big dreams.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;That's great. That's really exciting to think about that-;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;-and sort of be looking forward to the future and those things. All right. Well, one thing I'm going to ask you about is, um, you know, different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life. Whether it's, you know, their cult;therapist_input;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Like belonging or sense of community. Again, cultural identity or family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. So, when you think about yourself, which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life?;therapist_input;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, I think a sense of community and belonging.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Okay.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;I think those two and, um, respect.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Respect, okay. Can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Yeah. Well, I think community and belonging, I kind of related them. Um, you know how I said I was in the marching band?;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;I really, you know, I really enjoy being in that team setting of, you know, being with other people and all working toward- together towards that one goal.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;And then in terms of respect, I-I kind of view that as one of like my major like rules. Like, I-I really do think respect is important, to respect myself and respect those around me, so.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Okay.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;I place great importance in that.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Okay, great. So sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of, um, uh, belonging, like you said.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;And sort of a-a sense of purpose in a way.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yes, purpose.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;And then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Yes.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;Not just authority, but respecting yourself, respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you. Okay, that's great.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Definitely, that's right.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;All right. Well, um, one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends. So what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Um, sometimes we just, you know, go to the movies, go to the beach, like I had said, or sometimes we just get together at someone's house, play some good board games and hang out.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Mm-hmm, and when you're hanging out with friends, is there ever alcohol involved?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Yeah, sometimes.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Uh, well it's mostly just for, for parties or party settings is kind of to get things going and get everything loosened up as they say.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And so when you go to parties, most of the time there's alcohol there?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;Okay. And how often do you think you would say you're drinking?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;I'd say, um, on a not busy month, for instance, I'd say about like two weekends out of the month. Two or three.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;Mm-hmm. So about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not. Can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;The days that we drink are mostly, like I said, they're parties, so it's more of that whole partying and dancing and, you know, having everyone have fun. And then when we don't, it's a lot more relaxed. It's a lot more hanging out, playing board games, watching a movie it's not yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;So it really depends on what the activity is, whether or not alcohol is gonna be there?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;Definitely.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;Okay. And do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus a night you're playing board games?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Um, I think of them as-as different, I think, you know, like in playing board games and things, it's meant to be relaxing.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;So it's nice to have like that kind of breather-;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;-versus with a party it's a lot more energetic it's, uh, after it all, it's very draining.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;But in the moment it's quite fun to dance and have fun.;;sustain68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;Okay. So there's sort of pros and cons on both sides?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Okay. What are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Um, it's, you know, when we drink, we-we tend to have more fun because I guess we're not, you know, everyone's drinking together. We're a lot more loosened up and relaxed-;;sustain68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;-and not really thinking about stresses or things like that, but it can be--When it's too much drinking, it can be- can be obviously bad.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;Okay. So sort of in the-the too much drinking or-or at times, can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;91;client;Um, a lot of times, it'll make- it'll make people stupid. [laughs] Yeah, you know, people make dumb decisions and things like that. We-we usually try to be as safe about it;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;92;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;93;client;-as possible. So we'll like sleep over at a friend's house. And so that, you know, we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group. So we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;94;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;95;client;But, um, definitely some of the ideas people can have when they're stup- when they're drunk and can be really stupid.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;96;therapist;Mm-hmm. So you're trying to, like you said, not engage in really dangerous activities?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;97;client;Yeah;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;98;therapist;You're trying to stay put, you're not driving. You're trying to stay with people that you trust. Um, but yet it sounds like there's still some-some things happening from time to time.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;99;client;Sometimes. Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;100;therapist;Can you tell me a little bit about that?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;101;client;Well, I, especially don't like it whenever me or one of my friends, like we drink too much and we end up like throwing up or things like that, that I don't- that's not fun.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;102;therapist;Yeah. Throwing up is never fun.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;103;client;It's not.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;104;therapist;And how often do you think that happens?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;105;client;For me, that's happened to me once. It was the first time I ever drunk and it was- it was a lot, I didn't know what I was doing. I was mixing all kinds of weird things and just kind of taking anything everyone- anyone gave me;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;106;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;107;client;-and that didn't end well.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;108;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;109;client;But after that, I haven't- but I do have friends that still do sometimes, so I'll end up like having to take care of them or something and-;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;110;therapist;Okay.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;111;client;It kind of puts a downer on my- on my fun.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;112;therapist;Uh-huh. Okay. So, on the one side, some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed, sorta, um, carefree can kind of let loose a little bit more, on-on the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess, planning involved-;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;113;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;114;therapist;-because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then, um, there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you, that sometimes you're stuck your-your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck de;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;115;client;Yeah. People can get a little like sloppy, I guess. Like they're all loose, like with people in corners doing things that should be done in private-;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;116;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;117;client;and that kind of stuff.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;118;therapist;So you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't need to see.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;119;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;120;therapist;Got it. Okay. Um, all right. Well, you mentioned a couple of times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the dangerous aspect of the drinking. Why did you make those decisions?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;121;client;I just- I've, you know, I have an aunt who is an alcoholic. So I-I see like the issues that are involved and I've seen movies and things I know that drunk driving is an issue-;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;122;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;123;client;So, I, you know, I wanna be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like we can let loose but still be safe like in someone's house or sort of my parents will tell me something. But-- So, I- like I know that there are dangers involved and I guess I wanna limit that.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;124;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;125;client;And so be where I have fun.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;126;therapist;Okay. Yeah, it sounds kinda similar to your, um, your value of respect to yourself.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;127;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;128;therapist;On the one hand, you- the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;129;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;130;therapist;If there's too much, then it sort of—;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;131;client;Then it kind of defeats the purpose? [laughs];;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;132;therapist;Right. And then with the respect, one of the things you mentioned, is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries, not sort of cross lines.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;133;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;134;therapist;Um, how do you think that the drinking fits in with that?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;135;client;In terms of what? In terms of respect?;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;136;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;137;client;I think, well in a way, I do think that drinking is probably a form of disrespect to my own body because I'm not putting things- I'm putting things in it that shouldn't be there.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;138;therapist;Okay.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;139;client;And then-- But in terms of at- how it is I am respecting myself, I am- I'm respecting myself by like trying to stay in someone's house and like trying to limit my drinking so I don't get to that blackout like throwing up and everything.;;sustain68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;140;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;141;client;And try to, you know, let loose but still be in control of my behavior so I'm not gonna go somewhere with a person I met-;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;142;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;143;client;-into I don't know where to, I don't know what, and-;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;144;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;145;client;things like that.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;146;therapist;Okay. So you're sort of looking for that balance-;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;147;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;148;therapist;of how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefits but not cross over.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;149;therapist;Okay. And what have you come up with at this point? Do you have sort of a-a limit that you stick to or are you--?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;150;client;"I usually-- Well, I start off like I make sure that I make my own drink so I know what's in it and how much is in it. So in that way I control how much I drink. So, I usually just, you know, get one of those cups and then make one drink. And then I'll try to make it last as long as possible. And I'll be like, ""All right, this is my one drink"" and I'm good in that way. I still have something in my cup so people aren't gonna be like, ""Oh, here. Have some more."" I'd be like, ""No, I'm good. I have mine,"" and I'll still be, you know, having some to like let loose a little.";;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;151;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you feel that that's working pretty well for you or do you sometimes exceed that limit or-or what do you think?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;152;client;"For the most part, it works pretty well because, like I said, people, you know, people come asking me, trying to pressure me, I'll be like, ""No, I'm good. I have- You know, I still have something. I'll get some later."" And I never end up getting anything. Oh, but sometimes they'll be like, ""Hey, let's take a shot,"" and everyone's gathered around like the kitchen or something ready to take a shot. And then at that point, I'll be like, ""Oh, well, maybe I can take one more."" And that's when I start, you know, falling into-";;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;153;therapist;Okay.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;154;client;way too much.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;155;therapist;So, uh, uh, a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you would like-;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;156;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;157;therapist;-would like to make some adjustments-;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;158;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;159;therapist;-to-to make it a little smoother. Okay. So, kind of thinking along those lines, how important is it to you make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;160;client;Um, I'd like to make sure that I'd, you know, in terms of respecting myself and my body, I'd like to, you know, try to drink less.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;161;therapist;Okay.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;162;client;Like I-I-- You know, it is nice to let loose and have fun, but I'd also like it to be so, you know, I'm not damaging my body, you know.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;163;therapist;Right.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;164;client;Like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;165;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;166;client;And, um, you know, have my friends on board with a similar mentality so we can kind of work at it together as a group, as a- as a community.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;167;therapist;Uh-huh. So kind of combining you alls-;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;168;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;169;therapist;-goals. Okay. So, you-you have a goal it sounds like, of actually cutting back on your drinking. How important is it to you to work on that goal and on a scale of one to ten, where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing right;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;170;client;I'd say about like-like a six or a seven.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;171;therapist;Oh, okay.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;172;client;I'd like to work on it but, you know, if I get around to it, I get around to it. If I don't, I don't.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;173;therapist;Uh-huh. Why do you say six or seven rather than like a four?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;174;client;Um, because I still think it's-it's important.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;175;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;176;client;I still, you know. Like I said, I don't want to hurt my body. Especially going to med school like I know how things affect your body and also affect your-your social and your school work and things like. I know that once I get to college, it's not- it's not gonna-gonna work out being, you know, drinking every weekend and then like trying to wake up early and go to school, take an exam. Like I know that's not- that's not feasible. It's not a good idea.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;177;therapist;Yeah, looking ahead, you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;178;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;179;therapist;Okay. Well, how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to-;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;180;client;I think I-;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;181;therapist;on that same scale from one to ten?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;182;client;I think if I made the decision that I was going to, for sure, then I think definitely like a 10 I know it'd be going through.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;183;therapist;Oh, wow. Okay. Why do you say 10?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;184;client;It's just because I know that once I make the decision, I know I can do it. It's making the decision in the first place.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;185;therapist;Okay. And so you mentioned the- you know, quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down. Um, have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;186;client;Um, I'm thinking of maybe like trying to convince my friends without sounding, you know, dorky or something and be like, hey, you know, let's just stay in today. Like, let's not go out or something. Or just be like, hey, I'm not like-- I'm not going to drink today. And then even if my friends do, like being okay with them, drinking around me and not doing it, and then them being okay with me drinking-- Me not drinking and them doing whatever they want.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;187;therapist;So sort of, um, trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol-;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;188;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;189;therapist;-and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;190;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;191;therapist;Okay. Does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;192;client;I think so. I think it's-it's very feasible. I think it's possible.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;193;therapist;Okay. Um, so I guess we'll talk about, um, less alcohol activities. I'm just making some notes to myself and then maybe, um, reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved. Okay. Um, so that-that goal sounds feasible, you said? Would it be okay if we met in a couple of weeks to sort of see how it's going?;therapist_input;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;194;client;I think so. I think that's good.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;195;therapist;Does that sound like something you'd like to do?;question;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;196;client;Yeah.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;197;therapist;Okay. Well, I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me, you know, it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself, really ambitious goals of going to medical school and, you know, becoming a psychiatrist or, um, some-some other form of physician. Um, you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;198;therapist;And it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a-a lot of friends who you feel probably would be, uh, supportive, even if you cut down on alcohol and that, you know, there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health, um, your school performance, and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of-of, um, drinking too much.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;199;therapist;Um, so yeah, you know, it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and-and interested in meeting again, I'd be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going.;reflection;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;200;client;Yeah, I'd like to.;;change68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;201;therapist;All right. Great. So I'll-I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks.;other;68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;202;client;Perfect. Nice.;;neutral68;high;reducing alcohol consumption;203;therapist;Great.;other;69;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hi, Dr. Martin. I heard you had a question for me. What did you want to talk about?;question;69;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;I'm sorry, but are you the pharmacist? I just had a question about citalopram.;;neutral69;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Yeah, I'm the pharmacist on duty. Citalopram, okay. It's an antidepressant and it comes in 10, 20, and 40-milligram strengths. It's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about 35 hours. For side effects, there are sexual side effects, heart side effects, and stomach side effects.;therapist_input;69;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Okay, but I just wanted to know if it interacts with phenelzine?;;neutral69;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Oh, um, yeah, I think that should be fine.;therapist_input;69;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Okay, thanks for that. I have an appointment to run to.;;neutral69;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;All right, thanks. Call me anytime.;other;70;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hi, Dr. Martin. I'm Lori. I'm the pharmacist on duty here today. I understand that you have some questions about the medication citalopram. Do you have a minute to talk about that?;question;70;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Yeah, I do, just a couple of minutes though.;;neutral70;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;All right. Well, do you have any specific questions?;question;70;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Um, nothing specific. I just am unfamiliar with the medication.;;neutral70;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Okay. Well, citalopram is an SSRI medication. Its indication is for depression and it's typically dosed as a 20-milligram tablet but it is available as 10, 20, and 40 milligrams. Any patients started on this medication should be monitored for improvement in symptoms in four to eight weeks.;therapist_input;70;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Okay. Uh, what about side effects?;;neutral70;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;If there are some side effects to this, it can include GI effects, sedation, or sexual dysfunction. But if you have a patient that suffers from any of those things, you can try either decreasing the dose or changing them to a different agent. Do you have any other questions?;therapist_input;70;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Um, what about does it interact with phenelzine?;;neutral70;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;Oh, that I'm not sure of. Um, can I get back to you later on this afternoon with that answer?;question;70;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Oh, sure.;;neutral70;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Fantastic. Thank you.;other;70;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;Thank you.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;So, you've got this dream by the sounds of it, which is, you know, to have a partner, and a house, and a nice car-;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;-so don't forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a- be a good dad-;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;-to your kids. So, is this dream starting to-- I am getting a picture of?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;Yeah, it'd be good.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;I guess it doesn't.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;Uh, I guess I have to keep coming-coming back here and go into court and stuff.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;Yeah?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;Yeah. It kinda messes things up.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;Yeah. It kinda messes up that dream, that picture?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;Yeah. It makes it harder.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;Mm. Makes it harder? Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;Mm.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;And harder to—;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;Like it's hard to get a job 'cause you have to say that you've done prison time and stuff, so it's pretty hard.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;Yeah.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;And we've talked about that idea of you getting a job and something to do with cars 'cause that's where your passion is.;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;Mm.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;Yeah? So, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;Uh, I don't know if-if I would go into polytech, done courses there or something.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;25;client;Yeah. Like, if they've got jobs now.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;26;therapist;Okay, so you know some people?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;28;therapist;You've gone down that road of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;29;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;30;therapist;getting a qualification?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;31;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;32;therapist;Yeah? So, what-what would interest you about going down that same, sort of, path?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;33;client;Just learn more about cars and just, kind of, hands-on job.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;34;therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;35;client;[sighs] Mechanic, or panel [unintelligible 00:18:02], or just-- I wouldn't care, I just-- as long as it's cars.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;36;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;37;client;Yes, pretty much.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;38;therapist;Yeah?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;40;therapist;Okay. So-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;41;client;Just I have to get that training, I guess, and then probably get a job.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;42;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;43;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;44;therapist;Okay. So, what sort of training did you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;45;client;Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. I don't know what exactly it was, but—;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;46;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;47;client;It took them like-- And, it took them like a year or something, and then they went into apprenticeship.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;50;therapist;Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these friends that you've got?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;51;client;Yeah. I could do it pretty easy. It's just, like, I probably know all this stuff already.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;52;therapist;Okay. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, Billy?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;53;client;Like, well, I went out and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, like, having to apply, so I-I just couldn't-- I don't know. I couldn't do it.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;54;therapist;Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech—;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;55;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;56;therapist;and picked up some forms?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;57;client;Yeah, yeah. Passed around and everything.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;58;therapist;Wow.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;59;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;60;therapist;That's fantastic, Billy.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;61;client;Yeah, but I just-- Like, they wouldn't help me out, so-;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;62;therapist;Okay.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;63;client;-I got some forms and-;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;64;therapist;Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they-- like it didn't help you? What-what-what happened?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;65;client;I asked- I asked them what I had to do, and they said I had to fill out some forms, but-;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;66;therapist;Yeah.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;67;client;-well, the forms, it's too confusing.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;68;therapist;Okay. So, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;69;client;Yeah, yeah. Well, I got one- I got one for panel [unintelligible 00:19:33], and one for, uh, uh, like, panel and paint-;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;70;therapist;Mm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;71;client;-so, learning how to paint cars and stuff.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;72;therapist;Yeah.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;73;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;74;therapist;Okay. So, you got the forms, took them- took them home?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;75;client;Yeah. I was gonna fill them out there, but then I didn't get them, so I took them home, but I was gonna get Donna to help me, but I just didn't get around to it.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;76;therapist;Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;77;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;78;therapist;Yeah? What-what's the confusing bit?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;79;client;I didn't understand, like, what you're supposed to write down. Like, yeah. I'm not good at this, maybe too confusing.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;80;therapist;Yeah. So, when you've had to write things or fill out forms before, how-how's that been for you?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;81;client;I don't really deal with it. I s-- I don't really like writing.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;82;therapist;You don't like writing?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;83;client;No.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;84;therapist;Yeah. So, wondering what that's about, about not actually liking writing.;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;85;client;No, I'm just real messy, so people can't read it.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;86;therapist;People can't read-- People can't read your handwriting?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;87;client;[chuckles] Yeah, no. It's what they say, yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;88;therapist;Oh, you must be a doctor.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;89;client;Yeah, I am. [chuckles];;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;90;therapist;Yeah? [chuckles] Yeah?;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;91;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;92;therapist;Okay. So, you need some help to fill out the forms?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;93;client;Yeah. Like, a computer or something. If you could write on a computer, I could do that.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;94;therapist;Mm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;95;client;But, we don't have a computer.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;96;therapist;Okay. All right, so what-what do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it off?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;97;client;Just ask to get someone else to do it I guess. I guess I could ask Donna, but it's been embarrassing.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;98;therapist;Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask Donna to give you some help-;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;99;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;100;therapist;-because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;101;client;Well, I don't know if it's that serious, it's just-;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;102;therapist;Okay.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;103;client;-I'm sure most people can fill them out. I don't know, I just don't get it.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;104;therapist;Hmm. So, who else could you ask to help you?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;105;client;No one. I guess you. You could do it. Would you do it?;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;106;therapist;Well, have you got the forms with you?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;107;client;No.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;108;therapist;Okay. I'm wondering about-- because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars-;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;109;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;110;therapist;-and getting on this road where you're staying out of trouble because you've got this, um, interest-;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;111;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;112;therapist;-which you can do. So, it seems a real shame that the forms are gonna get in the way, so we need to find a way around the forms.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;113;client;Mm.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;114;therapist;Yeah? So, what do you think, between now and next week, you can do around the forms?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;115;client;I guess, I'd go pick them up and I don't know, I guess I could ask Donna, but she'd probably help me, I don't really want to.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;116;therapist;She'd probably help you, but you don't really want to. It sounds like you're a bit embarrassed.;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;117;client;Well, I don't know. Plus, well, I don't know if I could bother getting up at nine o'clock every morning and having to go to Polytec. I've got used to sleeping in.;;sustain71;high;reducing recidivism;118;therapist;Mm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;119;client;At night.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;120;therapist;So, the whole thing about going back to poly-- going back to school-;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;121;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;122;therapist;-going back to polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently living, and you're not quite sure if you can do that.;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;123;client;Yeah. Uh, it would be cool if it's anything like school. Like, I didn't really enjoy school. [unintelligible 00:22:56] so writing and stuff, and I wouldn't wanna do that. If it's all hands-on though, it would be all good.;;sustain71;high;reducing recidivism;124;therapist;Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way.;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;125;client;Yeah. No, it does get in the way. I just don't wanna do it.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;126;therapist;Mm. Okay.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;127;client;It's a waste of time.;;sustain71;high;reducing recidivism;128;therapist;All right. So, it sounds like we might need to have some more conversation around that.;therapist_input;71;high;reducing recidivism;129;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;130;therapist;So, what's really getting in the way?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;131;client;For what?;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;132;therapist;Well, this writing business. What's really getting in the way?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;133;client;Of what? Well, I don't get it.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;134;therapist;Well, I'm wondering, like-- it sounds like it's a thing that you're putting up as saying you can't do-;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;135;client;Yeah. I can't.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;136;therapist;-so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;137;client;Oh, it's pretty [unintelligible 00:23:47], but, like, still-- I don't know, I'm not retarded, or anything. I can write and read.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;138;therapist;Mm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;139;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;140;therapist;Yeah. Well, I have to say, I think it's really obvious that you're not retarded.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;141;client;Like--;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;142;therapist;[chuckles];other;71;high;reducing recidivism;143;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;144;therapist;Yeah, we are having a really good conversation here.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;145;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;146;therapist;So, reading and writing is not a strong point for you.;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;147;client;No, not really. Yeah, I don't really enjoy it.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;148;therapist;Mm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;149;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;150;therapist;So, how much reading and writing is involved in the course that you're gonna go on?;question;71;high;reducing recidivism;151;client;I don't know. Hopefully, not many-- not much, but that's what I wanna find out, I guess.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;152;therapist;So, what'd it be like if you were more confident in your reading and writing? What'd that be like?;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;153;client;It'd make everything easier.;;change71;high;reducing recidivism;154;therapist;Mm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;155;client;Like-- I don't really like reading books or anything, so I don't really care about that but just, say, real-life stuff like going to the bank, and stuff like that-;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;156;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;157;client;-yeah, that have filling out forms.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;158;therapist;Yeah.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;159;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;160;therapist;And, I guess that there will be manuals and stuff like that on-;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;161;client;Yeah.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;162;therapist;-your course that, you know, to-- the hands-on stuff, it sounds like you're really confident around doing, but it's the more reading, writing, book, kind of, stuff that you are not so--;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;163;client;Yeah, I didn't think about that.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;164;therapist;Mm.;other;71;high;reducing recidivism;165;client;Yeah, that'd suck if you had to read, like, a big manual or something. Hmm.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;166;therapist;Mm. Okay. So- so like before you get to here where you got this dream and there's some things that need to happen before that.;reflection;71;high;reducing recidivism;167;client;Mm.;;neutral71;high;reducing recidivism;168;therapist;Yeah. So, mm, we need to think about what's the very first step.;therapist_input;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school. And as-as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student-athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule. And I've been hearing some chatter from some of the other kids about a party this weekend, and from what I hear, where you were there and, you know, I can't confirm or deny anything. So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences, but I did want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.;therapist_input;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Right. Actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as, you know, I'm, um, I'm an honor student. I-I usually I'm studying over the weekend and my parents don't let me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage, to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I- when I got there, like I'm not used to this like party environment where everything you see in the movies is kind of what happens, where you have people just drinking out of the bottle-;;neutral72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;-or playing random games with alcohol, just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and like conform to what everyone else was doing. So I wouldn't be- I wouldn't be ostracized.;;sustain72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Yeah, you know, I get it. Like, we've all been there. Okay. You know, I was in high school ones too, you know, I drank too. I get it. There's not a ton to do in this town a-and kids drink, but, you know, promise we have these rules-;therapist_input;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;I understand.;;neutral72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;-and you're on a team, you have to stick by the rules.;therapist_input;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Okay. Um, I know that it's bad for me. It's-it's bad for my body. It's bad for-for-for-for being on the team, for being an athlete. It hinders my performance. Just, I don't know. I-I feel that my-my friends pressure me. I don't know. I feel I should like go with different friend groups. Maybe. I don't know.;;change72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Yeah. Chris, come on. You're getting peer pressure?;therapist_input;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;I don't know, like being in a sports team, y-you feel very, you have to like be unified with the group.;;neutral72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Yeah, but you're one of the leaders.;therapist_input;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Right. And as being one of the leaders, my fellow teammates expect me to be-- I expect them to lead not only in the sports but also in social environments. And if that's a social- that's a social custom in our society. So it's like—;;sustain72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Yeah. Well, maybe you can start leading as a non-drinker then.;therapist_input;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;I could, but that could also backfire on me. I feel that I could be ridiculed for being, having a stick up my butt, you know.;;sustain72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;You're a star player, who's going to pick on you?;question;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;I mean, it's just one-- I'm just one person against the voice of the mob.;;sustain72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;All right. Well, yeah. So the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking. I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook. You know, there-there are rules at this school and in my job, I have to enforce them. So, you know, like I said, I get it, you know-;therapist_input;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I understand.;;neutral72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;-I'm not saying I know what it's like. I-I get that you want to have fun in your teenage years. I get that. But, you know, you are a star player, we want to keep you on the team. You know, we got to figure out a way to get through this.;therapist_input;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Well, I'll dedicate the time, not to party and night. Well, not-not-not party, but, you know, get involved with alcohol to that extent. And like, have it publicized on the internet.;;change72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;What do you mean?;question;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Like on Facebook, all the pictures that you saw on the internet. Like I w- I will avoid those situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time to put on the internet so others can see, even though.;;change72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;All right. Yeah. I mean, we got to have a deal here if you're going to be on the team. Okay?;therapist_input;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Right. I'll stop.;;change72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;All right. You promise?;other;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;I promise.;;change72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;All right. Shake.;question;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Shake.;;change72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;All right. I'll see you later.;other;72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;See you later.;;neutral72;low;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;All right.;other;73;high;reducing drug use;0;client;He, um, introduced me to it too, so I've tried it.;;neutral73;high;reducing drug use;1;therapist;So with his encouragement, you-you tried some drugs.;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;2;client;Oxy.;;neutral73;high;reducing drug use;3;therapist;You tried oxy? Okay.;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;4;client;Yeah.;;neutral73;high;reducing drug use;5;therapist;Okay. And he encouraged you to do that.;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;6;client;Well, yeah he said it was a pain- a pain medicine.;;neutral73;high;reducing drug use;7;therapist;He said that it would help you with some of the pain that you've been having.;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;8;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral73;high;reducing drug use;9;therapist;Yeah.;other;73;high;reducing drug use;10;client;And it has, but I don't do it as often, it's just sometimes.;;neutral73;high;reducing drug use;11;therapist;Okay. So you trusted him on that, and you tried it out and you found that it helped you in certain ways. What are some of the things that you said it's-- takes some of the pain away, it's not just-- you know.;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;12;client;Dealing with my grandma's loss.;;sustain73;high;reducing drug use;13;therapist;Okay, so that's helped you.;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;14;client;Yeah. I feel alone, and I just, I miss her and, it does- it does help but,-;;sustain73;high;reducing drug use;15;therapist;Mm-hmm. So it help—;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;16;client;-I don't wanna have to rely on having to take that.;;change73;high;reducing drug use;17;therapist;Okay. So it's not something you wanna rely on, you don't see yourself continuing to use this. It's something that you've found at least for the moment very helpful?;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;18;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, and—;;neutral73;high;reducing drug use;19;therapist;But it's not something that you wanna make a habit of becoming reliant on, or dependent?;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;20;client;Right.;;change73;high;reducing drug use;21;therapist;Yeah, okay. Um, and-and so that's a lot going on right now for you? Yeah.;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;22;client;Yeah, it is.;;neutral73;high;reducing drug use;23;therapist;You've been managing in the best way you can. You also have some doubts about it too, it sounds like?;reflection;73;high;reducing drug use;24;client;Yeah, well, I don't really know too much about it, other than it makes me feel good.;;sustain73;high;reducing drug use;25;therapist;Okay, so for now you know that it makes you feel good.;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;0;client;Hi.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;1;therapist;Hi, Deborah. How are you doing today?;question;76;high;unidentifiable;2;client;Good, I'm doing really good.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;3;therapist;Yes, um, so you did do your Values Clarification Sheet. Is there anything that you'd like to talk about that you discovered?;question;76;high;unidentifiable;4;client;Yeah, I really like doing this, and, um, I-I rated health as my first-;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;5;therapist;Oh, so it's your first?;question;76;high;unidentifiable;6;client;-uh, value. Yeah, because I really value physical and mental health, um, spiritual, emotional. Everything as a whole package, I guess, health. Um, and I'm working on, um, a certification to become a fitness trainer. Cal State [inaudible 00:00:40] there's ;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;7;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;8;client;Um, but it's kind of exciting, a different career path in my life. Being an office worker for so long is getting boring too-- physical activity, health, in that respect.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;9;therapist;So, health being your number one, um, which is kind of pushing you into this new direction, as far as you being a prior officer worker? You're doing something that you're actually living to do.;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;10;client;Yeah, I like being active. You know, if I could, um, be more adept to tennis, and I would love to do something like that coaching people how to play tennis, but I don't. I know enough about the game and play it, but I-I don't think my skill level would be high enough to actually coach other people but—;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;11;therapist;Now, have you done this sheet more than once?;question;76;high;unidentifiable;12;client;Yes, I have.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;13;therapist;And then, has health always been number one for you?;question;76;high;unidentifiable;14;client;It's been in the top. It's been up there, yeah. I don't remember if it's always been number one. It's probably definitely been in the top three. Uh, yeah, because I've had problems, um, with inner harmony, I guess in different stages in my life, so I don't get that. This time I put it at number two.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;15;therapist;Inner harmony is number two?;question;76;high;unidentifiable;16;client;Yeah, it's just funny how it came out that it wasn't in the top 12. But then when I look at it again it had something to do with, um, peace, uh, inner peace or something or something in there.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;17;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;18;client;And, um, I put that as a higher priority, or top of my value list.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;19;therapist;So, would you like to express more on the inner harmony part of how that affects your life?;question;76;high;unidentifiable;20;client;Yeah. Um, since I've been practicing yoga, and since I learned how to teach yoga, that's been something that I've been, um, coming to terms with more, that I feel like I have a lot more inner harmony. I'm more at peace with myself, and in-in the quiet times, and if I'm meditating.;;change76;high;unidentifiable;21;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;22;client;Um, I really feel like-- yeah, I feel like really good about myself.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;23;therapist;So, yoga, is that based on the number two, like inner harmony? That's where that comes from?;question;76;high;unidentifiable;24;client;"Yeah, that's part of it. Yeah, and then just feeling like, um, I don't have to please other people either. It's not a selfish thing to put myself first. And, uh, that's something I've always tried to do, make other people happy, please other people, and-and also put myself second, third, fourth, or whatever it is. And I always thought, ""Well, that's the way a good person should be.They should always put other people first, you know. And then there's times for that, you know. There's something going on, and you wanna go out of your way to help people, and you say, ""Well, my needs aren't so important right now."" I think that is okay to do once in a while. As long as you know- you know that you're not really, um, doing anything detrimental to yourself while you're doing it. And you realize, ""Well, I'm just-- I'm really helping this other person a lot, and it gives me satisfaction.""";;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;25;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;26;client;"Not out of a sense of, uh, you know, ""I'm obligated to this person.""";;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;27;therapist;Yes, yes, yes. So, basically, reflecting on how you felt before about you were coming second, third, and fourth. Um, it was- it was really a problem, you know, like, how could you be so, you know, selfish, and think about yourself when-;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;28;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;29;therapist;-the reality is inner peace and inner harmony is based around, you know, self-self worth, and you know, self-- and-and dealing with-;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;30;client;Self love.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;31;therapist;self love.;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;32;client;Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah. [crosstalk] And that it's not selfish.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;33;therapist;Yeah that's not selfish. And so you feel as though you can help, you can be of help to others, um, just as long as it's not detrimental to yourself. It's true.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;34;client;Yes. Yeah. Um, then, and but also service, that's third because I really do enjoy helping other people. Being there for other people, you know, and-and if it puts myself out. Like I have my brother, his-his daughter, and his granddaughter they come over and, uh, I slept on-on the air mattress and, uh, me with my mother and my dad and my sis-- my-- his daughter in the other spare room that I have.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;35;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;36;client;And I do that, but I think, well, it's one night or it's two nights that I have a guest. I could sleep in my bed all the other days. [unintelligible 00:05:54];;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;37;client;So, you know, even if it's a little inconvenient for me, or my house gets messy, or my kitchen is a mess, or whatever they don't pick up after themselves it's okay. You know, I'll live. You know, it's okay, it's not a big deal. Yeah. Before it was wisdom, because I really, that's, um-- it is high on my list and it might be higher if these other things weren't here.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;38;client;But I like I enjoy learning and experiencing different cultures going, um, to different places in the world and then just also being around people that live in the community that are from other cultures. And I think that brings a lot of wisdom. And just also being open to, uh, differences. And then like today, Election Day realizing that something might happen, uh, in the Congress or the Senate, that's gonna be sort of against my values but if it happens, it happens, and I have to deal with it and-and be at peace with myself with about whatever anybody else is doing I still have to have that inner peace within myself.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;39;therapist;And in the sense of you saying in your words, you'll live.;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;40;client;Right. Mm-hmm.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;41;therapist;So, live, um, having that as a priority, um, do you feel as though, like you said before you'll live, but you know that you're able to look at, okay, these are my values, you know, and you're able to acknowledge [unintelligible 00:07:30] values.;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;42;client;Yeah.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;43;therapist;And learning the differences of the different cultures that brings you wisdom.;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;44;client;Yes. And school learning in the classroom and outside of the classroom. Where I've been in different Native American communities, reservations, place I spent two months in the summertime really, uh, learning about the cultures is a beautiful place to be, there's a lot of wisdom. And, uh, fun, pleasure, fun, satisfaction-;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;45;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;46;client;-enjoyment. I think it's intertwined in a lot of things. It's fun to learn about pe-- other people, other cultures. it's fun to have the inner harmony. I think that- I think that was an all-encompassing thing about life. The part of it is to experience pl;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;47;therapist;So pleasure being your number five.;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;48;client;Yeah.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;49;therapist;Okay.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;50;client;And when I think of the flip side of that, uh, um, I-I know there's gonna be pain, disappointment, upset in my life, um, too that I accept that and that's part of joy.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;51;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;52;client;True joy comes from knowing it's not always gonna be happy. I'm gonna- I'm gonna be bummed out sometimes.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;53;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;54;client;I'm gonna be disappointed, I'm gonna be injured or whatever.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;55;therapist;So you've taken that into account that-;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;56;client;Absolutely.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;57;therapist;things may happen in life.;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;58;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;59;therapist;It sounds as though your list is like definitely a story. I-It kind of attracts you in the beginning as far as your health and the number two was being service. Number three. Uh—;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;60;client;Inner harmony.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;61;therapist;Inner harmony was number two, and having that peace of then to allow yourself to help other people or to serve-service.;reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;62;client;Right.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;63;therapist;Not being, you know, whatever you did for others. That being, um, as far as, like you said within yourself, that you won't be able to find, um, problems with helping other people. And, uh, that's when service which is your number three or number four, which has been wisdom. You learning different, you know, cultures and having that broad range of-of just opening your eyes and seeing the world in a whole another scope.And then five which being pleasure, which is also okay, I do see the whole world and I know that within myself that I'm able to, you know, accept that I will have things coming out of me as far as, you know, not being, you know, uh, it's like, okay, things might happen. You're gonna get bummed one day but finding joy and pieces [unintelligible 00:10:21];reflection;76;high;unidentifiable;64;client;Yeah.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;65;therapist;Well, it was nice talking to you.;other;76;high;unidentifiable;66;client;Yeah, it was nice being here and having you listen to me. Encouraging me was okay.;;neutral76;high;unidentifiable;67;therapist;Okay.;other;78;high;asthma management;0;therapist;Hi. Are you Julie Thompson?;question;78;high;asthma management;1;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;2;therapist;Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I work in the clinic and, uh, I noticed that you're in to pick up a prescription for Sarah's, uh, rescue inhaler-;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;3;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;4;therapist;-for her asthma. I noticed that she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. What's that- what's that been like for you?;question;78;high;asthma management;5;client;It's been- it's been really difficult. Um, I hate to see her gasping for breath. And, um, I'm really worried, you know, when she has to go. Uh, so that's been-- it's really difficult when I have to take her.;;change78;high;asthma management;6;therapist;Yeah, it sounds like you'd be willing to do whatever you can to try to prevent that from happening.;reflection;78;high;asthma management;7;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;change78;high;asthma management;8;therapist;Okay. I-I also noticed that, uh, it's been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;9;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;10;therapist;Are you having some difficulties with that?;other;78;high;asthma management;11;client;Well, I did research on the chronic inhaler and I found out that there were steroids in it and that-that I don't want her taking steroids. I did, uh, research on some of the potential side effects and some of the health problems that can result from taking steroids and I-I just don't want her to take those at all. I don't want her exposed to them at all. And then, uh, let me just go ahead and lay this out right now. Uh, because I'm sure it'll come up, but I-I do smoke. But I make sure that I do not smoke around her so that I make sure that it does not affect her. So-;;sustain78;high;asthma management;12;therapist;Okay.;other;78;high;asthma management;13;client;I just want to let you know that right off.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;14;therapist;Well, it sounds like you care about Sarah a great deal. You-you don't want her, uh, using steroids. You're worried about what kind of effects those would have on her and you're- you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma.;reflection;78;high;asthma management;15;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;16;therapist;Okay. Uh, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with, you know, the steroids because, you know, I certainly don't want her using a medicine that has steroids in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. Uh, can we talk about that just a little bit?;question;78;high;asthma management;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;18;therapist;Okay. Even though, uh, even though this medicine isn't the-the medicine that's in this is in the same broad family as the steroids you're worried about, and those are called anabolic steroids.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;19;client;Okay.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;20;therapist;Which build people up and have masculinizing effects.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;21;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;22;therapist;If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;23;client;Well, I-I guess I didn't realize that they weren't the same thing as the anabolic steroids.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;78;high;asthma management;25;client;Which are the ones that cause all the problems and everything. So, um, if-if you can assure me that it's not going to have those same side effects and health problems-;;change78;high;asthma management;26;therapist;"Yeah, def-definitely would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh.""";therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;28;therapist;You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;29;client;Okay.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;30;therapist;Do you mind if I talk to you a little bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency room?;question;78;high;asthma management;31;client;Yeah.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;32;therapist;Okay. When-when somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. If I could use an analogy, again, if-if you had the skin burnt off your arm, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned off your arm, it wouldn't bother you at all. But when the skin's burned off your arm, you literally react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on your arm would be if the skin got burned off. And what this drug can do? This chronic inhaler is reduce the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain exquisitely sensitive. Because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, in ways that it would not normally affect us.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;33;client;Oh, okay.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;34;therapist;And so this chronic inhaler can really prevent that from happening. Okay? Which is why it's so important to use it.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;35;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;36;therapist;The other thing I was going to tell you is that, unfortunately, uh, even though you are smoking outside and keeping the smoke away from her, the smoke on your clothes, because her lungs are so sensitive, can also affect her lungs and cause her to have a reaction. Now, something I'd like you to think about is that, if you use the chronic inhaler every day, she may not be sensitive to the smoke on your clothes, but she still maybe because her lungs are just very different than ours. Um, honestly, I'd love to see you quit smoking for you too because, you know, as you know, it's not real good for you.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;37;client;Yeah.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;38;therapist;Uh, and it would certainly help her. Um, but what I'd like you to do is to, kind of, keep an eye on what happens when she uses the chronic inhaler. And if she's still flaring up when you're around her, if there are any, if there is smoke on your clothes because it-it can flare her up.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;39;client;Oh, even when it's just on my clothes?;;neutral78;high;asthma management;40;therapist;Yeah. Yeah.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;41;client;She's that sensitive. If I realized that—;;neutral78;high;asthma management;42;therapist;It-it-it-- Yeah. It may not- it may not when she uses the chronic inhaler, uh, but you'll need to keep an eye on that. Obviously, it would be- what would be best if it didn't get on your clothes, or you quit smoking.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;43;client;Right. Um, so would it help, um-- You know, the thought of quitting smoking is a pretty daunting aspect.;;sustain78;high;asthma management;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;78;high;asthma management;45;client;I mean, I know people who've tried to quit and it's-it's just it's- it's really difficult, you know. So I know, it'd be better—;;sustain78;high;asthma management;46;therapist;Very hard. It's very relaxing, and-;reflection;78;high;asthma management;47;client;Yeah.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;48;therapist;And-and it's hard to replace it with something.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;49;client;Yeah, it is. Um.;;sustain78;high;asthma management;50;therapist;So, uh, any thoughts on what you may be able to do to-to help at this point, if you don't choose to quit right away?;question;78;high;asthma management;51;client;Well, I was thinking, um, if since it, you know, it affects her that it's on my clothes, if I only smoked while she was at school, and then changed my clothes before she came home. Would that help?;;change78;high;asthma management;52;therapist;Oh, that-that sounds like it would be great if you were able to do that. Obviously, don't smoke in the house, you know- you know.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;53;client;Oh, absolutely. I never. Never.;;change78;high;asthma management;54;therapist;Um, so yeah. If you're willing to do that, that certainly would help.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;55;client;Okay.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;56;therapist;Uh, again, if you get to the point sometime down the road where you're willing to quit for both you and her, uh, we'd be glad to help you do that. Because you're right it is- it's not an easy thing to do.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;57;client;Yeah. [chuckles];;neutral78;high;asthma management;58;therapist;Okay.;other;78;high;asthma management;59;client;It's really difficult.;;sustain78;high;asthma management;60;therapist;So it sounds like right now where we are, is you're willing to-to have her use the chronic inhaler-;reflection;78;high;asthma management;61;client;Mm-hmm.;;change78;high;asthma management;62;therapist;-to try to get the inflammation down, so she doesn't need to go to the emergency room and do whatever you can at this point to keep the smoke off your clothes. And I think you're gonna see big changes in terms of, uh, her not needing to go to the emergenc;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;63;client;Oh, really?;;neutral78;high;asthma management;64;therapist;Yeah, because you'll get that inflammation down.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;65;client;Oh, that's great-;;change78;high;asthma management;66;therapist;Okay.;other;78;high;asthma management;67;client;-because that's always scary when she has to use that one.;;change78;high;asthma management;68;therapist;Yeah. So we'll go ahead and get both of those prescriptions ready.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;69;client;Okay.;;neutral78;high;asthma management;70;therapist;Use the chronic inhaler every day, keep the rescue inhaler around if she needs it. Uh, and let's see how that works.;therapist_input;78;high;asthma management;71;client;Okay.;;change78;high;asthma management;72;therapist;Okay?;question;78;high;asthma management;73;client;That sounds good. Thank you.;;change78;high;asthma management;74;therapist;All right. Good.;other;79;high;managing life;0;client;Something clicked, I'd had a bunch to drink and, uh, and I knew I'd messed up. I totally messed up.;;neutral79;high;managing life;1;therapist;How did you know you messed up?;question;79;high;managing life;2;client;Because I was- because I was right there, man. I was right there in the same place when I'd come home and I'd pop a couple of those pills, it was the same deal, like and I wanted to stay there. I wanted to stay exactly right there. And I just felt like I'd ruined everything. You know, Erin's using the phone now, and he called me the next day and it was, uh, great, but I kinda felt ashamed of myself, and I don't want to feel that way again.;;change79;high;managing life;3;therapist;Was it that something happened, um, where you put something that was really important to you at risk? Is that what that was about, um, when you say you felt guilty, uh, you felt bad talking to Erin on the phone?;reflection;79;high;managing life;4;client;Because of what-- Yeah, I guess, I think that's what I mean, yeah, yeah. Because you know, I mean- I mean I could have stayed, I could have got, I could have got absolutely hammered and I could have done it every night for the rest of the week.;;change79;high;managing life;5;therapist;So you saw yourself putting something that was important to you at risk.;reflection;79;high;managing life;6;client;But I don't know if I stopped because I knew I had to stop or because, you know, it was like right there, that's where I wanted to stay, you know? Anyway, I just, uh-- [crosstalk].;;change79;high;managing life;7;therapist;Here you are actually, three months on, three long months as you say, um, and things have been going really well, Uh, you even get a bit of—;reflection;79;high;managing life;8;client;They're better, yeah.;;change79;high;managing life;9;therapist;Yeah. Well, and then you get the kind of, I don't know if it felt like a green light or a yellow, it went from red to cautionary, you could see your kids, and that was something that was really what you were working for.;reflection;79;high;managing life;10;client;Yeah, yeah.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Jean, it's good to see you again.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Hello, doctor.;;neutral80;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;So, what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago?;question;80;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I did what we discussed. I did the journal-;;change80;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;5;client;-for a week, uh, trying to mark down the-the difference in my smoking, being more aware when I had the urge, if I could stop the urge-;;change80;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Mm.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;7;client;-and I found it was okay. It got a little bit scary on the weekend because, uh, uh, the urge has kept on coming-;;change80;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Sure.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;9;client;to have a cigarette.;;neutral80;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Sure.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;11;client;But during the week, I was able to cut down at least two or three cigarettes a week, and that's just in one week. So-;;change80;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;So, you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes? That's amazing. I mean, given how much you were smoking.;reflection;80;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Yeah.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;So, you were able to keep the, uh, the journal?;question;80;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Yes.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;You-- Sounds like you did that, and that allowed you to really focus on the time [unintelligible 00:00:57] delaying your cigarettes. So-so that's gone well. So, what are the things that are not going as well as you'd liked?;therapist_input;80;high;smoking cessation;17;client;It just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend-;;neutral80;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Right.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;19;client;-and I was going out with friends and I was home a lot of the day-;;neutral80;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Yeah.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;21;client;-instead of at work. And I found that, um, it was really hard to stop those urges.;;neutral80;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Okay. So, these automatic cigarettes, when you're socializing and you're-- you have time on your hands, really, are the problems that you're facing-;reflection;80;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Yes.;;neutral80;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;-uh, and that you've noticed are more difficult than the others?;question;80;high;smoking cessation;25;client;But I marked it in the book. Uh, that's one thing I said to myself, I'll be honest in my marking down.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;In marking it down, okay.;reflection;80;high;smoking cessation;27;client;So, I'm gonna have to really be aware of the weekends. Maybe get some kind of hobby or-or join some group or something on the weekends to keep me busy.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Okay. So, and you've thought about already, what you might do, such as getting a hobby. Any other thoughts of what you might do to help you overcome this?;question;80;high;smoking cessation;29;client;If I can just postpone it-;;change80;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Okay.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;31;client;"-and-and say, ""Okay, I'm not gonna have it at home-";;change80;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Right.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;33;client;"-I'll have it when I get to work or on the way to work.""";;change80;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Right.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;35;client;'Cause I-I-I-;;neutral80;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Sure.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;37;client;And then, uh-uh, what I'd like to do is try not to smoke in my house.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay. So, from now to the next time you come back and see me, what is it that you'd like to-to work on?;therapist_input;80;high;smoking cessation;39;client;I think I'd just like to do what I did this first week. I liked the idea of marking it down.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Okay, so you can continue with that.;therapist_input;80;high;smoking cessation;41;client;I-- And it took me a week and I'm down two cigarettes a day, I-I figure.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Sure.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;43;client;What I'd like to do is maybe go down to five cigarettes, in other words, another three a day.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Okay.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;45;client;And, um, 'cause I smoke a large pack and small pack, maybe just two small packs.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;You said five cigarettes this time.;therapist_input;80;high;smoking cessation;47;client;Yes.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;48;therapist;And any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen?;question;80;high;smoking cessation;49;client;I can try each day to count.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;50;therapist;Right.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;51;client;And I'm still gonna try that when I get the urge to let it go, fight it, and maybe not go out for a cigarette until the next urge comes.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;52;therapist;Right. [unintelligible 00:02:58];other;80;high;smoking cessation;53;client;So, if I [unintelligible 00:02:59] between two of them-;;change80;high;smoking cessation;54;therapist;Sure.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;55;client;-and also coming back and-and talking to you really helps 'cause I have someone to-;;change80;high;smoking cessation;56;therapist;Sure.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;57;client;discuss it with.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;58;therapist;So, given what you're-you're attempting to do, when would it be good for you to come back and talk about this?;question;80;high;smoking cessation;59;client;I wouldn't mind coming back in a week again because this is all new and-and a week, I can handle a week.;;change80;high;smoking cessation;60;therapist;Absolutely. Okay.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;61;client;Okay, thank you doctor.;;neutral80;high;smoking cessation;62;therapist;Good. So, we'll see you in a week.;other;80;high;smoking cessation;63;client;Yes, thank you.;;neutral81;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Did you like how your parents raised you?;question;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;therapist;Tell me about how your parents raised you?;question;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Tell me about how you've been feeling?;question;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Okay. I guess I've been getting bigger.;;neutral81;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Mm, what's that like for you?;question;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Uh, scary I guess.;;sustain81;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;So you're feeling uncomfortable with changes in your body?;reflection;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Yeah. I-I know there's something in there, I just don't know much about him.;;neutral81;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;Mm.;other;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;I know you want me to see the doctor, I haven't called yet.;;sustain81;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Why do you think it makes you so hesitant to call?;question;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;I don't know. It seems overwhelming to me.;;sustain81;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;What about it seems overwhelming?;question;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;Well, I hate making phone calls and I know I need to fill out all this paperwork. I don't know how to get there and I hate needles.;;sustain81;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;Mm. So some of your feelings, uh, of being overwhelmed or about the logistics of the appointment, and some of it is you just don't like medical appointments and medical people?;reflection;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;Yes.;;neutral81;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;therapist;How can I help you with these things?;question;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;client;Can you help me make the call?;;change81;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;therapist;Sure, we can do that together.;other;81;high;adhering to medical procedure;19;client;Can you go with me to the appointment.;;change81;high;adhering to medical procedure;20;therapist;I can try. I can't guarantee because it depends on my schedule, but we can brainstorm about ideas on who can go with you to support you so you feel better about attending.;therapist_input;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Would you like to answer some questions and kind of do a self-evaluation about how you're feeling around alcohol and the contraception?;question;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Sure.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Okay. So we're working on a 10 point of scale 1 to 10, 1 being not important, 10 being very important. One being not confident, one being very confident. So on a scale of 1 to 10, which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the-- what risk limits?;question;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;I would say an eight.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;You'd say an eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels?;question;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;I would say a four.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Amount of four.;reflection;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. And so let's look at those two. You're-you're thinking it's pretty important, but your confidence is down here, uh, a four, but it's not a one. What makes you confident that you can drink below risk levels and you remember what those are?;question;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, I think it's because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family and I really don't want to go down that path. So I'm-I'm confident that I can change that at this point.;;change82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Okay. So that gives you a good reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?;question;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Um, well, I have a group of friends that doesn't drink that I hang out with. And I think when I hang out with them, it's not an issue. So that also helps me.;;change82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk levels?;reflection;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yep.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Okay. Anything else?;question;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Nope.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Now let's look at your self-evaluation of your birth control. So now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control. So on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant?;question;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I would say an eight.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;An eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you- that you can use effective birth control?;question;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Every time,-;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Every time.;therapist_input;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;probably a six.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Correctly as it's prescribed.;therapist_input;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Probably a six.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Probably a six. Okay. So you're pretty confident that you can do it. And why are you a six and not a two or three?;question;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Um, I'm a six because I think if I drink less, I'll be more reliable with using birth control. I tend to not use it when I'm-- I drank too much and I don't really care too much.;;change82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay. So it's kind of linked to your drinking, the fact that, um, that you can-- if you can take care of that drinking, you can take care of the-;reflection;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;-birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here.;reflection;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yes.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Very good. So it looks like, um, you're using a good method of birth control, you're just not able to use it effectively. And you've linked it back here to the drinking. So would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use at this-- today?;question;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Before I leave?;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Yes.;other;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Okay.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Okay. And if you need more information, we can get that for you.;therapist_input;82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Okay.;;neutral82;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hello, Rick. Welcome.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Kia ora.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Good to see you here. I see on your file that you're, uh, [unintelligible 00:01:18].;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Yup.

Country boy.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;Country boy. Been up in Christchurch how long?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;I've been up here since I was 18.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;therapist;Oh, so you've been here a while?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;client;Just a little while. Yeah.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;therapist;Oh good. You got family out here?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;19;client;Uh, just my own.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;20;therapist;Just your own whānau here. [unintelligible 00:01:51]. Well, Rick, I'm sort of, uh, interested in that, you know, you and I are gonna been doing some work together for a while. I'm sort of wondering what sort of thoughts you'd be having on your way here today.;therapist_input;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;21;client;Um, I was thinking about what you might ask me, what I would say. I'm thinking about my kids, thinking about having to take a day off work.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;22;therapist;Right.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;23;client;It's a bit of a bitch.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;24;therapist;Okay. I see you've had a bit of experience with, uh, coming to prevention services.;therapist_input;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;25;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;26;therapist;What's that been like for you in the past?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;27;client;Uh, it's been okay. Um, it hasn't been bad.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;28;therapist;Right.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;29;client;I don't know. Kind of nothing, really.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;30;therapist;Okay. Similar sort of offending in the past that's brought you back again this time?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;31;client;Yeah.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;32;therapist;One of the, um, things that I've learned over the years, Rick, is that a lot of guys get to the doors out there and don't come inside and, um, you've come inside. What does that tell me about you?;therapist_input;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;33;client;Um, I hope that it says that I want to, um, make some changes.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;34;therapist;Yeah.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;35;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;36;therapist;So is that different from when you've come in here before?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;37;client;Yeah. And I still had to walk through those doors so-;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;38;therapist;Yeah.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;39;client;-but, um, I just think about my kids, you know.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;40;therapist;Yeah. So they're really important to you?;reflection;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;41;client;Yeah.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;42;therapist;Yeah. And do you have your kids with you full-time or-;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;43;client;No. No, I don't. I see them, um, once a fortnight.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;44;therapist;Okay. And what's it like for you?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;45;client;It sucks.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;46;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;47;client;Yeah.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;48;therapist;What would you really like to happen in terms of, uh, you and your children?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;49;client;I just-- I'd love to be able to see them whenever I can, whenever I wanted to.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;50;therapist;Yeah.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;51;client;You know. I, um, they're my whole world and-and I've fucked things up.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;52;therapist;Right.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;53;client;So, you know.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;54;therapist;So coming along to see me and you and I are doing some work together, then you're going on to do a program, how important is that gonna be for you and your children?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;55;client;It's really important.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;56;therapist;Mm-hmm. If I was to put it on a scale of say 1 to 100, 1 being not really important, 100 being really, really important, whereabouts on that scale would you you be?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;57;client;It's, uh, um, it's hard because-because I'm, uh, I'm not a bad person. I've just done some stupid shit, but I'm not a bad person.;;sustain83;high;adhering to medical procedure;58;therapist;Right.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;59;client;In-in regards to my kids, I'd be100- 100%.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;60;therapist;Right.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;61;client;If it means say, I can have my-- see my kids whenever I- whenever I want.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;62;therapist;Yeah. What do you think it'd be like for your kids if they were sitting here now and they heard you say that this was really, really important to you and to them? That you gave this program 100%. Well, then what might that be like for them to hear that?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;63;client;Um, I-I-I'd hope that they'd be proud of me. I wouldn't want my kids to see me- to see me here though. But I- But I hope they would be proud of me.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;64;therapist;Okay.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;65;client;'Cause I'm-- Yeah.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;66;therapist;Good. Anybody else in your family that would be really proud of-- that you're taking these steps?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;67;client;Um, oh, my mom.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;68;therapist;Yeah. Your is mum still down south?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;69;client;Yeah.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;70;therapist;Yeah. Does she know that you're here today?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;71;client;No.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;72;therapist;So how might it be for her if she knew that you're talking like this today? That-- 'Cause it sounds to me like you're really serious this time making some changes.;reflection;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;73;client;Yeah, I am.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;74;therapist;Yeah.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;75;client;I just, um, I don't- don't know where to s-- where to start. I don't know.;;sustain83;high;adhering to medical procedure;76;therapist;So do you think doing this program and completing this program this time would be a good place to start?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;77;client;Yeah, I hope so. I-- So I would genuinely want to, I genuinely want to do something to help myself. I don't deliberately fuck things up for myself.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;78;therapist;Yeah. So you and I are going to be doing a little bit of work together then. And, um, and sometimes it-it can get quite tough. And I'm just wondering before we go any further, when the going gets tough, a lot of guys bail out. I'm just wondering are you one of those guys?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;79;client;No, this is important to me.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;80;therapist;Right.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;81;client;I have, um, I've-- it's important to me.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;82;therapist;Good. One of the other things we're really conscious of with is, um, sometimes we do this work in isolation from others. And one of the things we want to ask people is about who they're going to be accountable to. I'm thinking like with your children, uh, your mom and other people that maybe you're interacting with. Who-who else in your life do you think would be supportive of you, and who would you need to let them know that you're actually going through this sort of program?;therapist_input;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;83;client;I, um, I'm separated at the moment from my missus and-;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;84;therapist;What was-- what was your partner's name?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;85;client;Uh, Kirsty.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;86;therapist;Kristy.;reflection;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;87;client;I would- I would love f-f-for her to know that I'm doing this and for her to know that I mean it, but, um, I know she wouldn't give a shit right now actually.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;88;therapist;Right. In terms of your employer, would they be supportive?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;89;client;Uh, yeah, I don't know. Maybe, but I don't know if I want them to know though.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;90;therapist;Okay. What do you think it might be like for you to explore that with them?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;91;client;Uh, I don't know.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;92;therapist;Any other family members that, uh, live close that, uh, you think would be supportive?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;93;client;I'm pretty much by myself up here.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;94;therapist;Okay. The reason why I'm asking this, Rick, is just, um, you know, part of, um, uh, being responsible is turning up and doing the program.;therapist_input;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;95;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;96;therapist;The other aspect of that is kind of like who we're going to be accountable to while we're doing the program. So one of the- one of the challenges, one of the riddle I'm going to put in front of you is like who else can we get involved to support you while you're going through this?;therapist_input;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;97;client;Um, I don't know. I don't, um, have that many people-;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;98;therapist;Okay.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;99;client;-that I am-- I don't have that many people I trust to support me. My mates, I love them but, um, yeah, I don't know.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;100;therapist;Okay. So as we're gonna do this work together and go through this, uh, this program, one of the things we-we don't want to do is fall into the same trough we did last time. So I-I just want to leave that with you to think about next time we come together. There may be two or three other people that you think of that can be really supportive, that we-we need to let know that you're [unintelligible 00:10:50] each gonna make these changes and this time, you're serious about it. So let your mother and, uh, and, um, your partner, how might that happen? How does that sound to you?;therapist_input;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;101;client;Yeah, let's give it some thought.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;102;therapist;Rick, I get a sense that you're kind of padding this walk a little bit on your own at the moment. Would that be true?;reflection;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;103;client;Yeah. That'll definitely be true.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;104;therapist;Your family is down south. I mean,who-who-who else do you think would be really interested in sup-supporting you, rowing with you if you like on this journey?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;105;client;Uh, I have a good relationship with my mum,-;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;106;therapist;Okay.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;107;client;with my brothers and sisters.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;108;therapist;Yeah.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;109;client;My mum is actually pretty important to me.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;110;therapist;Yeah. How would it be for your mum, do you think, if you were to tell her that this is something that you're-- is really important for you and that you know that this time you really need to do this for her and for the family? What-what might that be like for her to hear?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;111;client;I think she'd be proud of me.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;112;therapist;Yeah. All right.;other;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;113;client;Yeah.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;114;therapist;Brothers and sisters, that, uh, would also be very supportive if you were to make this journey?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;115;client;Yeah. Yeah. A good, uh, good family.;;neutral83;high;adhering to medical procedure;116;therapist;Good. So how would you go about getting them to support you, to come on board, and be accountable to doing this work together?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;117;client;Um, I don't know. Um, have some-somebody just to listen.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;118;therapist;And, um, I’m just trying to imagine what do you think your mom would want to say to you if she was sitting here with us now and she heard you talking about this?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;119;client;She would- she would tell me that she loves me. She would tell me that she believes that I could do it.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;120;therapist;Mm. What do you think she might want for you, like upon her for your children?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;121;client;For them to have a father they can look up to.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;122;therapist;I’m getting a strong sense that's what you want as well.;reflection;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;123;client;It is what I want. Definitely.;;change83;high;adhering to medical procedure;124;therapist;So, in terms of having the confidence to do this with the support of your whānau and ours, where do you think your confidence level might be now?;question;83;high;adhering to medical procedure;125;client;If I had their support of my-my family and [silence] I want to say that would be higher.

Normally what I do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week-;therapist_input;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;-and then we just talk together about that. So, um, but I always like to just start with wherever you would like to start as well.;therapist_input;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Um, yeah, I, [sigh] that, I mean, like, when I was doing those questionnaires, it was weird because, I mean, I guess I don't really think about, like, you know, the drinking being, like, this huge deal and I don't-;;neutral87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;-ever really think about, like-like, how much I drink.;;neutral87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Um, and, like, fi- like filling out, like, how much I'm drinking every day, it was like, whoa, you know-;;neutral87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Hm.;other;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;-like, I just didn't ever really think about it, like, that I was-- like, if I try to actually count the drinks, it's, kind of, a lot, I mean, it's, kind of, a lot.;;change87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;You were pretty shocked at what you learned about your patterns.;reflection;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Well, yeah, 'cause, like, I also, kind of, thought that, like, I drink, like, about as much as my friends did and then, like, I went back and I was, like, talking to my roommate about it and I was, like, telling her that, you know, I was drinking, like, like 10 drinks on the weekends, like, including Thursday, so like, Thursday, Friday-;;neutral87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Hm.;other;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;-Saturday, Sunday.;;neutral87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;"And then she was like, ""Sarah, that's cra-- Like, that is crazy. Why are, you know, like, where are you drinking this?"" And I was- I was like, ""Well, you know, like, different places."" And I-I guess, like, I don't know, my friends didn't, like, know. Anyway, it's, yeah, I don't know.";;neutral87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Yeah, this information has opened your eyes in some ways and as you talked to your roommate about it, she was even shocked to know that you were drinking as much as you- as you realized when you did the questionnaire.;reflection;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah, and yeah, I guess it was just like, I thought that everybody was, like, doing it, you know-;;change87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;-but that's not really what was going on. [chuckles];;change87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Yeah, the fact that your drinking stands out from others is clearly not something you had ever really taken into consideration before?;reflection;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yeah.;;change87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah, so, that was the thing that, like, was really the most weird about doing those-;;change87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay.;other;87;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;forms.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;0;client;For me.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;1;therapist;So, um, everyone that comes on the South Whisky program, we'd like them to pick at least three goals that they'd like to work on in the next 30 days. Because what we will do is we will monitor you and we'll check in 30 days to see how you're going with your goals. So with that being said, we want you to pick something that is relevant for you, something that you're willing to work on. So with that being said, is there anything that you would like to change your work on either at home or school, um, [unintelligible 00:00:30]?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;2;client;Um, I have to start getting the school on time for my first hour. I always miss that class.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;3;therapist;Okay, so for you getting on time for first hour is something you'd like to work on the next 30 days?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;4;client;Yes.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;5;therapist;Okay. What a great goal. So why do you want to make this goal for yourself?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;6;client;Uh, so people will get off my back.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;7;therapist;And who are these people?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;8;client;My mom she's always saying, you know, get to school. My PO will be like, you know, if you don't get the school on time, I can bring you back in for sanctions and I don't want to go back in.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;9;therapist;So that's something you definitely wanna avoid?;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;10;client;Yes.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;11;therapist;Okay. So getting to school for your first hour is something that you're going to work on as your goal.;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;12;client;I will try.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;13;therapist;So what are some specific steps you would need to take to get to school on time for first hour?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;14;client;I can't ever get up in the morning. So that's hard and then by the time I do get up, and then I get ready and get dressed, I miss the bus. So then I usually end up walking or see if I can find a ride. So it could be a bunch of different reasons why I'm late.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;15;therapist;Okay, so it's not just one major thing?;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;16;client;No.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;17;therapist;So knowing that a couple of things can really get in your way, what do you think would work best for you to get to school on time? What do you know you need to do?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;18;client;Get up on time would probably be a good start of making me get there on time.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;19;therapist;What time would you need to get up then?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;20;client;[sighs] If I'm gonna catch the bus I'll probably need to be up by 6:15 and sometimes that's just so hard to do, 'cause I go to bed so late and I don't know if I can do it.;;sustain88;high;compliance with rules;21;therapist;So you're still kind of unsure if this is something that you could do yet you're saying you really wanna do it because you don't wanna go back for sanctions.;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;22;client;Right. I could try-;;change88;high;compliance with rules;23;therapist;Okay.;other;88;high;compliance with rules;24;client; and see how it goes.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;25;therapist;Okay, so you're willing to at least attempt it?;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;26;client;Yes.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;27;therapist;So what time would you have to go to bed at night to make sure you're up by 6:15?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;28;client;I go about midnight now, so if I tried maybe 11:00. I can try 11:00.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;29;therapist;Okay. Okay, so you're willing to go to bed at 11:00 and then you're going to set your alarm for 6:15 the next morning?;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;30;client;Yes.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;31;therapist;When would be a great day for you to start this?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;32;client;Uh, either tomorrow or the next day.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;33;therapist;Okay, so if I would write down here, um, what do you think- what would you want me to write? Tomorrow or the next day?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;34;client;Let's start tomorrow.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;35;therapist;Tomorrow. Okay, great. So who would be able to help you get to bed on time and make sure you're up on time by 6:15?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;36;client;My mom.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;37;therapist;Your mom.;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;38;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;39;therapist;Okay. Anything that your mom could do to help you with that?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;40;client;[sighs] She can after my alarm goes off, if I don't get up, she could come in and wake me up and remind me that I said to you that I'm going to get up so that I have to do it.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;41;therapist;"So it's almost like you want your mom to make it say that this is for you. It's not because your mom's making you get up like you want your mom to remind you, ""Hey, remember, this is something that you want for yourself is to be in time for first-hour class"".";reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;42;client;Exactly. Yup.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;43;therapist;Great. What could maybe get in the way of you not getting up by 6:15?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;44;client;[sighs] Not going to bed on time.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;45;therapist;Not going to bed on time.;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;46;client;Yup, that's gonna be a struggle for me.;;sustain88;high;compliance with rules;47;therapist;Okay. So if you are feeling tempted to stay up later-;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;48;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;49;therapist; how could you respond instead?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;50;client;Just go to bed and turn off the lights, don't have my phone.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;51;therapist;Okay, so a phone is a distraction for you. So keeping your phone away-;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;52;client;Oh, yeah.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;53;therapist;- and even actually turning the lights off and making sure that it's dark?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;54;client;Yes.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;55;therapist;Kind of a reminder it's time to go to bed.;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;56;client;Have my mom check on me to make sure everything's put away.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;57;therapist;And-and also the support of your mom too.;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;58;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;59;therapist;Great. So how will you know that you-your plan is working?;question;88;high;compliance with rules;60;client;When I'm at school on time, when the bell rings and I'm in class.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;61;therapist;So for you being in your class, when that bell rings, then you know, this is the goal.;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;62;client;Absolutely.;;neutral88;high;compliance with rules;63;therapist;So what I've been hearing so far- what again, what a great goal. You've already had some insight of how to do this. So for you, it's really important that you're getting to your first hour because you don't want to go back to sanction days. You don't having- like having all these extra people checking up on you and all those things.You've already have a plan of going to bed by 11:00, turning off the lights, putting your cell phone away. Even the support of your mom is really gonna be helpful for you, um, getting up at 6:15 in the morning with that alarm. I know that seems really early in the morning, but you seem willing to do it. And if you're not able to do it, your mom's gonna help you out as well.;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;64;client;Well, yeah, I hope so.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;65;therapist;What a great plan and you said you're going to start tomorrow.;reflection;88;high;compliance with rules;66;client;I'll give it a try.;;change88;high;compliance with rules;67;therapist;Great. Well, thank you.;other;88;high;compliance with rules;68;client;You're welcome.;;neutral90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So, Tommy, I wanted to talk to because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party, and, you know, you're such a good kid. Like, I don't know what you're doing drinking. It's going to ruin your life.;therapist_input;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Um, I mean, it was just the, like a social gathering. It wasn't like I was looking for it, uh, the drinks were there and I-- all my friends were doing it and it was just-- it's-it's not something that I like do occa- on occasion, but whenever the opportunity presents itself, it-it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes.;;sustain90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;But, Tommy, there's so many consequences with drinking. You know, you're not even 21 yet, you could get arrested, you could, you know, have a drunk driving accident. You could, you know, mess up your schoolwork. You have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really, really concerns me.;therapist_input;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;I-I get what you're coming from, but I-I-I really did. I-I thought that I had it under control and I didn't let myself get too far gone. I-I didn't want to be, um, how do I put this? Like, I want it to be in control and I wanted to make sure that all my friends were okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much.;;neutral90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much, you know. Like, think about it, think about all the things that can happen to you.;therapist_input;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah. I-I understand exactly what you're saying. And—;;neutral90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;How much are you drinking?;question;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;I-I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean, it's-it's mainly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever. It's just the—;;sustain90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Is it like every weekend?;question;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Every other weekends, I would say.;;neutral90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Tommy, I'm just so concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do?;question;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Um, I-I guess I can. I-I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I-I do get you're coming from and—;;change90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Yeah. Is-- are your friends the problem, like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you were partying with?;therapist_input;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself. I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps just to-- just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can.;;neutral90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and-and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.;therapist_input;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Mm. Yeah. I-I-I do see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to-to a certain degree. And I-- it does make a lot of sense. And I-I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking that—;;change90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;I think you really need to quit.;therapist_input;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah. I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me, wherever I go and parties and stuff that. I-I kind of feel like I should just, uh, get used to it or at least understand its, uh, its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't- I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.;;neutral90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;I think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, um, I wish you would quit. If all you're going to do is cut down, that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. It's really important.;therapist_input;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Yeah. I-I-I just-- I don't see the problem in it right now and maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic of an experience but I'm—;;sustain90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Do you wanna wait for that happen? Do you wanna wait for a dramatic experience?;question;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;You're-you're right. I-I don't want- I don't wanna be too far gone before it's too late. Like I-I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I-I guess I've never really had any-any real experience where the alcohol has really affected me that much or affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.;;change90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking.;therapist_input;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah. I-I think that that would be a good step forward into-- and a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true- the true aspects of life rather than the-the haziness of alcohol.;;change90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay, sounds good.;other;90;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Okay.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hi, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Good morning, doctor.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;How can I help you today?;question;91;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, doctor, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, COPD.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Yes.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;5;client;And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Right.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;7;client;So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;It's time to do something, okay. So you've been diagnosed by-;question;91;high;smoking cessation;9;client;A respirologist.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now?;question;91;high;smoking cessation;11;client;I'm- I'm really scared, uh, 'cause I don't feel well.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;13;client;I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;All right. So it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened.;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?;question;91;high;smoking cessation;17;client;I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself.;;sustain91;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing.;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;19;client;I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;21;client;I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital.;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;23;client;I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked.;;sustain91;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Okay. Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you?;question;91;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television. Everybody looked so grand.;;sustain91;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's good for my nerves.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Right.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;29;client;"I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, ""Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.""";;sustain91;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;31;client;That's right.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Okay. Is there anything I missed?;question;91;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Um, I enjoy it. It just- it relaxes me. It's great after a meal, um, for me-;;sustain91;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;35;client;-we all just do it as a little group of people, uh, my family.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Right.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;37;client;The people I work with, we go out in the courtyard-;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Sure.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;39;client;-have a cigarette and talk. That's how you make friends. A lot of people, um, we're like a little group now, we're all- a little bunch of us.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;So it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you is smoking. And it's so easy to go out and take a break and have a cigarette.;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;41;client;I-I never thought of it that way, but probably you're right.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;You've told me what is good about smoking for you. Uh, can you tell me what is not so good about smoking for you?;question;91;high;smoking cessation;43;client;Well, it's bad for my health and it's scaring me 'cause I don't feel well.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;45;client;I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Is there anything else that's not good about smoking for you?;question;91;high;smoking cessation;47;client;Um, it's expensive, really got expensive, and I smoked 30, 40, sometimes 50 cigarettes a day. And I'm starting to buy different makeup 'cause I'm starting to really age, starting to get lines in my face and wrinkles and my skin is getting really clogged up and I'm spending a fortune on cosmetics.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;48;therapist;Okay. So let me make sure I've understood this piece as well. So the not good things or the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health, effects on your physical appearance and how you'll look and-and-and the amount of investment that you're making in makeup and getting your nails done, et cetera. And then the cost of smoking.;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;49;client;Yes.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;50;therapist;So-so let me ask you this, given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the most important thing to do, and 1 would be the least important thing to do, how important is it for you to quit smoking?;question;91;high;smoking cessation;51;client;It's for me, for my health, and for the money and everything I've said, I would say it's 10 or- out of 10 that I should quit smoking.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;52;therapist;Definitely most important.;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;53;client;Yes. A hundred percent, one of the most important things.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;54;therapist;Let me ask another question and follow up to that. Again, given everything going on, where 10 is the most confident you've ever felt about anything and 1 is the least confident, how confident are you that you will be able to quit?;question;91;high;smoking cessation;55;client;Um, I, I'd say 35 or 40% competent.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;56;therapist;35-40%. Okay.;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;57;client;Yeah. I'd like to say more, but, um-;;change91;high;smoking cessation;58;therapist;Okay. Now, help me understand why you said 40 and not something like 10 or zero because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit.;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;59;client;Well, I'm- I guess I'm still a fighter, and I-I-I- it's starting to- I'm starting to realize it and I do feel pretty good that I came to see you. I-I- it was a step and a couple of people who care about me actually, uh, gave me a pat on the back that I came to see you. So-;;change91;high;smoking cessation;60;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;61;client;-this was a big step. So I guess, yes. Um, it wouldn't have been as high maybe last week.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;62;therapist;Okay. So you said 30 to 40%. What would it take to build that confidence to about 45%?;question;91;high;smoking cessation;63;client;Maybe if I could come to see you again, or maybe some ideas were suggested, maybe if there was a group or something. I-I don't know, but I-I need some help.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;64;therapist;So if you got help, that would help you say that you went from 40% to 45%.;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;65;client;I-I think so because I feel a little better that I just came to see you today.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;66;therapist;Okay.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;67;client;Discussing things helps me. I always feel better when I get things out.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;68;therapist;Okay. So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step. What are your thoughts about that?;therapist_input;91;high;smoking cessation;69;client;In other words, think about it more, don't- don't just do it automatically.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;70;therapist;That's correct. And writing it down helps that process.;therapist_input;91;high;smoking cessation;71;client;Yeah, yeah. I think so because, um, when I get the urge, I could maybe fight it and, um, maybe wait till the next urge-;;change91;high;smoking cessation;72;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;91;high;smoking cessation;73;client;-and maybe mark that down that, uh, I didn't go right away when something went wrong. Um, yes, I-I can try that.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;74;therapist;Okay. And I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it. And if you can bring that back to the next appointment, it could be something we could discuss. Okay. Anything else?;therapist_input;91;high;smoking cessation;75;client;No, that gives me something to work towards until I see you next week.;;change91;high;smoking cessation;76;therapist;Excellent. Well, thank you so much for coming in today.;reflection;91;high;smoking cessation;77;client;Thank you for seeing me, doctor.;;neutral91;high;smoking cessation;78;therapist;You're welcome.;other;93;high;managing life;0;therapist;So there are a lot of different directions that we could take. Um, you've mentioned wanting to make changes in your physical activity. You've mentioned wanting to make changes in your eating habits and also just wanting more body confidence. Um, what- what's on your mind is as far as a- as a change topic for the rest of our session today?;reflection;93;high;managing life;1;client;I think the activity piece is the kind of low-hanging fruit that I see. Um, I feel like it's gonna be harder for me to change some of my nutrition habits right out the gate, but if I can get into maybe an activity routine, that that could be good to help maybe some of the other changes happen later.;;change93;high;managing life;2;therapist;Yeah. Okay. So physical activity is feeling like the easiest change to look at first.;reflection;93;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah, I think so.;;neutral93;high;managing life;4;therapist;Great. So tell me a little bit more about your motivators for getting started in being more physically active. I know you shared energy levels and I know you've shared, um, that you'd like to see a boost in your mood and feeling less irritable and stressed. Any other benefits that really make you wanna make this change right now?;reflection;93;high;managing life;5;client;Yeah, I think just to feeling like physically stronger, um, like physically more able. Uh, last night I like struggled with the jar of salsa, like opening it. So I think that just stuff like that, um, you know, would be in addition to mood and being more productive and energy and all that stuff. Um, yeah, that that would be a definite end goal for me too. And then really to like, I think if I am more active, I think my body image or my body confidence would improve also.;;change93;high;managing life;6;therapist;Yeah. So you're wanting to feel stronger so that you can open jars and other things and- and also just have a better sense of confidence.;reflection;93;high;managing life;7;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral93;high;managing life;8;therapist;Great. So on a scale from zero to 10, zero being not at all ready to make a change in the area of physical activity, and 10 being let's- let's do this. I'm excited. I'm ready. Um, where- where do you fall on that scale?;question;93;high;managing life;9;client;Hmm, I'd say I'm about an eight.;;neutral93;high;managing life;10;therapist;Okay. So you're- you're feeling fairly motivated.;reflection;93;high;managing life;11;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral93;high;managing life;12;therapist;Uh, why didn't you pick a six?;question;93;high;managing life;13;client;Well, like I said, I just, I've identified like a lot of things that I think would be good. Um, if I were to be more active and I definitely wanna have that improved mood and energy, um, and feel better about myself. Um, so yeah, all of those things I think are what's really driving that- that rating.;;change93;high;managing life;14;therapist;Okay. You're noticing there- there are too many great benefits to being physically active and, um, today you've mentioned energy, mood, strength and body confidence.;reflection;93;high;managing life;15;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral93;high;managing life;16;therapist;Am I missing anything else?;question;93;high;managing life;17;client;I don't think so.;;neutral93;high;managing life;18;therapist;Okay. Those are the big ones for you.;reflection;93;high;managing life;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral93;high;managing life;20;therapist;Fantastic. Well, um, now we can start looking at if you're interested in how that might look-;therapist_input;93;high;managing life;21;client;Mm-hmm, yeah.;;neutral93;high;managing life;22;therapist;- and- and what activities you might end up, um, choosing.;other;93;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah, that'd be great.;;neutral93;high;managing life;24;therapist;Okay.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;Good, so, um, we're here today to talk just, uh, about whatever it is you'd like to talk about it.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;Um, how about if we talk about, uh, the problem that I'm really having is, um, getting somebody motivated to do something, um, such as move out of my house.;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;Okay, so, um, there would be, so what you're, what you're attempting to do is, um, well-- Tell me, I guess, uh, tell me a little bit more about it so I understand it a little bit more.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;Well, I-I offered my home to somebody and, uh, for, you know, uh, a transitional period.;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;You know, and it seems that, um, it's hard for me to be assertive and say I think the, um, the, uh, transitional period is- has come and it's beginning to time to transition. So.;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;So that's a really kind thing of you to do to take someone into your home like that when they need help like that. And, um, but right now, you're thinking that, uh, time is up you'd like to get this person, you know, you're-you're-you're ready to have him or her move out and have your place back to yourself.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;Yeah, that's, it's absolutely right that I want, I-I want change but I'm not, I am kind of, like, weak in that area where it's, like, the ability to actually say the words. You're right, yeah. I'd like to be able to do that.;;change94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;Mm-hmm. And what would, uh, what would help you get to the point of actually, um, booting them out?;question;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;Um. [sighs] I don't know, I'm-I'm, I guess, I'm kind of, um, I care about the person and, you know, there's a certain amount of comfortability of having somebody with you, you know, and I'm just, so, I guess I am at war with myself because part of me wants the comfort of having a companion and the other part of me is just, you know-- I-I cannot-- I am not really sure what I wanna do, you know.;;sustain94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. So you kind of feel two ways about it. You-you'd like to, um, you feel like at some level that the time is up for that person to go, and on the other hand, there's a certain amount of security in having him in the house and in knowing he's around.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;client;Yeah, you know, it's kind of, like, the old sock- song saying hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more. [laughs] And—;;change94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;therapist;But you're not quite ready if you wanna sing that song.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;client;[laughs] Well, first of all I think he would hit the road if I started singing that song 'cause I can sing. [laughs];;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;therapist;I thought you did a pretty nice job singing there right there, it's scary to be quite honest with you and I appreciate, I also appreciate your sense of humor in-in doing that.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;client;Well, you know, in life you have to have a sense of humor in my- the way I view and otherwise, you know, I'd be like where's the news. [laughs] I mean, it's either—;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;therapist;That really helps you get through things is to be able to laugh about it.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;client;Yeah, yeah, I have to laugh, I mean, even comedians say, you know, uh, most of-- What I've heard about comedians is that they are really not always that happy and they use that in a comical way to, you know, deal with life, so, yeah. [laughs] I kind of, maybe I should go into that. [laughs] Like this girl—;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;therapist;Your new career.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;client;Yeah, like this girl Ruth that I know she's-she's, uh, got a serious job and she kind of does that on the side. [laughs];;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;therapist;So, um, what are the uh, uh, what would be the benefits to you right now to having him out of the house?;question;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;client;Mm. Let's see. Well, you know, I'm really not sure, I kind of, you know. Um, I'm having a hard time with that. Um.;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;therapist;Tell me a bit more about that.;question;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;client;Mm, well, I have to really think about it because-;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;therapist;Some guilt?;question;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;client;Yeah, yeah. Maybe some guilt and I, um, uh, I just, you know, [sighs] I go back and forth a little bit, you know.;;sustain94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;therapist;Cause you wanna do the right thing because you're- because you're a good person and that's a- that's a really important value to you is that you- is that you help people out.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;client;Yeah, I-I- yeah. I mean I- thank you. I-I-I appreciate you saying that I'm a good person. Like I feel I am. Um—;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;therapist;But you've done your duty. Duty is done.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;client;Yeah. Oops, it's just hard to- it's just hard to, um, er, yeah. I- my j- my job is done and I have to start to realize that I have to be a little bit more assertive, I think, and a little bit more, um, sure of myself.;;change94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;therapist;And so, what have you done in order to start getting them to Hit The Road, Jack?;question;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;client;Well, um, I've had co-conversations about with him and sometimes not-not so pleasant, but I'm-I'm just making, you know, 'cause I happen to sometimes just like hold things in. And then finally I- at-at one point I was really, you know, very logical about it. And then the other day I kind of got not so logical about it.;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;therapist;Okay.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;client;[laughs];;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;therapist;So, uh, you were telling me earlier though that you've talked to some other people and he has some options about some other places to go to.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;client;Yeah. That's the good thing that he does. And I mentioned them. I-I-I discussed that with him.;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;client;And that gives me a relie- a sense of relief. Like I'm not just, you know, saying yeah. You know, go find your own place or, you know, I mean, there are places where he has a safety net to go to and that-that is something that I think I feel better about and that it makes it easier to discuss and giving them options that he can-- Yeah, yeah, exactly.;;change94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;therapist;So, you might have to literally like pack his bags and help them get to those places, um.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;41;client;Been there, done that. [laughs];;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;42;therapist;Okay. Are you-- This is something you've done before.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;43;client;Yeah.;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;44;therapist;So whe-when-when are you gonna do it?;question;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;45;client;Well, um, I told him within a couple of days is, you know. I think, um, I-I- cause I have future plans, um, and some things that are up in the air with me as far as where I'm going to be living in. I've had this place for seven years, but I'm not sure, you know. Every day is a new- a new, uh, winding road that we go down, you know?;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;46;therapist;Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;47;client;Um.;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;48;therapist;And it's kind of scary.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;49;client;Oh, God, yeah, yeah. But, you know, and it's scary to have an extra, a huge extra trunk that you have to carry with you [chuckles].;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;50;therapist;And he's that extra trunk.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;51;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;52;therapist;Okay.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;53;client;But I-I mean and it's not that I don't care about him, I do. But you know, it's just like, we're both- we're all adults here, come on.;;change94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;54;therapist;Okay. All right. So, it sounds like you-you've actually worked this out until be out within a couple of days.;reflection;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;55;client;Um, that's the goal, you know.;;change94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;56;therapist;Okay.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;57;client;And I don't know what his plans are, but those are my plans.;;change94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;58;therapist;Okay. Well, I have a funny feeling your plans will prevail. [laughter];other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;59;client;I like your way of thinking, girl. I-I'll tell him that. [laughs].;;neutral94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;60;therapist;Well, thanks for-for talking and playing with our little things here.;other;94;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;61;client;Thank you;;neutral95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;Right. Hi, Ruth, thank you for coming today. How are you?;question;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;Um, okay. Just, I don't even know why I'm doing this anymore. I'm-I'm just so stupid. I'm such an idiot. I didn't know what the point of-of this is. I just- I just keep doing the same thing over and over, even though I know it can kill me. I just, I don't have any more willpower, ma'am. Yeah, [foreign language].;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;Well, Ruth, it sounds like you're very frustrated first of all. And you're saying that you're just tired. You've lost all your willpower.;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;Mm-hmm.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;You don't want to continue.;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;No, it just seems that cutting myself is the only way out. And I just get suicidal thoughts and [foreign language], I'm just very, very like depressed and what's going on at home.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;So you feel really, really like you've had it up to here.;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;Yeah.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;Yeah. You're-you're tired. You're stressed. You feel so sad to the point that you're hurting yourself physically so that you can feel something other than what you're feeling right now.;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;Yes. Sometimes a pain in-in the body. It's, uh, to [unintelligible 00:01:27] handle and-and the pain inside of me.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;So you were in a lot of pain?;question;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;client;Yes. I am.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;therapist;I'm sorry about that. It must be very, very frustrating to feel all that pain and not be able to do anything about it. And it seems like the only thing that you can do right now is to cry.;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;client;Yeah, yeah, suicide.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;therapist;It's okay, Ruth. I understand. Pain inside.;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;client;[foreign language];;neutral95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;therapist;So your mom doesn't understand you and you don't have a dad, that's around?;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;client;Yeah, 'cause she's a single mom and she struggles a lot. I wanna help her, but I can't help her. So it just makes me sad. I feel like if I don't live anymore, she'll be okay. And she wouldn't have to worry about me or pay my stuff.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;therapist;So you feel like your hands are tied, you feel like you're a burden to mom. She's a single parent. She works a lot. You have all of these problems in your life. And it sounds to me like you feel like you're just adding more problems to her.;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;client;Yeah.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;therapist;And if you're not alive, that's gonna solve the issue for her. She'll do better.;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;client;I-I think so?;;neutral95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;therapist;How is she gonna be better off without you?;question;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;client;Because it won't be a burden to her.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;therapist;And how are you a burden now?;question;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;client;Because she has to pay for my food and my uniforms, um, to have a roof over our heads.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;therapist;And how do you help her now?;question;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;client;Um, I try to be a good kid. I tried to go to school. I may not have the best grades, but I'm not failing any classes.;;change95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;therapist;Okay. So then even by you coming here today, Ruth, and talking to me and opening up and telling me that you don't feel like you want to continue moving in and telling me and-and confiding in me that, you know, you hurt yourself and all this pain that you feel, that is you trying to help yourself out in one way or another. And that shows that you care. And even more, it shows that you care about your mom and that, in the end, it doesn't sound like you wanna leave her alone because you're still worried about ot-you're still worried about all the burdens on her that you're even thinking of removing yourselves to make her life easier. That shows me that you care about her so, so much, but right now the immediate solution that you have in your mind, it seems like it's-it's-;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;client;That's the right one.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;therapist;-How could it be the right one? Ending your life hurting yourself when it's just you and your mom. And you just said, she's a single parent. She doesn't have a husband, you don't have a dad. It's just the two of you. So how could it be the right choice? B;question;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;client;Um, I don't know. I don't know. It's just, um, I'm not sure I can.;;sustain95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;therapist;You're not sure. So you have a lot of on your mind right now. You just opened up to me. You told me that you've been cutting, that you've also been thinking about hurting yourself, killing yourself, not being here. Short-term, the cutting is helping you. You feel like a burden to mom, that stresses you out. That makes you sad. You see how much she struggles, but also on the same hand, we see how much you've been trying and how much you've been trying to help out by trying to go to school. We know your attendance is good. You go most of the time, you know, you're trying to keep up your grades.You have a C average, even having A in math, which we know was the lowest grade you had all semester. So all of those things shows how much effort you've put in and we see that effort. So you've been doing what you can and it's normal to feel like sometimes it's not enough. But that's-that's what we're here for so that you can tell us those things and we can help you.;reflection;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;client;Thank you, ma'am, I feel better.;;change95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;therapist;Oh, thank you, Ruth. Thank you for coming today.;other;95;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;client;Okay.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Thank you for coming in today, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe just wanna start off with just sharing a little bit about you and what brought you in today?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I guess, well, my doctor referred me to see you. Um, I guess he has some concerns about, um, my- my pregnancy and- and my baby. So, um, yeah, well, I'm doing what I'm told.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;So you're following through on meeting with me today and you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you tell me a little bit about that?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Uh, yeah, he is concerned about my alcohol intake.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay. And I'm wondering if you have any concerns about that.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Uh, no.;;sustain96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;No. Okay. So that's- that's not been an issue for you. Uh, it is an issue for him and not for you at this point.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. So what about maybe sharing a little bit about your alcohol intake and maybe a little bit about what your- what your life's like a little bit for me today?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, okay. Uh, well, I guess I drink like a glass of wine at supper every night, and just to, you know, relax a little with my friends if I go out. So wine has always been a kind of a family tradition with supper. So-;;sustain96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Okay.;other;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Yeah.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;So it was kind of been a part of your culture a little bit, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe takes the edge off a little bit and-;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Yeah, and I, you know, I-I have friends who have drank during pregnancy, and-and I see articles on Facebook and-and, you know, things that show that there isn't really a clear link between, you know, abnormalities or, uh, yeah, I just- I just think it's kind of an old wives' tale. So, you know, I'm independent and I'm gonna- I'm gonna do what I want, it's my body.;;sustain96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Okay. So you don't feel very comfortable with somebody telling you what you should be consuming, what kind of alcohol, and how much alcohol you should be consuming. And, um, it sounds like you've been getting some mixed messages, your doctor's saying there's no safe amount of alcohol you can drink, and asked you to come and see me. And then also, you've been checking- sounds like you've been checking things out a little bit.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Yeah. You know, I've looked it up to see, you know, kinda what I can say back, you know, to support my argument.;;sustain96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Okay.;other;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah, which is that, um, I'm going to do what I- do what I wanna do and what I know, right? So it's- yeah. I don't know, but, um, I'm here anyway. So-;;sustain96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;So you know yourself best and you wanna be sort of the boss of your body and you don't want somebody else telling you what- what's okay and what's not okay. And it seems like you're not maybe too concerned right now about your substance use.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Nope. I never have been.;;sustain96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;"Okay. And I'm wondering if that concern is coming from, ""It's been okay. I've got these messages from friends.""";reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yep.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;"""Um, media has said it's okay to drink during alcohol. And so that concern, um, just sort of, I don't have it and, and maybe the doctor might be wrong.""";reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Mm-hmm. I think so.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;You're not sure if he's sort of playing things up a little bit there?;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Yeah. I mean, you know-;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;It might be a bit extreme to-;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;-to quit drinking. Um, I'm just wondering, have you, um, would you be open maybe to just kind of taking a look at what Canada's guidelines say about drinking? Um, is that something you'd be open to?;therapist_input;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Like right now?;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Yeah.;other;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Uh-;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;What if- uh, can I show you a brochure about that?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Uh, yeah, I guess.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Yeah?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Sure.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Well, if we take a look at the low-risk-alcohol drinking guidelines, what it says is for women, um, the safe limits are 10 drinks a week for women and 2 drinks a day. And that's if a woman isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy. So really zero alcohol is, um, the woman should not be drinking any at all. And I'm just wondering what-what are your thoughts on that?;therapist_input;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Well, you know, I've-I've heard these kinds of things before, but I just- I don't see the evidence. I don't see the risk, you know, I don't, you know, if someone can like prove to me, or show a direct link or something like that.;;sustain96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;So when you see it here in kind of black and white, you're not sure if this is, uh, you know, enough-;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;It's the same thing.;;sustain96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;to con- sort of convince you that-that it might be dangerous to be drinking through alcohol?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Yeah. It's just a fancy little brochure saying what I've already known, I've already heard.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;So you feel like, um, what the doctor's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's just kind of blowing things up out of proportion a little bit.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;And it sounds like you-you've got some solid information already that alcohol, you know, has been safe to-to have during pregnancy. Tell me about that information that you've-you've explored.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;Um, well, I've looked up, um, different articles. Um, and I- as I said, I personally know people who haven't had any problems. Um, so that's about the extent.;;sustain96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Mm-hmm. You mentioned you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. So, um, those articles, is that something recent? Um, you can tell me about that.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Like, uh, I don't like- have like a bibliography or anything.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;So I can't really- I don't really know when those were published. It's just stuff I've found, supporting the way that I look at it.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;So you felt like, um, the information that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the information that your doctor shared or spoke to you about, and then this brochure kind of feels like that's challenging sort of your values.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Yeah. Well, it's like all this brochure is saying is that, um, the same again, the same thing that I've heard, that the limits and that there is no safe amount of drink during pregnancy, but it's like, why not?;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;"You know, it's kind of like the ""why"" that it's like-";;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;I never get that information.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;Wha-what's the big deal if you're drinking and—;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;Yeah, like what kind of issues would that cause if any?;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Maybe we can kind of put that on the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to it and sort of look at, you know, what is- what does the guidelines have to say about why. And, um, and-and I'm wondering if we can kind of just have a look for a moment at, um, your pregnancy, and is this something that you were- you were hoping to have a baby?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Yeah.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;That was something that you'd been planning?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Yep.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Okay. And I'm wondering as far as, um, bringing the baby into the world and, you know, your future as a parent, ho-how important is it to have a healthy baby to you?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Um, well, it's-it's really important to me. That's a big priority of mine is to have a healthy baby and bring him or her up well and-and, you know, be a good parent.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;Mm. What does being a good parent look like? Tell me more about that.;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;65;client;Um, not-not like being there at home with them, not being absent, um, taking care of them, feeding them, um, changing their diaper, which I'm not excited about. Um, you know, kind of the- those basics.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;66;therapist;Hmm. Kind of like protecting your baby and-;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;67;client;Yeah.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;68;therapist;-guiding your baby and-;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;69;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;70;therapist;-you know, nurturing that baby is really important to you-;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;71;client;Yeah.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;72;therapist;and raising your baby well?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;73;client;Yeah, of course.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;74;therapist;That's something that- that really matters to you and, um, I'm-I'm hearing you say that, you know, protecting your baby is important to you and at the same time, um, kind of clashes with some of the information that's in the brochure.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;75;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;76;therapist;What do you make about that- what do you think about that?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;77;client;Um, well, I just don't know- I just don't know where-where these brochures get their information or-or anything from, like, where's the hard evidence essentially.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;78;therapist;You wanna see it in black and white.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;79;client;Yeah.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;80;therapist;You wanna know that it's the latest and the greatest kind of thing. Um, this is information that, uh, that I have been sharing with you earlier, this is the latest information evidence-based, um, on the latest research since 2011 and, um, a lot of research has gone into what is-what is okay for a mom to consume, like, alcohol. There's the-the evidence that we have, um, but in the end, you choose what's best for you and what's best for your baby. What are your- what are your thoughts on that?;therapist_input;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;81;client;Um, well, it surprises me that that's based on research from out of 2011, um, and I must have missed that. I guess, you know, if it is, um, you know, I do wanna do what's best for my baby and for myself. And if I have to quit drinking, um, I guess ultimately I have to-I make that decision, um, but, um, that's a lot of, uh, information to take in today.;;change96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;82;therapist;Mm-hmm, kind of feels like, you know, you were making some really good decisions about your baby. You've done research and you wanna be able to bring your baby up well and take care of your baby. And I-I can see that that's really important to you. I hear you saying that and it kind of feels like this information isn't kind of what you were expecting to hear.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;83;client;Nope.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;84;therapist;What would you feel like would be helpful as far as next steps, like when you think about maybe moving away from drinking alcohol throughout the rest of your pregnancy?;question;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;85;client;Um, well, first things first, if I could take a brochure home maybe, um, you know, show it to my partner and-and-and get-get their support, um, I think that's really gonna help me, and kind of changing our-our habits, or, you know, putting the alcohol away, out of sight. Um, I think that's probably the best thing I can do, like, today when I get home.;;change96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;86;therapist;Mm-hmm, that's some really significant steps you're talking about. You're talking about putting the alcohol away, that's huge. That's-that's really big steps.;reflection;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;87;client;Yeah.;;neutral96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;88;therapist;I really want to thank you for, you know, exploring this with me today, and I'm wondering if we can kind of continue this conversation again, and talk about those steps, and how it goes with talking to your partner about giving up drinking and, um, the- giving you a chance to do some more research and, you know, maybe looking through these brochures and kind of just coming back and sharing a little bit more about, you know, what you thought about the information and what feels right for you. Is that something you'd be open to?;therapist_input;96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;89;client;Yeah, I think that- I think that would be a good idea, and maybe you could help me, yeah, with, like, ways to approach it because I think that my partner kind of has the same view that I- that I had. So-;;change96;high;reducing alcohol consumption;90;therapist;We definitely can cover that again on our next meeting.

I wonder if I could raise the subject of your weight.;question;97;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;What?;;neutral97;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;I wondered if we could spend just a couple of minutes talking about your weight.;question;97;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;You are joking, aren't you? I mean, look, I've made time in my day to come here.;;sustain97;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Yeah.;other;97;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;I'm kept in your waiting room-;;neutral97;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;Yeah.;other;97;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;-for 45 minutes.;;neutral97;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Yeah.;other;97;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;It's not acceptable.;;neutral97;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;Yeah.;other;97;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;You know?;;neutral97;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;Yeah.;other;97;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;If I make an appointment with a client for 10:00-;;neutral97;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Yeah.;other;97;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;-I expect them to start at 10:00, not 10:45.;;neutral97;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;Right, and you-- so you're busy enough, and—;reflection;97;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;Yeah, I've got other things to do.

So, if I could just ask you a couple of questions-;other;98;high;compliance with rules;5;client;Sure.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;6;therapist;-surrounding that, will that be okay?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;7;client;Absolutely. Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;8;therapist;-um, we-we're-- You're here probably because of your speeding ticket. That's what I gathered.;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;9;client;Yeah. I got a DUI, and I was speeding, uh, during the DUI, obviously.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;10;therapist;Oh. Oh, okay.

I just wanted to make sure, um, uh, and, um, if the last time you-you drank was--;question;98;high;compliance with rules;13;client;The night of the-the DUI is the last time I drank.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;14;therapist;Uh-huh, yeah.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;15;client;And then, you know, um, I guess I'm here 'cause my lawyer wants me to go through an assessment-;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;16;therapist;Sure.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;17;client;-uh, with you, and, um, I'm really not sure what it means or anything like that, but, uh, he said I'm supposed to come here and, uh, just tell the truth, is what he told me.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;18;therapist;Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate that.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;20;therapist;Um, and also, if there's any-any-any information that you need from me, please, um, feel free to ask. Um, that the reason that he asked you to come in was because of the blood alcohol level was 2.8.;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;21;client;Okay.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;22;therapist;So, um, that was legally beyond the limit that you should be driving.;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;23;client;Is it bad, or is it high or?;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;24;therapist;Well, it's-it's high, uh, you know, they--;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;25;client;Okay.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;26;therapist;For driving.;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;27;client;Okay;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;28;therapist;And so, um, the officer at the- at the scene, um, when you blew the 2.8, he-he did-- he-- There was a- there was a problem.;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;29;client;Yeah. He was, well, freaking out. He was--;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;30;therapist;Was he freaking out? Yeah-yeah.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;31;client;I think he was getting a little over the top a little bit, but, you know, again, whatever.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;32;therapist;Right-right. So, um, I'll just ask you a couple of questions, um, if you don't mind about-about your drinking. And-and your-- So, um, you said the couple was two weeks ago was the last time you drank?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;33;client;Yes.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;34;therapist;Yeah. Okay. And, um, that night, what was it that you-you drank and, how much?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;35;client;Uh, my friend was having a, um- a get together as it was birthday party in, uh, downtown, and, uh, you know, it's not like it's a normal thing, but, uh, I did drink too much that night. You know, I just, uh-- And I used poor judgment. I shouldn't have driven that night.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;36;therapist;Right. Yeah. Um, I was-- Maybe, you could tell me about how much you drank.;question;98;high;compliance with rules;37;client;Um, I don't really remember. I know, uh, I dunno, I probably had five or six drinks, I would think, something like that.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;38;therapist;Mm-hmm. Five, six drinks, like?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;39;client;Um, yeah, they were a little bigger than that. I don't really-- I wasn't really counting, so, I don't really know.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;40;therapist;Oh, okay. So, I guests maybe five or six.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;41;client;Five or six, something like that. Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;42;therapist;Um, yeah. And-and, w-what were the drinks, were?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;43;client;Um, absolute vodka-;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;44;therapist;Hmm.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;45;client;and seven off. Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;46;therapist;Oh, okay. So, um, you said that it was pretty much just five or six. Do you-- How often do you use that? And you said it's not a-;question;98;high;compliance with rules;47;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;48;therapist;not a normal occasion for you to drink that much?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;49;client;Normally I drink one or two, and that's kind of it, you know, this one I did, uh- you know, I did feel a little drunk when I was- you know, when I was drinking, I just, uh, used poor judgment. I really shouldn't have drove.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;50;therapist;Right. Yeah. Um, so, you usually don't drink that much. Um, on an average, maybe a week, how much would you say you drink? Just--;question;98;high;compliance with rules;51;client;Um, sometimes I drink, um, you know, maybe one or two, and then I- and then I won't drink for a while, you know. So, it's not really a-- There's not really a pattern-;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;52;therapist;Uh-huh;other;98;high;compliance with rules;53;client;-you know, it's not really like a uh- it's not a habit, you know,;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;54;therapist;Right.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;55;client;I-I don't know if I would consider myself alcoholic. You know, I just, uh, um, you know, again, it was poor judgment.;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;56;therapist;Right. So, it doesn't get in the way of your-;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;57;client;Oh, no.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;58;therapist;every day.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;59;client;Absolutely not. Mm-mm.;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;60;therapist;Right. Oh, that's good.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;61;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;62;therapist;So, um, looking back, Mike, uh, when was it that you started thinking that when you did use alcohol, um, most in your life?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;63;client;Um, there was really not a time that I, uh-- I don't know. I-I don't understand the question really. I mean, it-- There really wasn't-- I don't really drink on a normal basis, so, I don't know-- [crosstalk];;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;64;therapist;So, that is- that is a complete, uh-- A question that is even applicable?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;65;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;66;therapist;Okay.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;67;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;68;therapist;That's fine.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;69;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;70;therapist;That's fine. Okay. Um, so, what about the, uh- the first DUI, could you tell me a little bit about that? This was your second one?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;71;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;72;therapist;And so, that's sort of why I was asking about it earlier in your life if that was a--;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;73;client;It seems like every time that I, uh, do drink more than a couple of drinks, I tend to get in trouble. And, the two times that I did, I got in trouble both times. [crosstalk];;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;74;therapist;It was those two times. Yeah.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;75;client;Yeah, pretty much. I mean, it's-- It sounds strange, I know, but, uh--;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;76;therapist;It sounds like bad luck.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;77;client;Yeah. Actually, that-that's followed me around pretty much my whole life, the bad luck thing.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;78;therapist;Yeah.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;79;client;But the-the-the-the-the alcohol hasn't really at all.;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;80;therapist;Oh, okay.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;81;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;82;therapist;But just that bad luck?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;83;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;84;therapist;Yeah. Is there alcohol with the- with-- Goes hand in hand with the bad luck or just--;question;98;high;compliance with rules;85;client;Sure seems like it. Yeah. It sure seems like that.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;86;therapist;Yeah. Oh, okay. So-so, what about that? The-- Is there other incidences that you could think of that seems, uh, um, alcohol was there, and then your luck just sorta took a-a turn, or it was just those two times?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;87;client;Um, you know, I don't really, um-- I-I don't really, uh, get into a situation where I-I-I drink too much. Um, you know, again, I-I realize it's my second DUI, but,, um, uh-uh, it isn't something that, um, is like a normal everyday process for me.;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;88;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;89;client;Um, you know, normally when I drink, I drink one or two drinks and then I stop. Um, so, it's not like it's, um-- You know, it's not like it's something that has become a problem in my life, you know.;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;90;therapist;Oh, good. Oh, good. And-and so, where do you usually, um, have your drinks? Is it at home or, uh, out-out for, uh- after work, social drinking?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;91;client;Um, it's normally social.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;92;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;93;client;Yeah. It's normally social. It would be, you know, maybe in events or something like that is normally when I would, um, maybe drink more than one or two.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;94;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;95;client;I guess I should probably just call a taxi cab or something, you know. That way, I wouldn't have this problem.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;96;therapist;Would that help?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;97;client;Um, probably, I think that would help. I think that would be something that I should, uh- I should work on.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;98;therapist;So, it sounds like you've already been thinking about, uh, ways to-to get around safely.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;99;client;Yeah. Yeah, or I can just stay home probably too. If I was gonna drink, I could probably stay home, then I wouldn't get in trouble either.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;100;therapist;You have been giving this a lot of thought.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;101;client;Yeah, a little bit.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;102;therapist;Yeah, good.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;103;client;Yeah, obviously, because I just don't-- You know, I don't like getting in trouble, and I don't, uh--;;change98;high;compliance with rules;104;therapist;Trouble's not fun.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;105;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;106;therapist;No.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;107;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;108;therapist;Yeah. So, tell-tell me a little bit more about, um, when you fi-- If you'd find yourself, and then that-that thought comes about maybe doing something other than getting in the- in the car, does that come and go, or-or is it something that you think you-- Next time you might do?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;109;client;Um, oh, I'll never get in the car when I'm drinking again. That-- Yeah. I-I would never do that again.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;110;therapist;This, it-- What-what-what was different?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;111;client;Uh, I don't want to lose my license, you know.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;112;therapist;Hmm.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;113;client;I don't, uh, you know, I don't wanna lose my license.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;114;therapist;Wow. You-you need your license-;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;115;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;116;therapist;to get around. you need your license for work.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;117;client;Well, and then I-I sell cars for a living too, so--;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;118;therapist;Oh.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;119;client;-um, you know, that would be, um-- You know, I don't wanna lose my job either. You know, I think those would kind of be connected together.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;120;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;121;client;And, you know, I-- You're not gonna call my work or anything for this, are you?;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;122;therapist;No.;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;123;client;Oh, okay.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;124;therapist;No, no. That's--;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;125;client;All right.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;126;therapist;That would be entirely up to you, um, to-to have that.;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;127;client;Okay. I just didn't know how that worked.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;128;therapist;Oh, no.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;129;client;Because I think if they found out, I might, you know, be in jeopardy with my job. So--;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;130;therapist;Well, you're here. And-and-and I have you give, uh-uh, credit for that. It took a lot to come in today and, um, when, um- when somebody is actually talking safety for themselves, which I-I hear you saying, um, calling a taxi or-or staying home.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;131;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;132;therapist;So, what does staying home look like for you? Is that something that-- You know, you-you talked about drinking at an event. Would staying home be--;question;98;high;compliance with rules;133;client;Well, you know, the Super Bowl is coming up, and that might be an opportunity where, you know, I might-- I could see myself maybe drinking that day, you know.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;134;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;135;client;So, maybe I would just, uh-- I think I'll just have people come over to my house instead of going somewhere else, you know.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;136;therapist;That would work for you?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;137;client;Yeah, I think so, and probably a smarter thing to do. I don't wanna go through this again, you know.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;138;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;139;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;140;therapist;Uh, so, uh, would people come and drink at your house, and then they would be fine with that?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;141;client;I think so.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;142;therapist;Yeah.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;143;client;Sure.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;144;therapist;Yeah.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;145;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;146;therapist;So, an event at your house.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;147;client;There you go.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;148;therapist;Yeah, good. That sounds good. Mike, has there even been, if any, um, a time in your life when you've thought about, um, not drinking at all?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;149;client;For my first DUI, I did, uh-- I didn't drink at all for about six months. And, um, I-I-I just didn't think that, um, I really had a problem with it, so, you know, I-I did start drinking again. But, you know, again, it wasn't uh-- You know, it was a little different last time, because I was drinking a little more last time than, you know, now. I don't really drink as-as much as I used to drink, you know, um, and, you know, after you know, I quit for six months, so I kind of knew that I didn't really have a problem.;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;150;therapist;Right. Six months. That's a long time.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;151;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;152;therapist;What were those six months like for you?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;153;client;Um, I know it was kind of strange. My friends didn't really hang out with me too much. Um--;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;154;therapist;Friends?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;155;client;Yeah. You know, I, uh.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;156;therapist;Whi-which? If you don't mind me asking, which friends were those?

I don't really know. I mean, it seemed, uh--;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;162;therapist;Did you ask them?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;163;client;Um, no. I really couldn't because my girlfriend really wouldn't let me hang with them. You know? I mean, it was, uh-- She said that if I, you know, kept hanging out with them guys, that she wasn't gonna be with me anymore. And I just thought that it was better for me to, you know, calm down for a little bit and, uh, maybe things would get better with us, you know.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;164;therapist;And your girlfriend's important to you-;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;165;client;Sure.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;166;therapist;and that relationship was important to you.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;167;client;Well, it was until she left, you know.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;168;therapist;At the time it was important, yeah.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;169;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;170;therapist;Is it-- Why'd she leave?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;171;client;Uh, she left when I started drinking again.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;172;therapist;Oh, after the six months.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;173;client;After the six months, she, uh-- You know, it's kinda, I dunno, she just said that it wasn't gonna work out, and, uh, she decided not to continue with the relationship.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;174;therapist;Oh, okay. So-so, um, you started drinking again, and then she left?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;175;client;Uh, it was about the same time. I really don't know which came first. It was about the same time. Uh, we were getting in a lot of arguments. I just didn't quite feel myself. You know, I-I-I wasn't-- My friends weren't around. I, uh-- You know, I missed going out with them.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;176;therapist;You felt isolated?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;177;client;Yeah. It was kind of weird 'cause I felt like she was trying to control me, and, uh- and uh, you know, I, uh-- And she was telling me what to do all the time, and I just, uh, didn't feel right about the whole situation. So, it was pretty much, we both decided, you know, that it just wasn't the right thing to do, so.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;178;therapist;And, so you're-you're an independent guy-;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;179;client;Sure.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;180;therapist;-and, no one's going to tell you what to do.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;181;client;Well, I guess.

Yeah. It's all right.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;220;therapist;Um, so, that it was sort of after that that the girlfriend-- Your girlfriend, I don't know, well, her name.

You felt like she was the only person that, um, you had in your life, you needed your friends and--;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;229;client;Um, I think she just wanted to control me and I was tired of being controlled.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;230;therapist;No one likes to be controlled, uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, and, in what ways, well, did you feel that, um, uh, at any time, did you feel controlled by your friends. You said they-they made you drink those shots. That-that sounded like maybe you felt a little controlled? But-- [crosstalk];question;98;high;compliance with rules;231;client;No, I was-- They just-- No, they weren't- they weren't really controlling me. They just-- They shouldn't have given me the last couple shots, 'cause you, they-they knew I was pretty, you know, uh, messed up before that. So-;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;232;therapist;Yeah.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;233;client;-you know, that when they- when they-- You know, when they gave me the last, you know, couple shots, that kind of put me over the edge.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;234;therapist;Right, they weren't looking out for your best interest at that point.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;235;client;Pretty much, pretty much.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;236;therapist;And then sent you out in your car.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;237;client;Yeah. I mean I guess it was my decision to take the, uh- you know, the other shots, but I-I just-- I don't know. I really don't really remember too much.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;238;therapist;It's a hindsight again.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;239;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;240;therapist;Yeah.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;241;client;Yeah. You can blame hindsight a little bit. I mean, that works for me. [laughter];;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;242;therapist;Hindsight? Oh, yeah, they'll-- it'll take the- it'll take the blame. Um, so, you still-- Do you still, uh, you know, you started drinking again, and then, um, the second DUI, what-- Is it the same circle of social-social circle, same friends?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;243;client;Yeah. [crosstalk];;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;244;therapist;Same type of situation. [crosstalk];reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;245;client;I mean, they've been my friends since, you know, uh, since high school.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;246;therapist;So, they're important to you?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;247;client;Yeah, absolutely.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;248;therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah. And-and sometimes, um, people have friends who are friends, but then there's friends who would stay on in our lives and are constant. So, these would be your constant core--;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;249;client;Sure, absolutely.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;250;therapist;Yeah, okay.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;251;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;252;therapist;Have you ever had, um, uh, interest outside, um, the social drinking, the friends, um, like, what do you do when you're not with them?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;253;client;Uh, well, like I'll do stuff around the house, you know, uh, cut the grass and stop, do yard work, other than that, um, I don't know.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;254;therapist;Yeah. And any other relationship, if you don't mind me asking-- [crosstalk];question;98;high;compliance with rules;255;client;Uh, no, I'm single now, so, you know, I don't really, uh-- [crosstalk];;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;256;therapist;How's that going?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;257;client;It's all right, you know, I date a little bit but, uh, you know, I just don't wanna get serious right now.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;258;therapist;Oh what-- So, what does serious look like? Um--;question;98;high;compliance with rules;259;client;Um, I just don't want to date someone in a regular basis. I don't really feel like I want to be in a committed relationship.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;260;therapist;Yeah. That's all right, yeah. That's good. It sounds like you know yourself pretty well.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;261;client;Sure, absolutely.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;262;therapist;Okay. Right. So, um, now that we-we are looking at, um, your second DUI and, um-- Well, so now, Mike, if you don't mind me asking, what would you do differently, um-um, from here on now?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;263;client;Well, I think I would like really think about--;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;264;therapist;Since the co- the court sent you and we have to sort of explore what would happen if you went out and did this again.;therapist_input;98;high;compliance with rules;265;client;Yeah. Well, I mean I-I, uh- I, uh- I wouldn't drink as much, and if I- if I did, I would call, uh, a taxi or, um, you know, get some kind of a ride home, I think, 'cause, uh, you know, I just, uh-- I-I just don't wanna get in trouble, you know.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;266;therapist;Yeah. Is there somebody that you could call?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;267;client;Uh, I don't really think about that. I guess I would have to think about that, because if I was gonna go out and drink, I would have to think about that. Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;268;therapist;Right.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;269;client;I guess I could call it taxi cab or something, I don't know.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;270;therapist;They'll come.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;271;client;Yeah. I think that will be something.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;272;therapist;Yeah. They'll come. As long as you got the money, they'll come and get you. Yeah.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;273;client;Yeah. I think maybe if I take some money, I'll put it like in my wallet-;;change98;high;compliance with rules;274;therapist;Yeah.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;275;client;-and I'll like put it in there for emergency, and that way, I'll have money. In case I get drunk, I can just call a cab, and I'll use that money to get home.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;276;therapist;Oh, so, when you use your-your bar money, it would be somewhere else?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;277;client;What's that?;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;278;therapist;Your bar money would be somewhere else, not in your wallet?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;279;client;Probably in my front pocket, I guess.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;280;therapist;There you go. Okay, yeah. So, that, y-yeah.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;281;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;282;therapist;That makes- that makes a lot of sense. So then you'd have your money tucked away someplace different.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;283;client;Yeah. Well, if I put, uh- if I put it away, then I wouldn't spend it though, you know, [unintelligible 00:18:48] have it.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;284;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;285;client;There-there would be a plan that I would have to-;;change98;high;compliance with rules;286;therapist;Sounds like a good plan.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;287;client;to get home. Yeah.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;288;therapist;Yeah. So, uh, how often do you think you'll be needing that plan in the--;question;98;high;compliance with rules;289;client;It'd probably be my wallet for a while, I would think, 'cause I-- Like I said, I don't really think I have a problem with, uh- with the drinking, you know. I just-;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;290;therapist;Right.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;291;client;-think that, you know, it was an isolated incident.;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;292;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;293;client;And-and I, uh-- You know, I just, uh--;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;294;therapist;And then-- Yeah, and then also you said if you're going to have people, uh, you're gonna be drinking for the Super Bowl. Was is it Super Bowl?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;295;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;296;therapist;I'm sorry, I'm not a football fan but it's Super Bowl coming up, right?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;297;client;Yeah, well, you gotta have some people over at the Super Bowl, you know.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;298;therapist;So, you'd have them in and, um, I'm just curious about the folks who are leaving your house, would they-- Would-would you be concerned about them, there'll be a taxi. Sometimes designated drivers I--;question;98;high;compliance with rules;299;client;I don't really hang out with people that really drink a lot though. I mean, they're-they're not like-- I wouldn't call them drunks, so, I mean, they can, you know, they can handle their-- [crosstalk];;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;300;therapist;So, it would be up to them?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;301;client;Sure, I would think, yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;302;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;303;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;304;therapist;It sounds like you have-- You've thought about this, and you're-you're willing to put some things in place, the-the wallet, um, money in the wallet and-and for the taxi-;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;305;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;306;therapist;Have folks in to-to socialize for an event, and that you still have your-your social-- Your friends and your core group and-and, uh, just be careful. What was the six months of not drinking like for you? If you were to choose to not drink.;question;98;high;compliance with rules;307;client;You know, it was a- it was, uh- it was pretty good. I just didn't feel like I had my friends around, and-and it just-- It seemed kinda boring. I mean, I felt good physically and, uh, you know, I, uh- I was more on time to work, I was doing really good at work and so forth, um, but, you know, it just, um-- The hard part for me was I just, uh- I just didn't have any friends around. I just kinda-- I felt isolated. I just didn't- I just didn't feel comfortable, you know.;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;308;therapist;Six months is a- is a long time. There was, um-- Try to think back, were there- were there other people? Was it- was it just you?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;309;client;Well, my-my girl- my girlfriend and I were trying to work it out. But it just seemed like we were arguing all the time, you know. It just didn't seem like-- You know what I mean? Like the not-drinking part was good, but it just didn't seem like anything else had changed.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;310;therapist;All right.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;311;client;You know.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;312;therapist;So-so, if you were not to-- If you were to go with the plan of maybe not drinking, which you mentioned-;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;313;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;314;therapist;-um, uh, your girlfriend Mary is-is not a part of your life-;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;315;client;No-;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;316;therapist;right now.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;317;client;-and I really don't see that working out really well.;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;318;therapist;Would there be something else that would, um, sort of, uh, fill in that-- The-the friends area, do you think?;question;98;high;compliance with rules;319;client;Well, I don't know. I mean, it's a-- I mean, my friends drink though. So, it's kinda hard to- it's kinda hard to, you know, to be with them, and then-- When I'm not drinking, 'cause it's-- I just don't feel like I fit in, you know.;;sustain98;high;compliance with rules;320;therapist;But, yeah, I-I see what-what you're saying, for sure.

The choice is-is completely yours. And, um, it sounds like to me that there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to do this. You've given it a lot of thought, and you have some plans in place, and anyt;other;98;high;compliance with rules;386;client;Um, probably just not really drink as much. I mean, if I just didn't drink, I wouldn't have to really worry about that too much either.;;change98;high;compliance with rules;387;therapist;Then you wouldn't have to worry.;reflection;98;high;compliance with rules;388;client;Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;389;therapist;Yeah, because worry's no fun.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;390;client;Yeah. This is true. Yeah.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;391;therapist;All right. Well, thank you Mike. I appreciate this.;other;98;high;compliance with rules;392;client;Okay. Thank you.;;neutral98;high;compliance with rules;393;therapist;Thank you.;other;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Steve, before we're done with our visit today, I was wondering if you'd be willing to take a few minutes to talk about your drinking.;question;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay, like what?;;neutral99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Well, you filled out this survey for us today, which was great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to review a couple of things on here. I noticed that you said that you drink two to three times a week, drink three or four drinks at a time when you do drink, and weekly, um, have more drinks than that. So six or more drinks, it says on here.;reflection;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Does that sound realistic?;question;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah, uh, on the weekends?;;neutral99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay, okay. I just wanted to let you know, I'm a little bit concerned about your level of drinking. We know that excessive drinking can make problems worse or can actually cause health problems at times, and I was just wondering if you thought about the connection between your drinking and things like the anxiety and the insomnia that you came in with today?;therapist_input;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;No, I guess I haven't really thought much of it. Um, you know, I don't really think I drink that much in the first place-;;sustain99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;-so I have a hard time believing that it's causing my anxiety.;;sustain99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;In fact, on the nights when I don't drink, I-I have a harder time going to sleep.;;sustain99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Well, you're not alone, a lot of people think that drinking helps them sleep better, and in reality, drinking might make you fall asleep faster, but it has what's called this rebound effect, and this rebound effect means that you wake up, may, might wake up in the middle of the night or early in the morning and have a hard time falling back asleep.;therapist_input;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Well, I, yeah, I guess I do have abo-about 2:00 AM, I tend to wake up on the nights I drink too much.;;change99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, I just wanted to just show you this little chart here. For your age as a male, you're drinking more than those at a low-risk level. Um, the low-risk level for men under 65 is no more than 14 drinks a week and no more than four a day. And, in this case, a drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or an ounce and a half of distilled spirits. And you're right, you're not drinking as much as some people out there. The way you answered our questions here, you're actually falling in the high-risk category, the risky or hazardous category, category two.;therapist_input;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Jeez, no. I didn't think I was that bad.;;neutral99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;That's why it's helpful to look at this and give some perspective. On a scale of 1-10, what is your readiness to change, 1 being I don't want to change at all, and 10 is I really want to change?;question;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I don't know. I mean, this is all news to me. I've, I don't want to do anything to put myself at risk and I've always thought of myself as a pretty healthy guy. I guess I'd put myself right in the middle of the five.;;change99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Well, that's great. That's halfway there. What kept you from just giving it a one or two, something lower?;question;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Well, you know I'm training for the marathon, and that's why I'm coming in, is because I need to be able to get my sleep back on track, but I also don't think of myself as a hazardous drinker, and I'm certainly not an alcoholic. So, that's-that's why the middle-ground, five.;;change99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, that's a good place to start. So, I heard you say your health is important, and you're getting ready to run a marathon, so you wanna be able to do what you can to make that successful. And you also were a little bit surprised that you fell into this risky or hazardous category.;reflection;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yes.;;neutral99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Okay. So, based on all that information, what are you willing to think about doing to change right now?;question;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Well, I-I think the natural thing would be to cut back a little on my drinking.;;change99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, what would that look like for you?;question;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Mm, um, you know, I-I guess drinking no more than maybe three or four times a week, and-and on the weekends, which is when I would drink the most, cup back to no more than five or six beers.;;change99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?;therapist_input;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Um, doing the math, I guess no more than 18 drinks a week.;;change99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Okay. So that's an improvement. So you're headed in the right direction. I do wanna let you know that with 18 drinks a week, you're still falling above this low-level risk category, and that it would be my recommendation that at some point you would fall below into this 14 or less a week. But it's an improvement, and it's a great place to start, and I really commend you for your willingness to take a look at this and try to make some improvements.;therapist_input;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Thanks.;;neutral99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;So I'm hoping that in your appointment next month, we can touch base on this and see how it's going.;reflection;99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Sure.;;neutral99;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Okay. Good.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;There, um, what brings you in today?;question;100;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;I don't know. I'm just having a little bit of, uh, having a little bit of trouble dealing with, uh, my criminal history and, uh, you know, trying to stay on the right path, but, you know, um, it's just- it gets, you know, it gets kind of overwhelming, you know. Um, I really wanna be, you know, a good productive member of society, but at the same time, you know, I got this background that nobody will overlook, you know. So it kinda makes it like, well, what, you know, do I go back to what I know?I mean, you can only work for $5, $6, $7 an hour for so long, and it's really frustrating. It's causing, uh, some anger issues to resurface and some depression to resurface and, um, you know, and, um, I don't wanna fall back, you know.;;change100;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;It's really getting in the way of you becoming who you wanna be.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;Yes, it is.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;Yeah. So what-what-what about your criminal record is blocking you from getting where you wanna be?;question;100;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;I don't know what about it is, um—;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;There's a, uh, your record has a conviction?;question;100;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;Yeah. It has a felony conviction on it.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;Okay. Ah, there's-;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;And, uh—;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;the big trouble. Yeah.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;"Yeah, it is. And it's- I hadn't anticipated that it would have been-- You know, so at the time, it was just like, ""Okay, cool. I'm not going to jail.""";;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;You know, and, um, now, it's like, okay, so this is more like a life sentence than it was a four-year sentence that they were offering. You know, I mean, I think it would have been bad either way, but, um, I hadn't anticipated that this was gonna be this difficult, especially since I went back to school and, you know, uh, got a degree and actually want to do, you know, some, um, corporate level or, you know, professional type of work.;;sustain100;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. So when you, um, when you put in applications or anything like that, the felony con-conviction, whether you know it or not, seems to knock you out of the ballpark. You're not even considered as an applicant?;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;No, I'm not. Um, in situations where I don't know about it, I don't know about, I mean, if I'm not considered because of that, I probably-- Um, you know, that sucks too. Don't get me wrong. I mean, I-I don't- I don't get callbacks a lot because of that issue-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;- I'm sure. The ones that really count are-are-are, you know, are kind of just, you know, uh, making me so angry and, you know, kind of spilling over into the rest of my life or the ones that I get face face, especially after a really good interview. And,;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;"Black and white. It just stops right there. ""I'm sorry. I can't really do much for you. I-- You have to go,"" you know, and it's—";;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;So do you- do you, um, put out there about the felony conviction before you even go for the interview?;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;"No. I mean, there's different situations, you know. Sometimes they ask and, you know, I'll say something like, you know, ""We'll discuss at interview"". Uh, sometimes, there are situations where if I probably put that, I don't get a callback and those situations I don't know about. You know, but there are also times where I get an interview through, um, you know, uh, uh, some sort of connection or something, or like a buddy of mine or a family member will send me on an interview. You know, I don't have to fill it out- fill out an application for that. They just usually, you know, give you the interview. And at the end-";;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;Seems like it's a done deal.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;Yeah. It seems like it's a done deal. You just have to go through the motion of having the interview. And then-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;25;client;"-when I go through the interview and it goes well, and they're like, ""Okay, well, you know, I think we can do something"" and then, ""Here, sign this, sign that,"" and the other thing. And it's like, but we just had a great, you know, I mean, I qualify. Like";;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;26;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;27;client;And;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;28;therapist;So you didn't hurt anybody.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;29;client;No, I didn't.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;30;therapist;You didn't hurt anything, right?;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;31;client;It's really frustrating because-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;32;therapist;Yeah.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;33;client;-it's almost like I-I don't wanna give up, but it's like, I'm not given any other choice, you know?;;sustain100;high;reducing recidivism;34;therapist;Yeah, 'cause you're-you're, especially with going back to school and having done all that footwork and stuff. I mean, you really have something to offer somebody.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;35;client;I do, yeah.;;change100;high;reducing recidivism;36;therapist;Yeah. And, um, and at the time the big crisis was actually maybe prison and all the crisis around the arrest and-and, uh, you know, it's like you're a leper and the leper colony.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;37;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;38;therapist;Um, have there been any times when you've started the interview with that conversation so that you don't even have to go through the whole thing and then get rejected?;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;39;client;Not that I can think of, no.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;40;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;41;client;I think—;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;42;therapist;What do you think would happen if you did that?;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;43;client;Probably get booted out right away-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;45;client;-you know? Um—;;sustain100;high;reducing recidivism;46;therapist;Would that be, um, what would they be like versus getting through this great interview, knowing you're-you're good for the job and all that kind of stuff, and then they boot you out?;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;47;client;Well, it's-it's sucks either way. You know what I mean?;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;48;therapist;Mm-hmm. It's, uh, I mean the lesser of two evils is that what we're getting at-;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;49;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;50;client;-you know what I mean? If it's gonna make things more efficient like as if-if you're what you're trying to say is if that's something that I could do and then if they get past it, then now I know that there's an actual intention by the hiring people to hi;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;51;therapist;Right. If that's a deal-breaker and you both know it from the very beginning, I'm wondering if then really the interview is really something else. I mean, whether they get the job would truly be based on the interview and not-not your criminal record.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;52;client;Yeah, I think as far as maybe efficiency, you know, weeding out the things, not wasting my time, you know, but I had to tell you something, a lot of the people that don't care about that type of thing-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;53;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;54;client;-are not the sort of jobs that I really wanna be doing. You know what I mean? Um, I don't know, it's just really frustrating.;;sustain100;high;reducing recidivism;55;therapist;Not like you're working for the government or for a bank or, you know, the FBI where- those are not things you're applying for. They're jobs where you would wonder why a-a non-violent felony would even--;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;56;client;Be an issue.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;57;therapist;Right.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;58;client;Right, and then the other thing is anybody that I might tell that to-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;59;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;60;client;-that doesn't care-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;61;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;62;client;-are probably not jobs that, you know, are worth going to get the interview.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;63;therapist;Mm-hmm, you didn't go to college for that.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;64;client;Right.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;65;therapist;Mm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;66;client;Do you know what I mean? If I want to work at a moving company and I tell them off the bat, you know, from the gate, I tell them I have a felony conviction, just so you know before the interview and they don't really mind. I mean, that's great, you know, but at the same time, I don't- I'm not looking to be a mover or-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;67;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;68;client;-a burger flipper or something like that. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but I feel like I have a little bit more to offer-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;69;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;70;client;-you know, and, um, I don't know, it's a really, it's-it's like being caught between a rock and a hard place.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;71;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, what have you looked into about, um, you know, advocacy in that area or expungement or anything like that?;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;72;client;I have done, and my eyes have, you know, just become like mush after all the reading I've done on this situation.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;73;therapist;What did you find out?;question;100;high;reducing recidivism;74;client;I found out that I have the type of, um, felony that's expungable, I don't even have the type that's sealable. I have apparently the type that has to go on the governor's desk next to death row, you know, inmates or the candidates for, um, a gov- a governor's, uh, pardon. I-- That's what it all boils down to is that I have a class one felony-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;75;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;76;client;-that needs to be, if any, you know, options, the only option I have is for, um, governor's clemency and I can't figure out why because it's-it's, I mean, I just, I maybe there is a loophole somewhere, I don't know.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;77;therapist;I-I didn't know that. So I, you know, I know a little bit about it, um, and not, yeah. So that's-that's very interesting. Oh, what about advocacy groups?;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;78;client;I've looked into, um, a fe- um, I've looked into a few groups that are supposedly helping convicted felons get-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;79;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;80;client;work.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;81;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;82;client;Um, again, the-the only-- I mean, I think what I saw was a whole bunch of, you know, dead end jobs.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;83;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;84;client;And the other thing that I saw was that it was very politically charged. You know, I didn't think that, um, I was, uh, you know, allowed to kind of get an interview right away with one of those counselors that they offer. Um, I-- it just didn't seem like a type of place that was willing to help, you know. And-and, uh, I saw that there was a lot of, um, I wouldn't say racism but I would say a little bit of racial favor, I suppose. And, uh, I found it really hard to get in and to get an interview with a counselor to match me up with a job. Um, I think that those-those types of groups are cool if they work. I just haven't had any luck with, um- at working with- through that group.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;85;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;86;client;You know?;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;87;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;88;client;Um, you know, I don't know. I don't know if there's anything else out there.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;89;therapist;Mm-hmm. So you're-you're Middle Eastern. So you wonder-- I-I bet you've had experiences where you really have experienced some absolute racism and prejudice because of that.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;90;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;91;therapist;And then, um, you walk into these places and they might just be almost storefront-;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;92;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;93;therapist;type places. and the job market is terrible.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;94;client;Right. It's-it's, uh-- There is a lot stacked up against me.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;95;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;96;client;Let's just put it like that.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;97;therapist;Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;98;client;You know, uh, but that isn't—;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;99;therapist;What do you have going for you?;question;100;high;reducing recidivism;100;client;Well, that's what-- yeah. That's-- I mean, uh, I'm able to, um-- I'm able to carry a conversation.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;101;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;102;client;So at some point, I would imagine that maybe I strike up conversation with the right person-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;103;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;104;client;-that would probably want to hire me regardless of that sort of thing. Um, I think that at the this point in time, that it doesn't really matter what degree you have. I don't believe that it matters where you went to school. I think it's all about who you;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;105;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;106;client;-and getting jobs. And I think that, um, if I continue to, you know, go to school and, uh, you know, uh, get time from that felony, you know. So it's been seven years now and—;;change100;high;reducing recidivism;107;therapist;It's a long time.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;108;client;Yeah. And at some point, I probably don't even have to report it, you know, and I have that going for me. It's been seven years. I have the fact that I'm, you know, uh, good at, um, interaction with people, that's good.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;109;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;110;client;You know, um, I've been clean from that sort of lifestyle for that long so that's-that's-that's up for me, you know, that's-that's good. Um—;;change100;high;reducing recidivism;111;therapist;And you can- you can prove that and document that.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;112;client;Yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;113;therapist;Yeah. A lot of folks can't.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;114;client;They don't.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;115;therapist;Yeah. And you've been going to school. I mean, all-all your movement is in this really positive, highly motivated way. And, um- and I think your-your thoughts and ideas about the fact that one day a conversation will- you'll strike up with somebody and it will happen to be with somebody who works for a company that perhaps does not have a policy against hiring people with felony convictions.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;116;client;Yeah. Well, that's my hope.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;117;therapist;It's individual. Yeah.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;118;client;Yeah. That's my hope.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;119;therapist;It-it is individual.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;120;client;It is. It should be.

You know what I- you know, I'm kind of- I'm trying to look at the things that I can do.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;173;therapist;Well, that, you know, now that's a-a really different way of looking at it than how you were looking at what you can do versus what's getting in your way that you know you can't do.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;174;client;Right.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;175;therapist;So, um, what kinda- what-what are you starting? What's this business? If you-you don't have to tell me if you don't want, I know it's on the up and up, but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.;question;100;high;reducing recidivism;176;client;No, it's, um, uh, like a party planning event, you know, like a wedding planning, not like a wedding planner, but like—;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;177;therapist;You'd be so good at that.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;178;client;Like, you know, like corporate events when they have, you know, like an event, you know, they need-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;179;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;180;client;-you know, they need chauffeured transportation, limos, they need that type of thing. I, um, I'm involved in the planning of the transportation from airports, uh, hotel arrangements, um, uh, booking of, uh, you know, the rooms. It's just, I guess just an ;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;181;therapist;You-you would be the corporate company.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;182;client;Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm trying to get—;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;183;therapist;CEO.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;184;client;Yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;185;therapist;[laughter];other;100;high;reducing recidivism;186;client;I don't know about that, but, you know.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;187;therapist;So. Yeah, I- I've heard that-that in recession, uh, those are often the best opportunities for people to start doing business is to, um, see an area where you see a need go in and fill it.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;188;client;Yeah, I think that's my only, uh, uh, I know it's not my only-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;189;therapist;One.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;190;client;-but it's-it's- it's a good, It's a good opportunity to, um, kind of work for myself. I would love to just be able to work for myself, you know? Um.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;191;therapist;You're comfortable with that?;question;100;high;reducing recidivism;192;client;I am, I am comfortable with it and I do well. I do well at-at, you know, the few opportunities I've had to organize something like that. Um, it's okay. You know, um, at least I'm still going to school though, you know I'm going to be done with that.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;193;therapist;I know. That's fantastic. It is.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;194;client;I don't want to act out, you know, I mean, I'm, you know, I think I have-;;change100;high;reducing recidivism;195;therapist;Acting out would be what?;question;100;high;reducing recidivism;196;client;Well, you know, I dunno, um, going back to a lifestyle, you know, crime or, um, using, or you know, just destructive behavior-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;197;therapist;Okay. Gottcha.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;198;client;-and sort of destructive behavior. I don't wanna be destructive. I wanna be productive, you know.;;change100;high;reducing recidivism;199;therapist;Like you are now.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;200;client;Like I am now, but it's-it's starting to get-- Like I said, I mean, I wouldn't have come in here if things were just peachy keen, you know what I mean? It sucks. And I'm getting sick of, you know, rejection and it's like almost, it makes me think like, why am I even going to school? You know? Should I just drop out and just, you know, get jobs that are, you know, I mean, that's not enough, that's not a viable option for me either.You know, I just, I don't, I wanna make sure that I'm centered here so that I can go out there and do the best I can with maintaining composure, and then trying to get ahead. But if I'm not okay here, here, you know, I just, I don't think that I have, I don't stand a chance, you know?;;change100;high;reducing recidivism;201;therapist;So the-the-the law of, um, felony convictions is-is something that you don't have any control over. I mean, nobody does. So, um, you know, and I'm thinking about how you were talking about getting all the way through the interview and then getting rejected, you know, versus being upfront about it and-and even on the telephone to see whether it's a deal breaker or not, because it must- it sounds like it's so much harder to have that good interview and walk out of there ad know you've done well, and then get turned down.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;202;client;Yeah. I mean, I just recently had one of those where I was gonna be offered. I- he-- I think he was-- I'm pretty sure he was offering him a really good job.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;203;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;204;client;And, uh, it was an interview given to me by my brother, you know, who knew the guy. And, um, it went great until he gave me the paperwork to sign for a background check. And I said, well, you know, I'll sign it, but I just wanna let you know that this is what you're gonna find.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;205;therapist;And your brother didn't know that when he gave you the lead on the job, that there was a background check involved?;question;100;high;reducing recidivism;206;client;No, he did. He said, you know, don't say anything until, you know-- I don't know if I know what he said. I think he said that he's not sure if they do.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;207;therapist;Okay.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;208;client;He said, just go ahead and give it a shot anyway, you know, and, um, I just, I figured I'd just give her a shot, but I think I like your, I think to spare myself some, uh, frustration and further agony-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;209;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;210;client;"-I think that I might try that. I think I might try, you know, from now on you know, uh, finding like a tactful way of asking, you know, I don't wanna be blunt about it and go you know, ""Do you hire criminals?"" or anything.";;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;211;therapist;You're not a criminal.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;212;client;I'm a former criminal though.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;213;therapist;That's right. You're rehabilitated.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;214;client;Yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;215;therapist;A plus shining new guy.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;216;client;Right. So, I know that I am a new guy, but, uh, they don't, you know, so I think society's a lot less forgiving.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;217;therapist;Oh, I think so, too.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;218;client;And individuals, and um, so I think I'm gonna try-- I think that's a really good idea is to kind of like weed out, you know, but how do you say that? You know. How-how do you possibly tell somebody, you know, how do you- how do you get that out there before you go in?;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;219;therapist;I guess I would just have a tendency to say it. I'm a recovering person, and back in my former life, I have a felony conviction. And before we go any further, I don't wanna waste your time. Uh, would that be a problem in even getting the interview, what would you think about saying something like that?;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;220;client;Hmm. Seems, uh, sort of forward, you know, but I-I think that it's probably better if I do tell them so I don't waste my time and hope.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;221;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;222;client;You know, yeah. I think I'm gonna try that from now on.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;223;therapist;Okay. I mean, I'd be happy if you wanna work on a few, you know, things, uh, to write down that sound comfy and fit, you know, how you talk and you use words and stuff. 'Cause I-I also think, you know, interviewing is a good schoo- a good skill, and the more you do it, the better you get at it. And you've been getting a lot of practice at it. So that's-that's been useful too.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;224;client;Yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;225;therapist;I mean, even-even though you get turned down, that feels terrible. The actual and, I bet you with every single one, you get better at it.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;226;client;Yeah. I mean the interview process-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;227;therapist;Uh-huh, uh-huh.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;228;client;-itself, no, I don't think I ever- yeah. No, I-I mean, I don't believe that I have a problem with the actual interview process.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;229;therapist;Yeah. I bet you're even better now.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;230;client;Yeah. It's been a lot.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;231;therapist;You got lots of practice.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;232;client;Been a lot, yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;233;therapist;Yeah. Well then lastly, just getting back, um, to this, another source that that same client was an advocacy group called the John Howard Society.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;234;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;235;therapist;I don't know if you've ever-;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;236;client;I have heard of it. I haven't-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;237;therapist;Yeah.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;238;client;-looked into it yet, but-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;239;therapist;Uh, he, yeah, uh, he- they have a lot of, uh, they have a lot of really good stuff on there about this because they're trying to change the laws about that because-;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;240;client;Yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;241;therapist;-they are so, um, they are so prejudicial. They really are. And I would check with the ACLU too. I mean, just as I-I don't know much, and now I'm very curious and I wanna find out about it myself, but yeah.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;242;client;Yeah. I know. I-I've done some research on it for school.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;243;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;244;client;And, uh, it turns out it's a big cause of the recidivism rate. You know-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;245;therapist;Oh, absolutely.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;246;client;-as far as people going back-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;247;therapist;Absolutely.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;248;client;-to what they know, and, uh, and it's, uh, there is prejud- uh, prejudicial motivation, uh, and there is—;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;249;therapist;You're not allowed to vote.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;250;client;It's really frustrating. I know.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;251;therapist;And you're not allowed to vote.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;252;client;I think that- I think- I think ignorance is what really—;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;253;therapist;That shocked me when I found that out.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;254;client;Yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;255;therapist;I couldn't believe that.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;256;client;Yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;257;therapist;Do you know how many millions of people and when you think about that racially, um, hmm.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;258;client;Yeah, exactly.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;259;therapist;Yeah, mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;260;client;You know, I know there's-there's just a lot of- a lot of bullshit.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;261;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;262;client;Yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;263;therapist;That's a great word for it there. Yeah. So, um-;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;264;client;Yeah, to figure out [unintelligible 00:27:30] anyway, you know.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;265;therapist;Yeah. So-so maybe you- if you- if you wanted to, and this is really up to you, you could check out the blogs, you know. Um, I can see if I can track him down and stuff and the John Howard Society. And, um, I'd be really interested if-if you wanna get together to see what you have found out.;therapist_input;100;high;reducing recidivism;266;client;Yeah. I-I, you know, I, you know, like I said, I wanna make sure I come back and, um, kind of get my, um, you know, my overall mental health-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;267;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;268;client;-you know, um, I wouldn't say stable because I'm not that unstable. I just—;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;269;therapist;But this has affected it.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;270;client;It has affected it.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;271;therapist;Rejection-rejection, yeah.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;272;client;Yeah, rejection. Yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;273;therapist;Yeah.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;274;client;So, I just wanna make sure that I'm okay. So-;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;275;therapist;Yeah.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;276;client;-I'll be back and we can, you know, we can discuss it further if you have any information and I'll share whatever I've got.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;277;therapist;I'll do some checking around for you. I will. Yeah.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;278;client;Well, thanks for the suggestions. Yeah.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;279;therapist;Oh, you are welcome. Thanks for being so open with me. I appreciate it.;reflection;100;high;reducing recidivism;280;client;No problem.;;neutral100;high;reducing recidivism;281;therapist;Yeah. Okay.;other;100;high;reducing recidivism;282;client;Thank you.;;neutral102;low;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Liz. Well, thanks for meeting with me today.;other;102;low;managing life;1;client;Sure.;;neutral102;low;managing life;2;therapist;So what's something that you'd like to change or, um, work towards?;question;102;low;managing life;3;client;Well, [sighs] I've been thinking about working out lately. I really want to start working out again. It's-it's been in my mind, I know I need to do it. It's just getting the motivation to do it.;;change102;low;managing life;4;therapist;And you've been talking about that a lot lately. So I really-;reflection;102;low;managing life;5;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral102;low;managing life;6;therapist;-feel like this is something that you need to do soon because, um, a lot of times, you're just a lot of talk. And then, there's no action. And if you really wanna see results, I think it's something that needs to be done. And, you know, stop being lazy ab;therapist_input;102;low;managing life;7;client;Well, I don't know if I'm really being lazy about it. I think it's just that I have a busy schedule.;;sustain102;low;managing life;8;therapist;Yeah.;other;102;low;managing life;9;client;I just need to find the time to do it. And, yes, I might be lacking a little bit of motivation, but I think it's more timing and trying to fit it in.;;sustain102;low;managing life;10;therapist;And that sounds like a lot of excuses to me. So I feel like you had shared with me before that you do have a gym membership. So I think that's something that you just need to fit in your schedule. So for you to really see results that you want, my guess is you need to go about three to four times a week and really fit in that hour workout, um, on a daily basis.;therapist_input;102;low;managing life;11;client;But I think that part of the problem is that I-I don't have three to four times- three to four times a week to do it, or an hour even. I mean, hour is a long time because if I'm working out for an hour that means I'm leaving home to get there-;;sustain102;low;managing life;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;102;low;managing life;13;client;-time there, time back. I mean, it's not just an hour, it's like two hours, realistically.;;sustain102;low;managing life;14;therapist;And it seems like if you really want to see the results you have to put the time in. And if it's gonna take you two hours, then it's gonna take you two hours. And, again, if you want the results that you want, you need to start, and you need to start now.;therapist_input;102;low;managing life;15;client;Well, oh, um, okay.;;change102;low;managing life;16;therapist;All right. Well, um, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow. And I'm hoping that you're gonna be able to tell me that you went to the gym.;therapist_input;102;low;managing life;17;client;Okay.;;change102;low;managing life;18;therapist;Thanks.;other;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Before you go, do you mind if I take a look at the questionnaire you filled out before the visit?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Thanks. I want you to know that whenever patients and I talk about alcohol and drugs, my role is to share information and learn from what they want to do, if anything. Does that make sense?;therapist_input;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Great. So, you wrote here that you've used alcohol in the last year on at least eight days?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah. Somewhere around eight days. I'm not sure.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay. How would you describe your drinking?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Um, I really only drink at parties. I don't drink at home or anything.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. What kind of alcohol do you drink at parties?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Um, liquor, whenever people are mixing, um, vodka, sometimes beer, but I don't like beer very much. Um, the drinks at parties are usually like vodka and orange juice or gin and tonics.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;How much do you think you usually drink at a party?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;You mean the whole time I'm there?;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Yes.;other;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Um, probably four or five drinks.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Speaker 1: Okay. You checked the box here that drinking helps you feel relaxed, feel better about yourself or fit in?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Yeah. It makes me feel relaxed.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;And you also checked that sometimes you forget things when you drink.;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;What kind of things do you forget?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Um, I forget how many drinks I've had like when a friend asks me or I forget whose house I'm at.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Sometimes you forget where you're at.;reflection;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Right.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Here's the part where I share information. The safest level of drinking for teenagers is zero drinks. That's because we know a number of negative things are more likely to happen when adolescents drink. We know alcohol can harm how the brain develops as an adolescent and teens who drink are more likely to hurt themselves by accident. Sexual assault is another thing more likely to happen and so are sexually transmitted diseases. I'm curious, do you think your drinking has anything to do what the possibility of having an STD?;therapist_input;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Um, yeah. I was drinking the last time I had sex. Um, the guy had been drinking too, and we didn't use a condom.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Do you remember giving consent when you had sex?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Yeah. We've had sex before and we've used a condom before.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;How do you think drinking alcohol affected using a condom this time?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Well, we just didn't stop to put one on. We weren't thinking that way.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Sounds like drinking changes how you think in those moments?;reflection;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Yeah. I would've definitely told him to put on a condom if I was sober.;;change104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;There's something else I wanna share. When people forget where they are or how many drinks they've had, that's a sign of heavy drinking. And when people keep drinking despite experiencing negative consequences, that can be a sign of what we call alcohol use disorder.;therapist_input;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Well, that's not me. I don't need help from anyone.;;sustain104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;I'm curious. What do you like about drinking alcohol?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Um, well, it's fun. I like drinking when my friends are drinking too. Um, I laugh more. It's just fun.;;sustain104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Okay. And what about your drinking do you not like?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Um, I don't like forgetting where I'm at sometimes.;;change104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Anything else?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;I really don't want any STDs.;;change104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;Right. So, on one hand, you like the feeling of being relaxed and having fun when you're drinking and on the other hand, you don't like forgetting where you are or forgetting how many drinks you've had and you don't like putting yourself at risk for STDs?;reflection;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Yeah.;;change104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;So, when you think about what you like and not like about your drinking, where do you wanna go from here? What would you like to change about your drinking?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Well, I definitely don't want to drink too much again.;;change104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;How ready are you to not drink too much? If I asked you to pick a number on a scale of 0 to 10, and 10 being totally ready, what number would you pick?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Um, a nine.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Very ready to stop drinking too much. Why do you think you picked such a high number like nine rather than a lower number like a six or a seven?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;Well, I really don't want any STDs and I don't like wondering whether I have one or not.;;change104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Okay. What plan could you come up with to make sure you achieve that goal?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Um, well, I wanna count my drinks so I don't have more than two and I want to stop drinking once I start feeling drunk.;;change104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Great. Who could help you reach this goal?;question;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Well, I have this friend who thinks I drink too much. She would probably be willing to make me promise not to have more than two drinks at a party.;;change104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Okay. And how about unprotected sex? It sounds like you don't want to experience that again.;reflection;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;I'm going to talk with him and I'm gonna make him promise that we always use a condom and that we don't have sex drunk.;;change104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;All right. So, you're very motivated to change your drinking and you have a plan to keep from drinking more than two drinks at parties and keep from having unprotected sex. I would like to share how it's working for you. What do you think about coming back in six weeks or so?;reflection;104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Okay.;;neutral104;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Great. Thanks for talking with me and I look forward to seeing you again soon.;other;105;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;. So, um, tell me about the exercise.;question;105;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Well, um, since we spoke last, I've been to the gym a couple of times.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;You have?;question;105;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;I have.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;That's fantastic.;other;105;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;Yeah, and actually, my pants feel a little better too. I'm very pleased with it.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;So, what else have you noticed other than your-your pants are fitting better?;question;105;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;Um, I do feel better.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;105;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;My back—;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;Your-- my what?;question;105;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;Well, my back doesn't hurt nearly so much.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Wow.;other;105;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;And, um, but it seems like it's, um-- but it's still hard. I'd like to go more often or I-I guess that I'm-- I just need to be a little more patient with myself because it's, um, I'm not, uh, I'm not-- I wanna be able to like spend more time at the gym but right now, it's um, not, um-- Well, I guess I need to build up to it.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;Mm-hmm. So and what would you-- What would- What would help you get to building up to it? Spending more time there.;question;105;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Um, well, I guess just sticking with it and not getting, um, sidetracked.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;105;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;Like last week, I-I didn't get there at all until like Thursday during the week,-;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;105;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;so it was- it was a frustrating week like for the gym that way.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;105;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;I was kinda busy with some other things, but, um—;;neutral105;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;Mm-hmm. But you made it-- You made it one day-;reflection;105;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;I-I got—;;neutral105;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;instead of zero days.;reflection;105;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;Yeah, and actually, I made it again on Saturday too. So.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;That's fantastic.;other;105;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;Yeah.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;Even with this, you know, pretty horrendous schedule going on.;reflection;105;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;Yeah. It's been a little-little hectic, you know. And, uh-- But, I-I don't like it too much because there's all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they can stay on the treadmill longer and it-it-it's a little discouraging, you know. 'Cause I don't know if you've noticed, I'm not buff and they are. And it's-it's a little discouraging to think how much work it's gonna take to get, you know, kinda back towards that.;;sustain105;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;So you-you'd like to get buffed?;question;105;high;diet and weight loss management;31;client;No, but, um, when-when I'm not at the gym, and I am my normal rational self, I realize that I'm, you know, way, way past the age of where I would really even want to do that, let alone want to spend the time it takes. But then while I'm at the gym, and I see the buff young guys, you know, lifting a lot of weight and all that stuff, then you know, the-- I don't know, the urge to be buff comes up in me.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;32;therapist;So, but for right now, it sounds like the-- just having the pants fit better-;reflection;105;high;diet and weight loss management;33;client;Yeah.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;34;therapist;-sounds really, you know, like it's making you feel good about yourself and—;reflection;105;high;diet and weight loss management;35;client;It is.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;36;therapist;What other positive things have you noticed about the exercise?;question;105;high;diet and weight loss management;37;client;Well, I noticed-- Well, I-I still need to work on my diet a lot. I haven't-- I-I'd like to say that by working out at the gym, I have, uh, I've -I've modified my diet, but I haven't very much. I've gotten a little bit better with that, but I'd like to do a lot more.;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;38;therapist;In what way have you gotten a little bit better?;question;105;high;diet and weight loss management;39;client;"Um, a little bit less junk food. Um, like at times, when I'm like I feel like, ""Oh, I think I'll just go have a candy bar,"" or some worthless thing like that I'll actually have second thoughts before I do it.";;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;40;therapist;So you're at the second thought part. And what do you think would-- might take you, uh, over to actually doing it if you wanted to?;question;105;high;diet and weight loss management;41;client;Well, I think, uh, when I really start seeing some results at the gym, it's kinda, uh, I think the way it works in my mind is if I've worked out really hard and I've- and I've-- say I've lost a pound that week-;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;42;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;105;high;diet and weight loss management;43;client;"-you know, and then as I'm looking at that double or triple fudge four-decker of ice cream Sunday thing, you know, that somebody is eating, I would say, ""Wow, that would be about two hours on the treadmill."" Then-then that would be probably-- the-- that w";;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;44;therapist;Oh, okay. The payoff just wouldn't be worth that two hours of treadmill versus that double fudgy browny thingy.;reflection;105;high;diet and weight loss management;45;client;Right, decadent-- Why do they put the word decadent in food?;;change105;high;diet and weight loss management;46;therapist;'Cause it is decadent, it's lovely.;therapist_input;105;high;diet and weight loss management;47;client;Okay.;;neutral105;high;diet and weight loss management;48;therapist;Yeah, yummy, so-;therapist_input;105;high;diet and weight loss management;49;client;Okay. But it seems to be going so far so good. I-I guess, you know, I can like, you know, um, I-I'm-I'm pretty pleased with who-- how it's going on. Um, I'm really-- I'm glad we talked that last time 'cause it-it was the impetus to get me to go the first time in a long, long time.;;change106;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Okay, so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aiden and that should help with the ear infection, but in looking through the chart, I mean, it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so.;other;106;low;smoking cessation;1;client;Yeah.;;neutral106;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;That's really a big problem.;other;106;low;smoking cessation;3;client;Yeah, it's pretty stressful for both of us. He gets really upset.;;neutral106;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking?;question;106;low;smoking cessation;5;client;Yeah, I-- Yeah, I do smoke, but I don't smoke around him. I try really hard not to smoke around him.;;neutral106;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke, and so, what can you tell me about that?;other;106;low;smoking cessation;7;client;I-I don't know. I mean, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I don't smoke in the car. Um, when he's home, I go outside to smoke. I just-- I mean, I know it's bad, and I know it's bad for him, so I don't want him to be around it so I try really hard.;;neutral106;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;I really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden. Did you know s-smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections, it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also, things like vitamin C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of risk. In addition to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?;therapist_input;106;low;smoking cessation;9;client;No, but I don't smoke. I'm-- I-I-I've thought about quitting, but it's just- It's really hard so I just don't know how to do it.;;neutral106;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease, for all kinds of things-;other;106;low;smoking cessation;11;client;I know, I know. I've heard-- People have told me before, I've heard all that. I just don't know how to do it. How am I supposed to quit? It's-it's so hard.;;sustain106;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Well, there's all kinds of things you can use now. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum, there's the inhaler, there's nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban, there's quit smoking groups you can go to, there's hotlines you can call.;therapist_input;106;low;smoking cessation;13;client;I just don't have time for any of that.;;sustain106;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit, this is really important.;other;106;low;smoking cessation;15;client;I understand that. I know it is. I mean, everybody has problems, right? It's just really-- It's really, really hard.;;neutral106;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Well, what can be more important to you than the health of your child?;other;106;low;smoking cessation;17;client;I don't know.;;neutral106;low;smoking cessation;18;therapist;I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important.;other;106;low;smoking cessation;19;client;I'll-I'll-I'll go look at all those things and-and I'll find-- I guess I'll-I'll try to find something, and-and I'll talk to my doctor about it.;;change106;low;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Okay. Well, I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger.;other;106;low;smoking cessation;21;client;Okay, whatever. Okay.;;sustain106;low;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Okay.;other;108;high;managing life;0;therapist;Well, I want to thank you for coming in today to see me. Um, I do understand from talking with your counselor that you've got quite a bit on your plate, you've got a lot going on. Can you tell me a little bit about that?;therapist_input;108;high;managing life;1;client;Well, um, I have a two-year-old son, and then I work full time as a server at a restaurant, and then recently, I also started going back to night class, so you know, just the combination of all that, you know. I-I've just been feeling really stressed lately.;;neutral108;high;managing life;2;therapist;Yeah, I could see that. Um, may I ask, are you also a single mom?;question;108;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral108;high;managing life;4;therapist;So you've got a lot of stressors right now. You're a single mom raising a two-year-old, you're working full time, and you're going back to school. What do you think would be the most helpful for us to focus on today?;reflection;108;high;managing life;5;client;Well, I-I told the counselor that I think childcare is probably my-my biggest issue right now.;;neutral108;high;managing life;6;therapist;Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about that?;question;108;high;managing life;7;client;Yeah. Um, well, my mom normally watches my son, but lately, it's kind of becoming a problem. You know, she like will back out at the last second, and so I've had to call in at work a couple of times. I've had to miss class a few times. So i-it's just stressful worrying about, you know, whether I'll be able to do those things or not.;;neutral108;high;managing life;8;therapist;Okay. So I'm hearing you say that the situation with your mom's not ideal. You actually miss class sometime and had to lose some work shifts as well, and that's problematic.;reflection;108;high;managing life;9;client;Yeah, exactly.;;neutral108;high;managing life;10;therapist;Okay. Um, outside your mom, is there anyone else that can help with childcare?;question;108;high;managing life;11;client;Um, well, I have a sister, but I don't really trust her to watch my son, and I don't really know that many people that-- the only thing I can think of, I have this one neighbor who stepped in and helped one time when my mom backed out. She-she actually has, uh, a three-year-old daughter, so you know, kind of worked out.;;neutral108;high;managing life;12;therapist;Okay.;other;108;high;managing life;13;client;Um, I don't really know her that well, but I mean, she seems nice and I-I think she did a pretty good job that night.;;neutral108;high;managing life;14;therapist;Hmm. So what I hear you saying is this neighbor was supportive when you really needed her to be.;reflection;108;high;managing life;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral108;high;managing life;16;therapist;Stepped in last minute. Um, when you picked up your son, you didn't have any concerns and he seemed happy?;reflection;108;high;managing life;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral108;high;managing life;18;therapist;Okay. Let's pursue that neighbor a little bit. Um, people like that, I like to think of as natural resources, but I know for a lot of people, the major problem with, uh, childcare is affordability.;therapist_input;108;high;managing life;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral108;high;managing life;20;therapist;Have you given any thought to, if you'll be able to afford to pay someone on a regular basis to watch your son?;question;108;high;managing life;21;client;I-- you know, I mean, maybe a little bit, but I don't really make that much money to be able to afford something like daycare or, you know, like full time babysitting.;;neutral108;high;managing life;22;therapist;Yeah, I can understand that. Um, what are some of your natural skills?;question;108;high;managing life;23;client;Well, I mean, I-I like cooking. I'm-I'm actually in school for culinary arts.;;neutral108;high;managing life;24;therapist;Oh, I bet you're a really good cook then. Um, what would you think about a plan where you worked out an arrangement with this neighbor, where in exchange for her watching your son, you would prepare dinner for her and her, um, daughter?;therapist_input;108;high;managing life;25;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral108;high;managing life;26;therapist;Um, you know, you could maybe swap a meal for child care. What do you think of a idea like that?;therapist_input;108;high;managing life;27;client;Hmm. That's, that's interesting. I-I never really thought of something like that, but, yeah, it might work.;;neutral108;high;managing life;28;therapist;Okay. Okay, I'm glad you think so. Um, so, other than this neighbor, or is there anyone else that could help you?;question;108;high;managing life;29;client;Hmm. No, I-- you know, there-there just aren't that many people I trust right now with my son.;;neutral108;high;managing life;30;therapist;Okay, I can respect that. You-you really have to go with kind of your gut and follow your own intuition on that. Um, what about the baby's father, is he of any help?;question;108;high;managing life;31;client;[chuckles] No, no, not at all. He, he really hasn't been in the picture since my son was born.;;neutral108;high;managing life;32;therapist;Okay, fine. You know what? We've got one really good lead with the neighbor. I think if you would follow up in pursuing that, you might find some relief and resolve some of your childcare issues. Um, how many days a week are you in school?;therapist_input;108;high;managing life;33;client;It's-it's three nights right now, so I have class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights.;;neutral108;high;managing life;34;therapist;Okay. Um, so what would it look like if you had a plan where both your neighbor and your mom were helping you out?;question;108;high;managing life;35;client;Um, well, you know, if my neighbor could even just take over one day of watching my son, I think that would help my mom quite a bit.;;neutral108;high;managing life;36;therapist;Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, if you could just reduce the amount of time that you're needing your mom, she might be more supportive, more onboard?;reflection;108;high;managing life;37;client;I mean, I think so, yeah.;;neutral108;high;managing life;38;therapist;All right. Um, so what do you think would be your next steps in working out a plan between your neighbor and your mom?;question;108;high;managing life;39;client;Mom, you know, just, I guess talking to my neighbor and seeing if she's even interested in this idea, and if she is, you know, telling my mom about it and, you know, hopefully, that will make her feel a little better and maybe a little bit more reliable.;;neutral108;high;managing life;40;therapist;Okay. Sounds like you got a good plan to follow up on there. All right. Um, now you mentioned that your son is two. When will he turn three?;reflection;108;high;managing life;41;client;Just a couple months from now. He's almost three.;;neutral108;high;managing life;42;therapist;Okay. Well, in that I-- in that case, I've got another idea for you. Um, what about, um, maybe when he turns three, you could enroll him in Head Start? Are you familiar with that program?;therapist_input;108;high;managing life;43;client;I've heard of it, but I don't know that much.;;neutral108;high;managing life;44;therapist;Okay. Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program. Um, it was really created for parents and families, just like yours, folks who have a lower income and fewer resources, but Head Start really prepares your child both socially and intellectually for going to school. Um, and you know, by the time he turns three, you may find that that routine is something that's better for him to get used to before he starts kindergarten. Uh, would you like some more information on local Head Start sites?;therapist_input;108;high;managing life;45;client;Yeah, I mean, it sounds like it would be really good for my son and, you know, it would help me out in terms of childcare for sure.;;neutral108;high;managing life;46;therapist;Okay. Well, good. Um, all right. It sounds like you've got a good plan there going forward. Um, now I did see from the nurse practitioner's notes, you're also working on reducing your smoking and your drinking. How's that going?;question;108;high;managing life;47;client;[chuckles] Well, you know, I-I've been working on it a couple of weeks now, and honestly, it's been a lot harder than I expected. Um, trying to break my routine in the evenings, especially has-has been hard, but, um, you know, a couple of nights I have reached my goal in terms of, you know, number of cigarettes I'm going to smoke and number of drinks. So, I mean, I've done okay some days, but others, not so much.;;neutral108;high;managing life;48;therapist;Okay. So what I hear you say is that it was a bigger challenge than you expected, yeah, but you're working on it. You're-you're still committed to it. So yeah, that's really to be commended. I just want to ask you one thing though. Have you thought about secondhand smoke and the dangers of that and how that might be impacting your son?;reflection;108;high;managing life;49;client;Yeah, yeah. I definitely have, so I-I try to never smoke around him, and if I do smoke at home, I always go out to the balcony to smoke.;;neutral108;high;managing life;50;therapist;Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your next steps in getting that going?;reflection;108;high;managing life;51;client;Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it. Hopefully, that kind of helps her situation out. And then, um, I'm definitely want to look into the Head Start idea because I think that would be really good.;;neutral108;high;managing life;52;therapist;Okay, okay. Good. Um, I think you've got a good plan there. Um, what would you say to us getting back together, say, in two weeks, just for us to kind of revisit and see what kind of progress you've made, you know, if you've got something worked out, great, but if you've hit a bump in the road, I tell you what, we'll put our heads together. We'll come up with another plan.;question;108;high;managing life;53;client;Okay.;;neutral108;high;managing life;54;therapist;All right. Good. Well, I want to thank you again for coming in today, Sarah. It was really nice to have met you.;other;108;high;managing life;55;client;Thanks. All right.;;neutral108;high;managing life;56;therapist;You're very welcome.;other;109;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Okay, hard part's over. So the good news is no cavities.;therapist_input;109;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Oh, great.;;neutral109;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Yes, always happy to hear that. I do have some concerns though because I'm seeing some irritation in your mouth in the palate that's called nicotinic stomatitis and-;therapist_input;109;high;smoking cessation;3;client;That sounds bad.;;neutral109;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Yeah, it is. It's some damage to the roof of your mouth that happens from tobacco smoking and so I'm wondering if you can tell me a little bit how-- about how tobacco fits in your life right now.;question;109;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Tobacco. Well, I don't smoke cigarettes. I've never smoked cigarettes. I do go out with my friends. Um, you know, we go out to bars and, you know, we'll have a few drinks and smoke some of those little cigarillo-type things. I mean I wouldn't even think of them as cigars and they're certainly not cigarettes. Um, and I mean I'll have one or two of those in an evening with, uh, with my friends but certainly not 20 or 30 of them a day like you would with cigarettes and that's the only thing that could possibly have anything to do with tobacco.;;neutral109;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;So you've made a decision in your life not to smoke cigarettes, that's something you didn't want to do. It sounds like you're kinda concerned about the health effects of cigarettes. But you have been smoking the little cigarillos at least one or two every time you go out.;reflection;109;high;smoking cessation;7;client;But that's- that's just like a- a social thing. That's something that my friends and I do. We-- We-- It's not habit or something that I have to have and, you know, talking about one or two when we go out for an evening. Not packs of them.;;sustain109;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Yeah, so you're not-- You're not like those chain smokers, you're not smoking packs and packs a day.;reflection;109;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Oh, no. No.;;neutral109;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;The amount you smoke is so miniscule you can't even imagine that it would cause any harm and yet here it is damaging the roof of your mouth.;reflection;109;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Well, we've-- you have a point there. Mm, now that you mention it, um, I have started having one or two at work, you know, when we have break since I have a couple of friends at work that smoke and so every time we have a break, you know, we all go out to the- the break place outside, um, and so I- now I go with them and I have one of these Swisher Sweets. Um, I like the peach flavor [unintelligible 00:02:32] they're so cute. But that's really only pretty recently.;;neutral109;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Uh-huh. So smoking has kind of become a big part of your social life now. When you go out, you're smoking, and even during breaks at work, you're smoking.;reflection;109;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, yeah, yeah. You know now that you say it like that it's true. Um, I am smoking on a daily basis.;;neutral109;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;So aside from that social aspect, what are the things you like about it?;question;109;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Well, it's relaxing and it's just nice to be with people, um. Um, and you know, when, you know, I like to go to Las Vegas, and so when we go to Vegas, it's really fun to go to the cigar bars, is kind of sophisticated and fun and so, you know, it's mostly a social thing.;;sustain109;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Okay.;other;109;high;smoking cessation;17;client;I wouldn't say I was a chain smoker.;;sustain109;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Okay. How about the other side? Have you noticed any not-so-good things about the smoking?;question;109;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Well, I was going to ask you about, um, whitening my teeth because I've noticed that they have more stains on them up than a few years ago, and so I imagine that has something to do with the smoking.;;change109;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about?;question;109;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Um. Well, there's the expense, you know. Wi-with the economy and all, um, I- I have to be careful about my money and so, um, there is the extra expense of if I'm buying more of them than I used to. So the-the money aspect is also a concern.;;change109;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Mm-hmm. So there's your oral health, there's the financial aspect, and then e-earlier you brought up some concerns about smoking cigarettes and how that can be harmful for you.;reflection;109;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Oh, yeah.;;change109;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Were you aware of the fact that smoking these little cigarillos, the Swisher Sweets, can have some of the same negative health effects?;question;109;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Oh, absolutely not. I mean I thought of it more as a- a fun thing to do with my friends, certainly not a smoking habit or anything that would be harmful.;;neutral109;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Mm-hmm. So it's kind of surprising to you that something you've been doing and you've been doing more and more of it is actually pretty bad for you.;reflection;109;high;smoking cessation;27;client;"Oh, yes. I checked the box on your form when you asked if I use tobacco, I checked ""No,"" because I never thought of myself as a smoker.";;neutral109;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Mm-hmm. What do you kind of make of that now that you realize that you're actually a tobacco user and that you might actually be causing some pretty se-serious health effects.;question;109;high;smoking cessation;29;client;I'm really concerned, I mean, I don't want to, um, develop cancer, lung cancer, or any of the awful things that happen from smoking, and, you know, really, until this conversation, I never really thought of myself as a smoker at all. So-;;change109;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;109;high;smoking cessation;31;client;-I'm very concerned.;;change109;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Well, the good news is in terms of the nicotinic stomatitis, at the point in which you stop smoking, you can actually reverse all the negative effects that occurred and you might also know that you can stop the progression of any other diseases that had started, just by quitting smoking.;therapist_input;109;high;smoking cessation;33;client;Really?;;neutral109;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Yeah. Is that something you'd be interested in?;question;109;high;smoking cessation;35;client;Oh, I would. I really would because, like I said, I'm a brand new smoker. I didn't know I was a smoker until I came to see you.;;change109;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, if you think about it on a scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is really don't think you could do it at all and 10 is really confident that you could quit if you tried, where do you think you fall?;question;109;high;smoking cessation;37;client;Oh, I think I will probably be in seven or eight. I'm-I'm pretty confident that I could stop doing this.;;change109;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay, what made you choose seven or eight as opposed to a-a five?;question;109;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Because it's not a part of my daily life. I don't have to have, uh, a smoke when I get up in the morning. I don't smoke 20 or 30 of them a day, so it's not that much exposure and I-I feel pretty confident that I could stop.;;change109;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, it sounds like just to kind of summarize, you've noticed some negative effects of the smoking, you have some concerns about health effects that could occur, there's the financial aspect, and yet you feel pretty confident that you could quit if you tried. So, where do you think we should go from here?;reflection;109;high;smoking cessation;41;client;Um, I'd really like some more information about quitting. I mean, I've heard there's some-some new medications, there are some new things that can be done to help people make quitting more comfortable and I-I really wanna quit.;;change109;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Okay, well, I'd be happy to talk to you more about that and give you some tips and advice and give you some suggestions about where you can get some support with quitting.;therapist_input;109;high;smoking cessation;43;client;That'd be wonderful. Thank you.;;neutral109;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;I really appreciate you talking to me about this today.;other;109;high;smoking cessation;45;client;Thank you.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;0;therapist;Hi, are you Katie?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;1;client;Yeah.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;2;therapist;Hi, my name is Beth. I'm the nurse that works with the nurse practitioner Mrs. Smith that you just saw. Do you have a moment to talk?;therapist_input;111;high;reducing drug use;3;client;Uh, sure. What's this about?;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;4;therapist;I know you were here to get a prescription for birth control but while you were waiting to see Mrs. Smith, you filled out a healthy habits questionnaire-;therapist_input;111;high;reducing drug use;5;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;6;therapist;and you answered some questions about your marijuana use. would it be Okay if I asked you some questions about how marijuana plays a role in your life?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;7;client;Sure.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;8;therapist;I notice you use marijuana regularly, and I wanted to ask you more about that.;therapist_input;111;high;reducing drug use;9;client;Well, you know they just decriminalized it in Virginia, it's not a big deal. I'm not in trouble, am I?;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;10;therapist;No. No, no, no. Not at all. Um, I just wanted to ask you how it helps you and how you use it. Can you tell me a little more about how you use it?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;11;client;It's not a big deal. It's just like a couple times a week to relax.;;sustain111;high;reducing drug use;12;therapist;Marijuana is really useful in your life in helping you relax?;reflection;111;high;reducing drug use;13;client;Yeah. I mean, I'm here on an academic scholarship so I have to keep my grades up and I'm on the debate team, so there's a lot going on.;;sustain111;high;reducing drug use;14;therapist;Mm. You're a very successful student and you have a lot of responsibilities, and it's really adding to your stress.;reflection;111;high;reducing drug use;15;client;Well, yeah. The truth is I'm the first in my family to go to college so I don't know, I guess, I'm in a bit over my head.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;16;therapist;Mm. You've been very successful academically and the transition to college has been hard for you.;reflection;111;high;reducing drug use;17;client;I've always been an anxious person. Pot just helps me calm my nerves. I'm I in trouble?;;sustain111;high;reducing drug use;18;therapist;I promise you, you're not in trouble, I wanna help.;therapist_input;111;high;reducing drug use;19;therapist;Uh, tell me besides helping you relax, what are some positives about pot?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;20;client;Well, some of these kids are just so much more sophisticated than me so I guess when I party with them, I feel like I'm fitting in. I don't know how else to explain it.;;sustain111;high;reducing drug use;21;therapist;Hmm. Uh, when you use pot in a group you feel more at home with your peers and more accepted?;reflection;111;high;reducing drug use;22;client;I don't know if I feel more accepted, more like I'm trying to fit in by using it.;;sustain111;high;reducing drug use;23;therapist;So how is it working to help you fit in?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;24;client;I'm not sure it is.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;25;therapist;Mm. So smoking pot with your peers to try to fit in more but it doesn't seem to be making you feel more comfortable with your friends.;reflection;111;high;reducing drug use;26;client;Uh, yeah.;;change111;high;reducing drug use;27;therapist;What are some downsides to smoking pot?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;28;client;I don't know. I- It helps me relax but I guess I'm nervous I'll get caught. Um, my parents would kill me if they knew that I smoked.;;change111;high;reducing drug use;29;therapist;So smoking pot doesn't help you feel more socially comfortable with your peers and it increases your stress because you're worried about your family and legal consequences?;reflection;111;high;reducing drug use;30;client;Yeah.;;change111;high;reducing drug use;31;therapist;Can you think of any other downsides to smoking pot?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;32;client;Well, I don't have the money for it. I just usually bum it off to my roommate, her parents give her a lot of spending money but I don't know, it's kind of embarrassing to have to do that.;;change111;high;reducing drug use;33;therapist;So smoking pot also reminds you of your financial situation and you don't have extra cash to spend on things?;reflection;111;high;reducing drug use;34;client;Yeah.;;change111;high;reducing drug use;35;therapist;Katie, it sounds like smoking pot is helping you somewhat in helping you relax and it's also causing you a lot of stress because you're trying to use it to fit in and that's not helping, you're worried about getting caught, you're worried about family disapproval. Having said all that, what do you think you wanna do about your pot use?;reflection;111;high;reducing drug use;36;client;I don't know. When you put it that way, it doesn't sound like a very good habit.;;change111;high;reducing drug use;37;therapist;Would it be okay if I made a suggestion?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;38;client;Okay.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;39;therapist;You mentioned at the beginning of our conversation that you have a history of dealing with anxiety, have you ever talked to a counselor about that?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;40;client;No. We don't do that kind of thing in my family.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;41;therapist;Can you tell me more?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;42;client;It's just not done. I don't know. It's something for crazy people and we definitely do not have the money for it.;;sustain111;high;reducing drug use;43;therapist;Mm. So the idea of counseling in your family is for crazy people only and it's looked down upon and the cost would cause a problem too?;reflection;111;high;reducing drug use;44;client;Yeah. I just don't see it happening.;;sustain111;high;reducing drug use;45;therapist;Katie, we know that many kids come to college and have a lot of stress and deal with a lot of anxiety, and we've also found that when they talk to our counselors and learn specific skills about dealing with anxiety, they do much better. Um, and it's been really successful for a lot of kids. Um, I'm wondering if you think it might be helpful for you?;therapist_input;111;high;reducing drug use;46;client;I don't know.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;47;therapist;Can you describe why you're hesitant?;question;111;high;reducing drug use;48;client;Well, I don't have the money for it so I can't pay for it and my parents wouldn't approve.;;sustain111;high;reducing drug use;49;therapist;Well, the cost is free and the counseling services we provide, we are legally obligated to protect your privacy. We can't tell your parents. There are some exceptions to that privacy rule, including, uh, mostly if we're concerned about- that your safety.;therapist_input;111;high;reducing drug use;50;client;What, like suicidal?;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;51;therapist;Exactly.;other;111;high;reducing drug use;52;client;Uh, I would never do that.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;53;therapist;Well, uh, we can go into some more specifics if you decide to see the counselor about what-what privacy rules there are, but for the most part, you wouldn't need to worry about us sharing anything with your parents.;therapist_input;111;high;reducing drug use;54;client;Okay. I guess I'll think about it.;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;55;therapist;So, uh, if-if you're walking out now, I can walk out with you and just take you around our counseling center. I can even introduce you to one of the counselors.;therapist_input;111;high;reducing drug use;56;client;Do I have to go there?;;neutral111;high;reducing drug use;57;therapist;No. No, no. I just wanted to show you where it is and let- make sure you know about our resources here at the college.;therapist_input;111;high;reducing drug use;58;client;Okay, sure. I agree, let's go.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So, Chris, I wanted to talk to you. Um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. I really value you as a team player. As Athletic Director, one of my jobs is to, kind of, keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best. And something came up this weekend. I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.;therapist_input;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay, oh, actually, could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately. Well, prior to that party, like, as you know, I'm a honor student and my parents, like, they keep me very, like k-kept down out of the, like so- like social life.;;neutral112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;And, um, about a month ago, my friends invited me to a party. And they used the fact that, Oh, I'm always doing my homework, I'm always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on-- well, that party, I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house. So, that's when I started drinking.;;neutral112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;"It was a- it was a unique experience, as you can say. I guess you can say. And, I don't know, I-- It was fun, at least, in the moment. So, I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my-- I begged my mom to let me go to another party. And she, kind of, knew what I was doing. She asked me to, like, to promise her of no alcohol, no drugs. Then I'll pick you up by 12:00. And I-I was surprised. 12:00-12:00, that's basically when the party starts, but I told her whatever-- I thought- I thought to myself that I'll-I'll come-- I'll figure out to delay her, can you pick me up later? So later, so she-- I promised that-- She dropped me off, I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So I-- we go, I have fun like I've been having. And I was drinking. And then the time- the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon-- I couldn't delay her from picking me up. And as soon as she picked me up, and I stepped in the car, she said, ""You drank vodka."" And I'm like, I-I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor. And I-I feel terrible because I-I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.";;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;So, here you are. You're an honors student. You're a star athlete. You've, kind of, been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the party scene.;reflection;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Right.;;neutral112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;And it was fun at first. But now you're already noticing some consequences.;reflection;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Yes, right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;I haven't really-- I kind of just sit in class like-- I-- my mind is elsewhere, especially on the weekends, where instead of-- I was- I was instead of studying, I caught up with my friends, trying to find where we can-- I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that.;;neutral112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;It's really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?;question;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;I don't know. It-It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when- not when I'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like a social environment. I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious, I would say. And when I- when I drink, I feel, I don't know, like, it relaxes me. I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. I don't know it just—;;sustain112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;So, it helps you, kind of, loosen up, feel more relaxed.;reflection;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Exactly.;;sustain112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though your mom got mad at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well in school, maybe-;reflection;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Kind of.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;or any other things?;question;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Just different groups, friends or groups, girlfriends, like different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of scene.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;So, that-that-that's also changed.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;So, your-your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now.;reflection;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;A little bit because not all of them are into that. So, like, I'm in one group of friends, and I would talk to another person that's an another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.;;neutral112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;So, since then, I've been hanging out more with them, getting to know them. But I can also see that oh, I'm just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;As they are there for me, you know.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?;question;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Oh, um, I feel I should st-stop. I mean, like, I'm not-not unrealistic. I understand that situations like this will happen.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;It's just up to me not to take it so far, where I can't remember the night before, if I'm puking. All I remember is the toilet-;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;-that's-that's not worth it, either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow. It's little so I guess may seem to other people.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Yeah.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;But to me then it's a big thing.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Your mom is really important to you.;reflection;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;Of course.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;And how she feels about you is important to you.;reflection;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Exactly.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;How important is it to you to make, uh, an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit?;question;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;A lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Okay.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;And also getting back on top of my school work again my athletics too.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Okay.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;So I feel that there-there's a future in that.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or-or even cut down or quit?;question;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;I'm pretty confident, especially.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;O-on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all 10 is completely what number would you give.;question;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Probably like an 8 or 9.;;neutral112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Okay.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;And that can't be a ten there's nothing as ten in life I feel. Like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?;question;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Because I don't know I feel deter-determined to-to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I-I betrayed my mother. I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;It's not a pleasant experience. Uh, it's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens, like all the fun that I have and prior to that just it's not worth-it's not worth drinking.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;All right, what do you think's a realistic goal for you then?;question;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;To make sure I have my studies. Well first, try to get-get back my trust with mother-;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;-then just focus on my studies. Then if I have time for leisure time like I'll go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesn't mean I have to drink. And I do one cup is not going to do anything to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;So your goal is kind of to do not drink at all or if you are at a party, uh, a maximum of one at the very most.;reflection;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Exactly. Just so I take part with the social convention but it's not. Hey guys.;;change112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Yeah. Chris, I really appreciate you talking with me about this. I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and, you know, like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you. So I'm glad we were able to talk about this. It really seems like you have a good plan going forward, you know, really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol, making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum. It sounds like something that will work for you.;reflection;112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;And-and thank you for listening me listening to me. It means a lot to me.;;neutral112;high;reducing alcohol consumption;64;therapist;It's my-- yeah it's my pleasure. It's part of my job and it's probably like this so. I'm going to hurry up and get changed for practice.;therapist_input;113;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Hi, Sandra.;other;113;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Hi.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by.;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well. I think it's important to quit, but I enjoy smoking. I'm not ready to give it up right now. My life is too much in turmoil.;;sustain113;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;So I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of the things you were thinking about?;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;5;client;I think it's important because I've-- I feel I'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking, so I don't want her to think it's a good thing.;;change113;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;So the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking.;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;7;client;I smoked when I was young, and I certainly don't want it for her.;;change113;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately.;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Well, that's true. It seems so hard. I'm just not ready for this right now.;;sustain113;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it?;question;113;high;smoking cessation;11;client;It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and, you know, talk about things. I would hate to not smoke, really. I'd be left out.;;sustain113;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;What else? Tell me what else is good about it.;question;113;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Hmm, I like to have a cigarette after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full. So it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight.;;sustain113;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it?;question;113;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Let me think. Well, I just enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking. I don't really think about quitting too much.;;sustain113;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out.;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Okay.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke.;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;19;client;That's true. Yeah.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up.;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Yeah.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Exactly.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things?;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;25;client;Well, I-I'm worried about my children. I feel like I'm being a bad parent, and um, I often wonder, you know, they've seen me smoke for years. I certainly don't want my 12-year-old daughter to start smoking, and some of her friends are already smoking.;;change113;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Sandra, can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her?;question;113;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Yeah, just this morning, I was outside having a cigarette, and then when I looked up, there she was looking out the window watching me smoke.;;change113;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;So this morning, that experience, it really brought home how she does watch you, and she does really look up to you and notice what you do. How did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you?;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;29;client;I felt terrible, you know, I was projecting-- I wanna be a good parent, and I don't feel this really is part of the plan.;;change113;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;And again, thanks for your honesty in talking about this. I appreciate that this is a- this is a tough topic. This is a-a hard behavior to think about giving up. Um, I guess one thing that- one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that, you know, on the one hand, you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority, it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter-;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;31;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;-um, and on the other hand, I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief, socializing, and it's something you can't imagine ever changing. How do those two things fit together?;question;113;high;smoking cessation;33;client;It doesn't fit, you know. It's the opposite side of the coin. You know, I love to do it, but I don't think it's right.;;change113;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;So what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important, that raised it up in the list of priorities for you?;question;113;high;smoking cessation;35;client;I can't think of anything right now.;;sustain113;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Okay.;other;113;high;smoking cessation;37;client;I don't have any plans to quit. It's just something I'm thinking about.;;sustain113;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;"So, it's-it's not so much that you don't wanna quit in a way, it's almost, ""How could I do it that would work for me?""";reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Exactly.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Okay. I appreciate. We've- we've probably used up the time that we have. I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this. Is that something that would be helpful?;therapist_input;113;high;smoking cessation;41;client;Oh, sure. Sure, I'll come in. Yeah.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Okay. So I hear-- [crosstalk];other;113;high;smoking cessation;43;client;We can talk about it some more.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;[chuckles] Not necessarily the-the most exciting thing for you to do, but I appreciate you are willing to do that. Can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week? I promise it's not too time-consuming. Um, we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing, who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do, and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change, why you would even consider quitting smoking. And then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about, as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke. Is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days?;therapist_input;113;high;smoking cessation;45;client;Okay, okay, I'll give it a try.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Okay, here you go.;other;113;high;smoking cessation;47;client;Thank you.;;neutral113;high;smoking cessation;48;therapist;So thanks for coming in, Sandra. We'll see you next week.;reflection;113;high;smoking cessation;49;client;All right.;;neutral114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;In summary, the Minnesota State Mankato security report states that you were stopped on stadium road last Friday, cited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox. Plus the report lists your age as 20. Dylan, what is the accuracy of the report? And can you share with me some details leading up to the incident?;question;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Uh, I guess that sound- that sounds right. I mean, I was- I was kinda drunk and it happened like a week ago. I just, I drove over to my friend's house, um, just to go watch the game and, you know, we're having a couple beers and next thing I know the Vikings are kind of losing pretty big. So we drank a little bit more than usual. And I mean, at the end I had to get home and I couldn't find a ride. So I-I just drove.;;neutral114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;You decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing. And when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home, you decided to drive yourself home. Did I get that right?;therapist_input;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah. That's-that's exactly how it happened. I mean, I'm a normal college kid. I like to drink and hanging out with my buddies. I mean, I, it wasn't a big house party or anything and I got busted.;;sustain114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Yeah, I understand that your intention was to have a good time while watching the game with your friends. You didn't think about what could go wrong when you drank alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house and not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home.;reflection;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah. I tried to be safe. I mean, I tried to call her roommate, but I don't know, getting in trouble anyways.;;neutral114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Dylan, you told me what brought you here today, what do you think the problem really is?;question;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Um, well, I wanna say I have a drinking problem. I think I'd probably have more of a, like getting caught problem. I mean, my friends, they-they drink like fishes and I-- they don't ever get caught and you got me over here and I get caught and they left.;;sustain114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Sounds like you attribute your current situation to bad luck. If that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior, what consequences might result?;question;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;I guess- I guess more problems with police and school and I really don't have like the time or the money for any of that.;;sustain114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;How important is it that you avoid future problems with the police or school, Dylan?;question;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;God. It's, I guess, super important, because just-just going to detox alone was-was awful, the experience-- I don't want to do that again. And my dad said if I get suspended from school, um, I have to go- I have to go work on my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would just kill my social life. I won't see any of my friends and I mean, it's already bad enough, like my parents took my car away when I got the DUI.;;change114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Yeah. What would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended?;question;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Well, I guess I- I guess the easy one is I wouldn't- I wouldn't drink so much and I try to avoid situations where I'm more-more likely to get in trouble. So probably I don't wanna drink so much.;;change114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you'll be able to follow through with that plan with 10 being very confident?;question;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Um, I guess I would say like, I don't know, like over halfway. So maybe like a six.;;neutral114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;What steps could you take to move that six to a seven or eight?;question;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I could probably, um, I don't know. I-I guess, well, the big thing would be like kind of where I drink so like drinking like if I'm only like in my apartment so thenI'm not risking myself to drive or like if I- if I go out to a party waiting till, like, I'm 21 to drink. Um, maybe find stuff to do that doesn't revolve around drinking, like, I'm guessing like a town this size there's got to be more to do than just drink.;;change114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;In what ways might your life be better if you succeed in ;;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;"Um, I mean, I guess the big one would be like I won't- I won't be hungover all the time like I would make it to my 8:00 AMs then, well, even-even when I make it to my 8:00 AMs now like I just, I sleep like I wake up I'm like, ""Oh my god what's going on?"" And then I get to my 8:00 AM and I'll just sleep through and then miss just about everything that's on the test. So I think if I- if I reprioritize what is important to me, I probably help me succeed. I mean, in high school, I had a 3.5 GPA. So I know I could do it here.";;change114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;College is all about making choices. Can you tell me about your beliefs and values that influenced your decision-making and how do those beliefs and values align with the decisions you plan to make about drinking?;question;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Um, I mean education is really important to me and-and also my family. My parents are always talking about it and I really- I really wanna be an international journalist, to be on the news like, I mean, I have the face for it, um. So I guess if I reprioritize my- if I reprioritize what I need to do I and I won't drink so much. I probably wouldn't be disappointing my parents and I'd be able to get a really good education.;;change114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Thanks for coming in for participating today. Your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150.;therapist_input;114;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;All right, all right. When is the seminar?;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Okay, so why don't you have a rinse, David. How are you feeling?;question;115;low;smoking cessation;1;client;Okay.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Good. Here, take a look, see what you think. And that feeling-;other;115;low;smoking cessation;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;-and the color's okay? You know, there is quite a lot of staining so, um, I'm just wondering about, um, some concerns about smoking.;question;115;low;smoking cessation;5;client;Oh.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Possibly-;other;115;low;smoking cessation;7;client;Gonna get that again.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;-coffee, tea. Yeah, you've heard this before, I'm sure.;other;115;low;smoking cessation;9;client;I do all the above, yeah.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, you know, the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences. You know, physically, it affects dental caries, dental cavities-;therapist_input;115;low;smoking cessation;11;client;Yeah.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;-um, healing-;other;115;low;smoking cessation;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;in your mouth.;other;115;low;smoking cessation;15;client;Okay. Sure.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;So--;other;115;low;smoking cessation;17;client;I've heard it all. I-- but I just want to get my teeth fixed.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Yes, and I really want to be helpful. I really want to-- you know, my commitment is to your oral health, so um, there are lots of medications out there, David, that actually take away a lot of the cravings. They're-- they make quitting so much easier.;therapist_input;115;low;smoking cessation;19;client;I did a pill thing, so I did try it. So like, I did try try it. I just did the pills and they didn't work.;;sustain115;low;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;other;115;low;smoking cessation;21;client;It was a waste and it caused more side effects;;sustain115;low;smoking cessation;22;therapist;.No, it-- but David, it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about seven tries before they quit smoking, so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting, so--;therapist_input;115;low;smoking cessation;23;client;Or seven lectures along the road.;;sustain115;low;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Well, I don't think I'm giving you a lecture, that's certainly not what I meant. I--;other;115;low;smoking cessation;25;client;No. No, I just feel that way. I get really-- I get very defensive about when they bring-- cause I get it from my family doc, from my cardiologist, everybody. I'm like, I'm not a complete fool. I am for smoking, but—;;sustain115;low;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Well, there's-there's a reason that [crosstalk] people are concerned.;other;115;low;smoking cessation;27;client;-but it's not easy to quit.;;sustain115;low;smoking cessation;28;therapist;No. But as I said, these medications-- so you've tried the medication, you've been willing once.;therapist_input;115;low;smoking cessation;29;client;Yeah.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Then, can I write you a prescription for the medication? Can we talk about how you could use it? Because this is something that-that's very important. Not just for your overall physical health, for your oral health--;therapist_input;115;low;smoking cessation;31;client;I guess I got to really want to and-- things I've tried usually caused me more problems than they helped.;;sustain115;low;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Oh no, the smoking's going to cause you more problems than the-- than anything else. I can promise you that, David.;therapist_input;115;low;smoking cessation;33;client;Okay.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;34;therapist;The side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking.;therapist_input;115;low;smoking cessation;35;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral115;low;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Like, that's the, I think, thing to really consider.;other;115;low;smoking cessation;37;client;Okay. Well, can I go now?;;sustain115;low;smoking cessation;38;therapist;I'm-- okay, but you know--;other;115;low;smoking cessation;39;client;I-I-I know it, I know- I know, doc, what you're trying to-- but I just don't want to get into that right now.;;sustain115;low;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Okay.

I come back and like these rumors are going around about me. Like one time when I stayed home, supposedly, I was in the principal's office the whole day and I had security guards like escort me to classes which that was not true 'cause I was home the whole time.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;6;therapist;People like to make up stories.;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;7;client;I've been getting blamed ever since like fifth or sixth grade about with every single thing that's going on.;;sustain116;high;addressing bullying;8;therapist;For, like why do you think, wh-what kinds of-;question;116;high;addressing bullying;9;client;I think because the kids-- 'cause I like to nag on things. Like when people tell me things, I like to like talk more like with the person instead of just leaving it be, and I think the kids that like blame me for everything say that I'm an easy target to like hit, to like talk about, it's like annoying.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;10;therapist;So it's, uh, so when you were talking about like nagging on, tell me a little bit more about, can you give me an example of what you mean?;question;116;high;addressing bullying;11;client;"If somebody says like, ""Oh, I heard this thing about you."" I go, ""Oh, really, what is it,"" and I just keep talking and like make things worse.

I like stay there and like talk more.";;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;12;therapist;And-and what happens when you don't leave it be, what usually happens?;question;116;high;addressing bullying;13;client;"I think possibly more like talking more like it gets like bigger and bigger. It's just like if you stop it, then they don't know what to say, they-they're like, ""Oh, like she's walking away.""

That's-- that-- it's-it's really big unknown territory. Pressure High School class is probably 1,000 kids.;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;89;client;Yeah, 1,003.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;90;therapist;1,003 kids.;other;116;high;addressing bullying;91;client;And then there's the sophomores also that you have like another 1,000, so it's like—;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;92;therapist;-2;therapist_input;116;high;addressing bullying;93;client;Yeah.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;94;therapist;-potential enemies, friends, who knows which ones.;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;95;client;Yeah, with these like the first rumors had started going around about like my friend and I, and like I lost him just 'cause of rumors.

And so how else do you identify who your friends are that you can really trust who have your back?;question;116;high;addressing bullying;105;client;I say the ones that like not even that I've known the longest, but like the ones that actually hang out with me a lot, or like texting me a lot, or like calling. And the ones that are actually like that helped you before with like situations. And that they tell you stuff and they know they can trust you. Like one of my friends tells me everything about her. And like that's how I know she's a good friend 'cause she trusts me with things.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;106;therapist;You trust her back then?;question;116;high;addressing bullying;107;client;Yeah.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;108;therapist;Okay. Well, that makes a lot of sense that people-- it goes both ways.;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;109;client;Mm-hmm.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;110;therapist;You know. And, um-- So and for you, friends that, um, kind of, um, give you the attention that you'd like to have. Texting you-;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;111;client;Yeah.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;112;therapist;-calling and you hanging out with you, and stuff like that, rather than pretending to be a friend-;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;113;client;Mm-hmm.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;114;therapist;-when you know maybe they're gonna--;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;115;client;Yeah, that happens a lot with me with like a lot of friends. Like this one person like we've been friends since like-- Well, we were friends since fourth grade.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;116;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;116;high;addressing bullying;117;client;And like she just starts like lying and like just talking smack about me. And it's like, you're not a good friend then. Like I thought you were a friend since you've been my friend since our fourth grade.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;118;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;116;high;addressing bullying;119;client;And she just like causes a lot of drama now. And like she came- Like the friends I met at high school, she came like into them like, you're not gonna know-- In college, you're not gonna know who to follow 'cause-- since you keep following with my friends, what are you gonna do in college like not being able to find your own friends? It's kind of annoying 'cause they're my friends and like I can't be by her and she comes to my friends. It's like-;;change116;high;addressing bullying;120;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;116;high;addressing bullying;121;client;-get your own friends, [chuckles] stop following me.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;122;therapist;Mm-hmm. Wh-what don't you like about her?;question;116;high;addressing bullying;123;client;She just lies a lot and like just starts dramas about me and I haven't even talked to her like since eight grade. We only went to school together and she just like makes me lose other friends 'cause of the drama she starts;;change116;high;addressing bullying;124;therapist;Okay. So she sounds like she's, um--;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;125;client;A nobody. I'm gonna say that. She's like—;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;126;therapist;Or-or not worth your time.;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;127;client;Yeah.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;128;therapist;She's not worth your time. So what would it be like for you to really just spend time with the friends that you know are really--;question;116;high;addressing bullying;129;client;I do spend time with them. Like I hang out with them a lot.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;130;therapist;Good. That's really good. Yeah. And if-if you need like some extra support from them--;question;116;high;addressing bullying;131;client;Ask for it. Yeah.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;132;therapist;Right, and what kind of things do you ask from them?;question;116;high;addressing bullying;133;client;I just ask them like if I'm like gonna get like sent down to the principal's office for like something happening, I call them to come down to, like, support my, like, backup information.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;134;therapist;'Cause they can do that. They can- they can kinda give you some, uh, information like, uh, um-- they can give some accurate information, um, and back up your story versus the other person's story.;question;116;high;addressing bullying;135;client;Yeah.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;136;therapist;So, okay. So we're-- You know what? Um, it sounds like you actually have some pretty good ideas about, um, how to handle this, and yet kids are-- I know kids-- actually, adults can be really mean too. But, um, I know in high school, i-it's really bad.;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;137;client;Yeah.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;138;therapist;So I'm wondering if, um, uh, if-if you wanted to, we could get together again and continue to talk 'cause you-you've got some good ideas already. And I'm very open that if you wanted to bring any of your good friends in, that that would also be totally cool too.;therapist_input;116;high;addressing bullying;139;client;Yeah.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;140;therapist;So would that be something--;question;116;high;addressing bullying;141;client;Yeah, there's one friend that might wanna like talk about it.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;142;therapist;Yeah.;other;116;high;addressing bullying;143;client;And she's really like-- she doesn't know, like, who to talk 'cause her mom is not always there for her.;;change116;high;addressing bullying;144;therapist;Okay.;other;116;high;addressing bullying;145;client;And so like she's like doesn't know where to go.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;146;therapist;Yeah.;other;116;high;addressing bullying;147;client;Like she doesn't know who to believe.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;148;therapist;Well, I would want this session though to be for you though, Molly.;therapist_input;116;high;addressing bullying;149;client;Yeah.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;150;therapist;I mean I'm willing to see her too, you know.;therapist_input;116;high;addressing bullying;151;client;Yeah.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;152;therapist;It sounds like she really needs-- she'd like someone to listen to her.;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;153;client;Yeah.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;154;therapist;Yeah. So, um, we could maybe talk about some other ways of, um, helping, uh, deal with this because, um, it does sound like, um, people are, you know, just being plain old mean to you for no good darn reason.;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;155;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;156;therapist;Yeah. And, um, so you'd be willing to come back and talk about it then? Okay. All right. And I just wanna let you know that I think that you're, um, really doing a good job of-of, uh, dealing with how hard it is to be in high school, 'cause it is hard.;reflection;116;high;addressing bullying;157;client;Yeah.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;158;therapist;It is.;other;116;high;addressing bullying;159;client;I've noticed that.;;neutral116;high;addressing bullying;160;therapist;Yeah.

Um—;;neutral119;high;managing life;2;therapist;Wow, that's so great.;other;119;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah, but I wasn't able to go, um, cause my kids, I didn't have any one to watch them. And, um, you know, so the- that was sort of game over. I just, I had to cancel the interview and this, it's too bad because it was a really, a- actually was a job that would have been good, but I don't know.;;neutral119;high;managing life;4;therapist;You sound disappointed.;reflection;119;high;managing life;5;client;Well, yeah, because it's- it's, you know, I didn't really have a choice.

Well, tell me, um, on a scale from one to 10, how important is it for you to get a job?;question;119;high;managing life;9;client;Um, it sits about at a 10 because yeah, I mean, I'm the only one supporting my kids and, um, you know, it's just, what I'm getting from welfare is just not cutting it. So I really need to have a job and soon.;;change119;high;managing life;10;therapist;Yeah. You're-you're-you're it.;reflection;119;high;managing life;11;client;Yeah.;;neutral119;high;managing life;12;therapist;You have to provide for your children.;reflection;119;high;managing life;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral119;high;managing life;14;therapist;Um, and tell me on a scale from one to 10, how confident are you that you could get a job?;question;119;high;managing life;15;client;I mean, right now, I think I'm about at a three. I just seems like, you know, even if I'm able to get into the interview and get childcare, you know, when I show up, I've got this resume that it's- it's not impressive and it's got all these gaps of employment and I'm not as educated as other people going in for the same job. So I just feel like I'm not, um, I don't know, that employable.;;sustain119;high;managing life;16;therapist;So, it sounds like, you know, the childcare issue has been getting in the way, and so finding something that would work for you would be really helpful.;reflection;119;high;managing life;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral119;high;managing life;18;therapist;And then also it sounds like you're kinda feeling not so great about your resume and your experience.;reflection;119;high;managing life;19;client;Yeah. Yeah, because it's so limited and I've been out of the workforce and even when I was working, I mean, it's not, I don't know, it's not stuff that I feel like can lead to the job that I want now.;;sustain119;high;managing life;20;therapist;Okay. What is it that you- what is it that you want?;question;119;high;managing life;21;client;I just want something that is- is gonna be steady and where I can be, you know, even if my kids are in childcare during the day, that I can be home every night and spending time with them and, um, know you really like to get something where, um, I'm just making good money and- and I don't have to worry all the time about money.;;change119;high;managing life;22;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. So, if you had- if you had consistent work, it would change your life in a lot of ways.;reflection;119;high;managing life;23;client;Yeah. It would be huge.;;neutral119;high;managing life;24;therapist;Mm-hmm. It would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much.;reflection;119;high;managing life;25;client;Yeah. And it'd be nice to just know what I'm doing and just have my routine.;;change119;high;managing life;26;therapist;Right. So every day you know where you're going.;reflection;119;high;managing life;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral119;high;managing life;28;therapist;Okay. And you know, what's- what's happening for the- for the day, for the week.;reflection;119;high;managing life;29;client;Right. Well, it would be good if I knew, you know, that my kids are taken care of too-;;change119;high;managing life;30;therapist;Yeah.;other;119;high;managing life;31;client;- so I'm not worried about them while I'm at work.;;neutral119;high;managing life;32;therapist;Right. Yeah. Because you're- you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well.;reflection;119;high;managing life;33;client;Right.;;neutral119;high;managing life;34;therapist;Yeah. Um, so tell me, what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence, to feel a little bit more confident about getting work?;question;119;high;managing life;35;client;Well, I mean, being able to make the interviews would be the priority.;;change119;high;managing life;36;therapist;Okay, Yeah.;other;119;high;managing life;37;client;Um, so chi- you know, taking care, having some childcare, having-;;change119;high;managing life;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;119;high;managing life;39;client;- having someone I trust that I can call when I know I've got an interview.;;change119;high;managing life;40;therapist;Yeah. Because you definitely need to go to an interview in order to get the job.;reflection;119;high;managing life;41;client;Right. Yeah.;;neutral119;high;managing life;42;therapist;So having taken care of that part, having some reliable childcare would definitely help.;reflection;119;high;managing life;43;client;Yeah.;;neutral119;high;managing life;44;therapist;What else would get you to a five?;question;119;high;managing life;45;client;Um, I just wish that I had- I had more experience or, um, you know, more education. It seems like everyone's got a college education and I don't have that on my resume.;;change119;high;managing life;46;therapist;Okay.;other;119;high;managing life;47;client;I get asked about education and training and –;;neutral119;high;managing life;48;therapist;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.;other;119;high;managing life;49;client;- um, you know, I just, it, as soon as I asked about it, I just feel just like I'm not good enough-;;sustain119;high;managing life;50;therapist;Okay.;other;119;high;managing life;51;client;- since I don't have that.;;neutral119;high;managing life;52;therapist;Yeah, so if you had something on your resume that was around education training, maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in, that you would feel proud of yourself.;reflection;119;high;managing life;53;client;Yeah. Well, something I could talk about in the interview too. You know, even if I was some type of certification where I could say, I could, you know, with confidence talk about- about that.;;change119;high;managing life;54;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. What-- do you have any ideas as to what fields you might be interested in getting some more education, more training?;question;119;high;managing life;55;client;I mean, I guess, I just don't really know what it's gonna be because I need to have a job now so I'm not really sure.;;change119;high;managing life;56;therapist;Like what's going to be fastest.;reflection;119;high;managing life;57;client;Right. I almost feel like that's more important than what I'm interested in, you know, because I'm like, I'm not going to go back to school for four years right now.;;change119;high;managing life;58;therapist;Okay, and so if- if you were, it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd wanna to do something really quickly like a short- a short certificate.;reflection;119;high;managing life;59;client;Yeah or something-- yeah, something that I could get immediate skills that would, you know, get me into some kind of a job now, even if it's not my long-term goal or, you know, career just- just get me into something and then I can always focus on.;;change119;high;managing life;60;therapist;Yeah, sort of like a short-term or transition into something else.;reflection;119;high;managing life;61;client;Yeah. Great. Exactly.;;neutral119;high;managing life;62;therapist;But that would be steady and pays well?;reflection;119;high;managing life;63;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral119;high;managing life;64;therapist;Okay, and allow you to afford everything you need to afford.;reflection;119;high;managing life;65;client;Yeah, because even those jobs right now don't feel accessible for me. They seem like, you know-- seems like if-- maybe if I were better on the computer or you know.;;change119;high;managing life;66;therapist;Okay, so specifically getting some computer skills will help?;reflection;119;high;managing life;67;client;Yeah. I think so- I think so because I don't-- I can't-- I don't really have anything on my resume that talks about—;;neutral119;high;managing life;68;therapist;The technology.;reflection;119;high;managing life;69;client;Yeah.;;neutral119;high;managing life;70;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. So whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now and you really need the money and you really need to take care of your children and it sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one, and then once you're there at the interview, feeling more confident about your skills, um, getting some child-- reliable child care certainly sounds very important.;reflection;119;high;managing life;71;client;Yeah.;;neutral119;high;managing life;72;therapist;Um, as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers?;question;119;high;managing life;73;client;Yeah, that would be great.;;change119;high;managing life;74;therapist;Okay.;other;119;high;managing life;75;client;That would be great.;;neutral119;high;managing life;76;therapist;So what would you like to do next, you think?;question;119;high;managing life;77;client;Well, find the childcare resources-;;change119;high;managing life;78;therapist;Okay, okay.;other;119;high;managing life;79;client;- is- seems to be- that seems to be the—;;neutral119;high;managing life;80;therapist;That's a priority.;reflection;119;high;managing life;81;client;The priority 'cause I can't even do an interview without that.;;change119;high;managing life;82;therapist;Yeah.;other;119;high;managing life;83;client;And then, um, I mean-- I guess getting into some type of- some type of a training program that's, you know, short-;;change119;high;managing life;84;therapist;Yeah.;other;119;high;managing life;85;client;- like maybe there's a weekend, I mean—;;neutral120;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;Well, I'm glad we figured that out and I think you'll feel better over the next few days.;other;120;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Oh, thanks so much doctor. I'll just take it easy for a couple of days.;;neutral120;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;Well, since I have you here and we still have a few minutes left, I'd like to bring up another topic. I noticed that your blood pressure and your weight have been climbing a bit over the past few years. We haven't really had time to talk about this much before and I may be able to offer some useful strategies. Would it be okay if we discussed weight and health for a few minutes?;question;120;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Yeah, I suppose. I know my weight is a problem, but every time I try to take it off, I end up gaining it back. I don't know what to do.;;change120;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;I know how you feel. Managing weight can be frustrating. Maybe we can just start trying to figure it out together and I'll be here to help you through the challenges.;reflection;120;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;Okay, thank you doctor, but I'm just concerned about how I can possibly lose weight now since work is so busy and the kids take up so much of my time.;;sustain120;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;Yeah, that's certainly understandable. We both know that there's a lot that plays into weight management, but there's no need to figure it all out today, especially since things are so busy for you right now. Maybe we could put our heads together and think about something small that fits reasonably into your life and then we can take further steps when you're ready.;therapist_input;120;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;Okay, that sounds great. So, what should I do?;;neutral120;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Well, let's see. One of the things that's involved in managing weight and health is being active. Physical activity benefits the whole body. It's healthy for our joints, our stress levels, and especially for weight management. Perhaps we could talk about some ways of adding activity that fit into your life.;therapist_input;120;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;I knew you were gonna say that, but I don't have time in my schedule. I can't afford to take an hour to go to the gym every day.;;sustain120;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;Well, I understand that. I don't have an hour to go to the gym every day either, but one of the great things about physical activity is that any amount in any type of activity can be very helpful. For example, let's think about some activities that you enjoy doing.;therapist_input;120;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;I like to walk.;;change120;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;Me too. Walking is great exercise.;therapist_input;120;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;Wait a minute, isn't walking too mild to help you lose weight, though?;;sustain120;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;Actually, even just a few minutes of walking is really healthy and worthwhile, and then when you have time to do even more, that's great. Walking is also great because you can do it anywhere, it doesn't need to be at the gym.;therapist_input;120;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Oh, wow, that sounds good. You know what? Come to think of it, I have some time before I have to go back to work and I saw a nice park on the way over here, maybe I can take a short walk after this appointment.;;change120;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;That sounds great.;other;120;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;And you know what? I used to really love to dance, but I haven't done that in such a long time.;;change120;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Well, dancing is a great exercise, especially because it's fun.;therapist_input;120;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;Hmm. And I know my family would support me if I could just find some place where I can go dancing.;;change120;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;Oh, that's great to hear that your family is so supportive. And I bet there's a dance class somewhere around where you live or maybe even a dance fitness class at the gym.;reflection;120;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;Yeah, and you know what? I really like to try that.;;change120;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;Would you like to do some research on this and give it a shot?;therapist_input;120;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;Actually, I really would. I'm kind of excited about it. What else you got?;;change120;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;Well, small steps can go a long way. So, even things like taking the stairs instead of the elevator every once in a while or parking just a bit further from the door when you go to a store can be ways to increase movement in your day.;therapist_input;120;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;Mm-hmm. I can do that.;;change120;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;How about we start there and let's plan to follow up in a few weeks so we can see how it's going and then maybe talk about some other strategies that might help.;therapist_input;120;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;Diet, the D word.;;neutral120;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;Not necessarily. What we eat is certainly important for weight and health, but just like we did today, we can talk about some small steps that can fit into your life, and especially ones that you feel good about.;therapist_input;120;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;Yeah, I like that. Okay, I'll make an appointment and I'll start dancing right away, doc.;;change120;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;That's great. I'll see you soon;other;121;high;diabetes management;0;therapist;Uh, welcome. And, uh—;other;121;high;diabetes management;1;client;Thank you.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;2;therapist;I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;3;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;4;therapist;I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;5;client;From my GP?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;6;therapist;From your GP, yeah.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;7;client;Uh.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;8;therapist;But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.;other;121;high;diabetes management;9;client;What's led me to come here?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;10;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;11;client;My GP.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;12;therapist;And what did he have to say?;question;121;high;diabetes management;13;client;Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;14;therapist;mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;15;client;And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;16;therapist;Right.;other;121;high;diabetes management;17;client;Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;18;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;19;client;But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;20;therapist;Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;21;client;Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;22;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;23;client;But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;24;therapist;So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;26;therapist;"You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""";reflection;121;high;diabetes management;27;client;Mm, I'm very surprised.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;28;therapist;Mm. Came out of the blue for you?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;29;client;Yes. I think it did.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;30;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;31;client;Mm.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;32;therapist;And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;33;client;I-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;34;therapist;-you've been-been overweight with it.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;35;client;That's what I understand.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;36;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;37;client;You know, and I'm not overweight.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;38;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;39;client;I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;40;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;41;client;I don't know, really.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;42;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;43;client;My lifestyle—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;44;therapist;Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;45;client;No.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;46;therapist;your lifestyle?;question;121;high;diabetes management;47;client;No, not at all.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;48;therapist;Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?;question;121;high;diabetes management;49;client;Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;50;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;51;client;-you know, why you are-- Look around you.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;52;therapist;Mm, mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;53;client;um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;54;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;55;client;Right?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;56;therapist;He's got a lot to do.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;57;client;Um-- Absolutely right.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;58;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;59;client;He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;60;therapist;Right.;other;121;high;diabetes management;61;client;Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;62;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;63;client;Um—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;64;therapist;So how are you feel in your head-;question;121;high;diabetes management;65;client;I feel absolutely fine.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;66;therapist;-and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;67;client;Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;68;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;69;client;I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;70;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;71;client;I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;72;therapist;Hmm-hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;73;client;I sort of you know-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;74;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;75;client;- I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;76;therapist;Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;77;client;What is the problem?;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;78;therapist;And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;79;client;Well, uh, yes. I mean-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;80;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;81;client;-I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;82;therapist;Okay.;other;121;high;diabetes management;83;client;Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;84;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;85;client;And I don't know if it's hereditary.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;86;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;87;client;I think he said something about it being hereditary.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;88;therapist;So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;89;client;Yeah.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;90;therapist;maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;91;client;Yeah, it could be-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;92;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;93;client;-because, um, my mother mentioned-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;94;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;95;client;-that, uh, my father had diabetes-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;96;therapist;Right.;other;121;high;diabetes management;97;client;-diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;98;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;99;client;-uh, I haven't seen him for years.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;100;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;101;client;But he might well have it because he is-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;102;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;103;client;-a pretty cuddly guy. You know-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;104;therapist;Right.;other;121;high;diabetes management;105;client;He's pretty big.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;106;therapist;So he fits the picture-;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;107;client;Well, yes, the stereotype,-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;108;therapist;-when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;109;client;Yeah, I guess.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;110;therapist;A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;111;client;Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;112;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;113;client;-I don't know how many years.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;114;therapist;Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;115;client;Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.;;change121;high;diabetes management;116;therapist;Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;117;client;Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;118;therapist;That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;119;client;A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;120;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;121;client;-if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;122;therapist;Correct. Yeah.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;123;client;Also, it's—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;124;therapist;But it's not inevitable.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;125;client;Right. Okay.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;126;therapist;Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;127;client;I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;128;therapist;Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.;question;121;high;diabetes management;129;client;To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;130;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;131;client;Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;132;therapist;That makes a bit of sense.;other;121;high;diabetes management;133;client;And why go any further, it's there?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;134;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;135;client;Can't help it.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;136;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;137;client;They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;138;therapist;They managed with it.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;139;client;Relatives relatively went into their 70s.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;140;therapist;Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.;other;121;high;diabetes management;141;client;Well.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;142;therapist;If that would help.;other;121;high;diabetes management;143;client;If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;144;therapist;Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.;other;121;high;diabetes management;145;client;Okay.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;146;therapist;And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;147;client;I've heard of it yeah.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;148;therapist;So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;149;client;Right.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;150;therapist;All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;151;client;Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;152;therapist;You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;153;client;Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;154;therapist;That's right.;other;121;high;diabetes management;155;client;So insulin you-you.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;156;therapist;Kind of, as your.;other;121;high;diabetes management;157;client;You have yourself draws bar.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;158;therapist;Yap.;other;121;high;diabetes management;159;client;Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;160;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;161;client;Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;162;therapist;That's a good way to think.;other;121;high;diabetes management;163;client;Is that what happened?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;164;therapist;Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;165;client;Why?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;166;therapist;And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;167;client;Right. Okay.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;168;therapist;Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;169;client;You mean, personally?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;170;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;171;client;Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;172;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;173;client;As you get older.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;174;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;175;client;I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;176;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;177;client;At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;178;therapist;A slightly more sedate lifestyle.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;179;client;Yeah, absolutely. You just do.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;180;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;181;client;You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;182;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;183;client;"Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?";;neutral121;high;diabetes management;184;therapist;Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.;other;121;high;diabetes management;185;client;Yeah, I mean.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;186;therapist;What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.;question;121;high;diabetes management;187;client;Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;188;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;189;client;Um, I haven't noticed.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;190;therapist;Mh-hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;191;client;I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.;;change121;high;diabetes management;192;therapist;Okay.;other;121;high;diabetes management;193;client;If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.;;change121;high;diabetes management;194;therapist;So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;195;client;Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.;;change121;high;diabetes management;196;therapist;Yeah, Mh-hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;197;client;Um, more than I would normally.;;change121;high;diabetes management;198;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;199;client;But that would be, that would be about it.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;200;therapist;Mh-hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;201;client;Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;202;therapist;You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;203;client;Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;204;therapist;Mh-hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;205;client;Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;206;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;207;client;Um.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;208;therapist;Okay.;other;121;high;diabetes management;209;client;But maybe I-maybe I don't know.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;210;therapist;Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;211;client;I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;212;therapist;Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;213;client;Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;214;therapist;From your perspective, things are going well?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;215;client;"My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.";;sustain121;high;diabetes management;216;therapist;Yeah. It doesn't fit.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;217;client;And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;218;therapist;Mh-hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;219;client;And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;220;therapist;Right.;other;121;high;diabetes management;221;client;Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;222;therapist;Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;223;client;For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;224;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;225;client;Um.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;226;therapist;So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;227;client;Come on, you know.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;228;therapist;And you know that's a bit too-;other;121;high;diabetes management;229;client;Well, life is too short.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;230;therapist;Too much.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;231;client;You know it's the truth.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;232;therapist;Yeah. Okay.;other;121;high;diabetes management;233;client;I mean you know—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;234;therapist;And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?;question;121;high;diabetes management;235;client;Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;236;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;237;client;And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;238;therapist;Okay.;other;121;high;diabetes management;239;client;And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;240;therapist;Mh-hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;241;client;Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;242;therapist;So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;243;client;Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;244;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;245;client;Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;246;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;247;client;And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;248;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;249;client;"You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""";;neutral121;high;diabetes management;250;therapist;Hmm. Yeah, yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;251;client;"And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.";;change121;high;diabetes management;252;therapist;Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;253;client;Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;254;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;255;client;I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;256;therapist;And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;257;client;Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;258;therapist;Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;259;client;Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;260;therapist;Okay.;other;121;high;diabetes management;261;client;Maybe I'm just—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;262;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;263;client;You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;264;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;265;client;And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;266;therapist;Yeah.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;267;client;or Kentucky Fried or whatever.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;268;therapist;Very appealing, isn't it?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;269;client;You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;270;therapist;Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;271;client;So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;272;therapist;Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;273;client;Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;274;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;275;client;for ages.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;276;therapist;They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;277;client;Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;278;therapist;So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;279;client;Well—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;280;therapist;-when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?;question;121;high;diabetes management;281;client;Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.;;change121;high;diabetes management;282;therapist;Right.;other;121;high;diabetes management;283;client;I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—;;change121;high;diabetes management;284;therapist;You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;285;client;Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;286;therapist;You still run and have a cigarette?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;287;client;You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;288;therapist;Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;289;client;Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;290;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;291;client;That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;292;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;293;client;That was rugby and cricket was the same really.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;294;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;295;client;Um, but now—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;296;therapist;But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;297;client;"Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""";;change121;high;diabetes management;298;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;299;client;But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;300;therapist;Okay, so you meant to reduce.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;301;client;Yeah, yeah.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;302;therapist;You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;303;client;Yeah.;;change121;high;diabetes management;304;therapist;When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;305;client;Yeah, yeah. I sort of—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;306;therapist;So you've made our decision to do that?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;307;client;"it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.";;sustain121;high;diabetes management;308;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;309;client;It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;310;therapist;Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;311;client;Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;312;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;313;client;You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;314;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;315;client;"So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]";;change121;high;diabetes management;316;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;317;client;Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;318;therapist;But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?;question;121;high;diabetes management;319;client;Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;320;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;321;client;So we cut that down as I say.;;change121;high;diabetes management;322;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;323;client;But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;324;therapist;"You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.";reflection;121;high;diabetes management;325;client;"No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-";;neutral121;high;diabetes management;326;therapist;MIT.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;327;client;-warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.;;change121;high;diabetes management;328;therapist;Got to check out, why not?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;329;client;So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent;;change121;high;diabetes management;330;therapist;Hmm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;331;client;"-and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time.

And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;334;therapist;So everything else looked pretty good?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;335;client;My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.;;change121;high;diabetes management;336;therapist;Cholesterol good, your weight is good.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;337;client;Yeah-yeah.

I don't know.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;346;therapist;Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;347;client;So, yeah.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;348;therapist;And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;349;client;No.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;350;therapist;Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;351;client;I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;352;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;353;client;You shouldn't smoke.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;354;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;355;client;"And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize.""

This is- this is- this is so many people's lives.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;358;therapist;Mm-hm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;359;client;"And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.";;sustain121;high;diabetes management;360;therapist;A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;361;client;Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;362;therapist;Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;363;client;No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;364;therapist;Feel like you need to. Yeah.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;365;client;I mean, it's you know, why?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;366;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;367;client;Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;368;therapist;The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;369;client;So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-;;change121;high;diabetes management;370;therapist;I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;371;client;Is smoking related to diabetes then?;;change121;high;diabetes management;372;therapist;It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;373;client;Oh.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;374;therapist;So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;375;client;Don't help.;;change121;high;diabetes management;376;therapist;-isn't a good combination.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;377;client;Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a silly question. [laughs];;sustain121;high;diabetes management;378;therapist;Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?;question;121;high;diabetes management;379;client;Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.;;change121;high;diabetes management;380;therapist;Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;381;client;I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.;;change121;high;diabetes management;382;therapist;Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;383;client;Something of a rollover effect.;;change121;high;diabetes management;384;therapist;-rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;385;client;Domino effect, yeah.;;change121;high;diabetes management;386;therapist;"So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-";reflection;121;high;diabetes management;387;client;I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?;;change121;high;diabetes management;388;therapist;Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;389;client;Right.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;390;therapist;You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;391;client;Yeah.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;392;therapist;So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;393;client;Okay, so—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;394;therapist;So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;395;client;So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?;;change121;high;diabetes management;396;therapist;I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.;other;121;high;diabetes management;397;client;Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do.;;change121;high;diabetes management;398;therapist;Apples for breakfast.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;399;client;You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—;;change121;high;diabetes management;400;therapist;So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;401;client;Maybe.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;402;therapist;Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;403;client;Yeah.;;change121;high;diabetes management;404;therapist;And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;405;client;Yeah.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;406;therapist;Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?;question;121;high;diabetes management;407;client;Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;408;therapist;No.;other;121;high;diabetes management;409;client;So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates.;;change121;high;diabetes management;410;therapist;Yeah? You like the social aspect?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;411;client;I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a bar in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-;;change121;high;diabetes management;412;therapist;No, no, I get that. I get that.;other;121;high;diabetes management;413;client;-till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I—;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;414;therapist;So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;415;client;So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—;;change121;high;diabetes management;416;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;417;client;You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?;;change121;high;diabetes management;418;therapist;Haven't quite that-;other;121;high;diabetes management;419;client;And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;420;therapist;And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;421;client;And that gets me going. Yeah.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;422;therapist;And the sugar in it helps too.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;423;client;Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;424;therapist;So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;425;client;Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;426;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;427;client;if I find some social form of exercise, like squash.;;change121;high;diabetes management;428;therapist;And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;429;client;Yeah.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;430;therapist;And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;431;client;Yeah, and then—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;432;therapist;You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;433;client;"And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again.""";;change121;high;diabetes management;434;therapist;That sounds like a great plan.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;435;client;And so maybe that would, uh—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;436;therapist;Yeah, sounds like a good idea.;other;121;high;diabetes management;437;client;Maybe it's an idea. I mean—;;change121;high;diabetes management;438;therapist;I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;439;client;Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah.;;change121;high;diabetes management;440;therapist;Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?;question;121;high;diabetes management;441;client;"Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a bad idea this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path.";;change121;high;diabetes management;442;therapist;What's to lose? What's to gain?;question;121;high;diabetes management;443;client;Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?;;change121;high;diabetes management;444;therapist;It does make sense, yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;445;client;Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a—;;change121;high;diabetes management;446;therapist;So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;447;client;I'll talk to Billy about, um-- Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke.;;change121;high;diabetes management;448;therapist;Right.;other;121;high;diabetes management;449;client;I'll have a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.;;change121;high;diabetes management;450;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;451;client;Really.;;change121;high;diabetes management;452;therapist;So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;453;client;Yeah, I think that you say where-where you're at now, where you're going, where—;;change121;high;diabetes management;454;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;455;client;-and-and-and this is what I've got to do. I think I'm in a rut. I think that's where I've—;;change121;high;diabetes management;456;therapist;You've been stuck?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;457;client;I'm-I'm just-- I'm-I'm satisfiedly sort of contented, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, um, that my doctor has actually di-diagnosed me with diabetes 2-;;change121;high;diabetes management;458;therapist;Yeah?;other;121;high;diabetes management;459;client;-which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be managed.;;change121;high;diabetes management;460;therapist;Indeed, yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;461;client;Uh, maybe this is a blessing, actually-;;change121;high;diabetes management;462;therapist;So rather than--;other;121;high;diabetes management;463;client;"-because I think to myself, ""Well, if someday, I am diagnosed with diabetes, I'd just carry on and-""";;neutral121;high;diabetes management;464;therapist;Carrying on.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;465;client;"""-sitting in the corner of the bar, and chat, and talk and probably get fat."" I don't know, and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.";;neutral121;high;diabetes management;466;therapist;So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;467;client;Yeah, that's cool.;;change121;high;diabetes management;468;therapist;Maybe this is the-;other;121;high;diabetes management;469;client;That's really cool.;;change121;high;diabetes management;470;therapist;"-bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me.

Everything's fine.""";reflection;121;high;diabetes management;471;client;Mm.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;472;therapist;"But now you seem to be thinking looking and thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or aren't, as good as I thought they were.""";reflection;121;high;diabetes management;473;client;Yeah, I mean, I think you're quite right. I think you just—;;change121;high;diabetes management;474;therapist;Things could be better?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;475;client;I don't know, you become sedentary, don't you? No, it seems that-- No, actually, this is quite exciting. It quite [unintelligible 00:31:28];;change121;high;diabetes management;476;therapist;Yeah, I sense that. I sense that in you that you're--;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;477;client;"I think to myself, I think, ""Oh,"" I think go—";;change121;high;diabetes management;478;therapist;Quite invigorated with the idea of--;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;479;client;Yeah. I mean, this is- this is- this is cool, it's like an old challenge again.;;change121;high;diabetes management;480;therapist;Making some of these changes. Yeah.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;481;client;This is good. And, um—;;change121;high;diabetes management;482;therapist;You're up for the challenge?;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;483;client;"I think I am. I mean, I never thought about it, but when I think about it now it's, ""What am I doing here?"" Why am I like this? Why am I just happy contented to drift?";;change121;high;diabetes management;484;therapist;So think about when you were-- This-this is an interesting question to see what you think. You were- you were a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be a coach again.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;485;client;Yeah.;;change121;high;diabetes management;486;therapist;"What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying, ""Right--""";question;121;high;diabetes management;487;client;Oh, so if I was obs- if I was sort of-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;488;therapist;Yeah, what-what would you be saying?;question;121;high;diabetes management;489;client;observing as it were?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;490;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;491;client;Watching myself, what would I say?

I think, um-- And again, you put them together and it's-it's-it's becoming-- It's-it's a sort of a-an individual team job, isn't it really?;;change121;high;diabetes management;498;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;499;client;That, okay, do a bit of this and do a bit of that.;;change121;high;diabetes management;500;therapist;"Some good things I'm- some things I'm good at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--""";reflection;121;high;diabetes management;501;client;Yeah, but I don't have to give up anything really, do I?;;change121;high;diabetes management;502;therapist;It's not about giving up your personality or-;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;503;client;No.;;change121;high;diabetes management;504;therapist;changing who you are fundamentally.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;505;client;No it's not. It's not.;;change121;high;diabetes management;506;therapist;It's just tweaking things. Just fine-tuning a few areas and being a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit more, like the food choices or whatever. Well, Mike, I-I've really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your story a little bit, and it's helped me a lot to get an idea about where you're coming from, and a little bit about who you are, and what's happened in your past. And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some great ideas. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thing, and getting on working, and being busy, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this doctor tells you that you've got a problem.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;507;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;508;therapist;It comes along to me and talk today a bit about how you felt about that. Initially, it can be quite a bit of a-bit of a shock. It didn't quite fit with how you saw things.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;509;client;True, true.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;510;therapist;And as we've been talking, I'm hearing you're saying that maybe if you look back to where you were before you went to the doctor, things weren't quite that right, maybe. Things weren't as good as you thought they were.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;511;client;Now that I think about it- now that I think about it, maybe.;;change121;high;diabetes management;512;therapist;Yeah.;other;121;high;diabetes management;513;client;Maybe they were.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;514;therapist;And what I also hear you saying, it's possibly the-- It's now possibly more possible, in your mind, that you could make some of these changes, rather than bring broad-brush, you know, huge changes to your lifestyles. It's not about changing who you are, it's not changing huge facets of your life, but maybe small steps that need to be taken.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;515;client;Yeah, you see—;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;516;therapist;What you're kind of thinking about what those might.;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;517;client;Mm. When your life comes to a halt-;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;518;therapist;Mm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;519;client;-your family splits up, or whatever, and you don't have anymore, I-I think you stop caring really.

Yeah, that's a good idea.;;change121;high;diabetes management;534;therapist;Yeah. So, we've run out of time but I also want to ask you a final question, where to from here, what's next?;question;121;high;diabetes management;535;client;Oh right, well, wha-what we talked about.

Well, just to help you, because there's probably a lot of other questions you might have, other questions that might come up after this session.;other;121;high;diabetes management;569;client;Yeah.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;570;therapist;-before we go, I'd like to just-just give you a lot of- some information that might help-help you.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;571;client;Not too much.;;sustain121;high;diabetes management;572;therapist;Not too much, just some stuff that might just give you a little bit of background information on-;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;573;client;Yeah, yeah.;;change121;high;diabetes management;574;therapist;-some of the things that have-;other;121;high;diabetes management;575;client;Just give me a bit of background, really.;;change121;high;diabetes management;576;therapist;-around type- around Type II diabetes and some,-;other;121;high;diabetes management;577;client;Oh, yeah, and what it is-;;change121;high;diabetes management;578;therapist;[unintelligible 00:36:53] some of that.;other;121;high;diabetes management;579;client;-because I don't really know. Yeah, yeah.;;change121;high;diabetes management;580;therapist;Um, and I'd like to us- for us to meet again, so to catch up with you and make an appointment before you leave. Just to see how things are going and-;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;581;client;Okay.;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;582;therapist;-see what sort of little changes you've managed to make. I'd be really [unintelligible 00:37:07]-;reflection;121;high;diabetes management;583;client;Wha-what are we talking about, sort of few months down the line?;;change121;high;diabetes management;584;therapist;It's really up to you. Probably a little bit sooner would be good.;therapist_input;121;high;diabetes management;585;client;What, in about a month's time?;;neutral121;high;diabetes management;586;therapist;That'd be great.;other;121;high;diabetes management;587;client;Yeah, okay, I'm up for that.;;change121;high;diabetes management;588;therapist;How does that sound?;question;121;high;diabetes management;589;client;I'm up for that. Yeah, now-now that's putting me, um, that's very gently putting my head on the block;;change121;high;diabetes management;590;therapist;Because you don't know the timeline?;question;121;high;diabetes management;591;client;-and I don't mind that because, um, yeah, that's cool.;;change121;high;diabetes management;592;therapist;Mhm.;other;121;high;diabetes management;593;client;Yeah, yeah.

Thanks, Mike. [croostalk];other;121;high;diabetes management;597;client;And I appreciate it. Thank you.;;change122;high;unidentifiable;0;client;Well, I'm here because my mom wants me to be here.;;sustain122;high;unidentifiable;1;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;122;high;unidentifiable;2;client;I don't really wanna be here, but it-it-- whatever.;;sustain122;high;unidentifiable;3;therapist;Got it.;other;122;high;unidentifiable;4;client;Um, she-she found my stash-;;neutral122;high;unidentifiable;5;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;122;high;unidentifiable;6;client;-and she freaked out, and she's going crazy over it. Um, I don't why she was going through stuff in the first place, but whatever, so, now I'm here.;;neutral122;high;unidentifiable;7;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;122;high;unidentifiable;8;client;Um, I've been hanging out with a new cool crowd of people that I really like.;;sustain122;high;unidentifiable;9;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;122;high;unidentifiable;10;client;Uh, a-and-and that's-that's basically it.;;neutral122;high;unidentifiable;11;therapist;Yeah. So-so you've got this new group of friends and-and, um, you-you actually kind of like where you're at with things right now. And your mom was going through your stuff and found your stash, and it's just turned into a, you know, all of this.;reflection;122;high;unidentifiable;12;client;Yeah.;;neutral122;high;unidentifiable;13;therapist;Yeah.;reflection;122;high;unidentifiable;14;client;Yeah, basically.;;neutral122;high;unidentifiable;15;therapist;Yeah.;reflection;122;high;unidentifiable;16;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral122;high;unidentifiable;17;therapist;And, uh, sounds like you're-you're pretty upset with your mom for-for doing that?;reflection;122;high;unidentifiable;18;client;I am.;;neutral122;high;unidentifiable;19;therapist;Yeah.;reflection;122;high;unidentifiable;20;client;I mean, it's my stuff, I don't know why she's—;;sustain122;high;unidentifiable;21;therapist;Right. It's like your private place and, you know, it's-- that's-- it's your stuff.;reflection;122;high;unidentifiable;22;client;I-I don't go- I don't go through her s- I don't go through her stuff. I don't go through her purse. I don't—;;neutral122;high;unidentifiable;23;therapist;Yeah. So why should she go through yours?;reflection;122;high;unidentifiable;24;client;Right.;;neutral122;high;unidentifiable;25;therapist;Yeah. Yeah;other;123;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Okay, I finished the exam. I have some good news and I have some not-so-good news. Looks like you don't have any cavities, so that's the good news.;therapist_input;123;low;smoking cessation;1;client;That's great.;;neutral123;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;However, I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. Actually, if you look up here, the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so I'm just wondering what's going on.;therapist_input;123;low;smoking cessation;3;client;I don't smoke cigarettes.;;neutral123;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Okay. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation, in particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really definitely white-colored and there's little red spots. And you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth, but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called nicotinic stomatitis. And this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes, are you smoking a pipe or cigars? Or is there something else that could be contributing to this? Because I don't know what else might be causing it.;question;123;low;smoking cessation;5;client;Well, the only thing-- I've never smoked cigarettes ever, um, but, um, when, um, when I go out with my friends, um, we like to go to, you know, we like to go out to lounges.;;neutral123;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;123;low;smoking cessation;7;client;And, um, you know, sometimes they're those- those, uh, nice young men that gift you different sorts of things. And we got some of those mini cigars that are Swisher sweets, they come in peach and-and grape and-and, you know, that's the only time that really, you know, I've ever really used anything that-that's got tobacco in it.;;sustain123;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Okay, so I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit-flavored, people think they're okay. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?;question;123;low;smoking cessation;9;client;Really? Bad? But they're just little, mini, little, cute little girly cigars.;;sustain123;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Right. They're still cigars and they're still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema, all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarette, so it's really important.;therapist_input;123;low;smoking cessation;11;client;Well, I only use them just to relax. I mean, it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day, I mean, I only do it when we go out.;;sustain123;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Uh-huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that, so that's good, but it's still causing a lot of problems. And as I said, I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth, you're causing some serious damage, and this needs to stop. Have you thought about quitting?;question;123;low;smoking cessation;13;client;Well, I didn't really know I'd started.;;sustain123;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;What do you mean?;question;123;low;smoking cessation;15;client;I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking, just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars.;;sustain123;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;So you're gonna quit then?;question;123;low;smoking cessation;17;client;Uh, maybe.;;neutral123;low;smoking cessation;18;therapist;What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth, you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit.;therapist_input;123;low;smoking cessation;19;client;Well, it's something that I'll have to think about.;;neutral123;low;smoking cessation;20;therapist;What's there to think about? [chuckles] You said it's not that something you do all that often, and there's all these negative side effects, there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in.;therapist_input;123;low;smoking cessation;21;client;Well, it's just something that I do to relax, and I don't do it that often. And so I probably could cut back.;;change123;low;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Okay, well, that's a good start, but cutting back isn't going to do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from- from being at risk for these other diseases. But as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger.;therapist_input;123;low;smoking cessation;23;client;Well, I don't believe that they are cigars. And what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right, and it's something that I choose to do. And so I will think about cutting back, but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that. And I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real.;;sustain123;low;smoking cessation;24;therapist;You're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually, it can cause problems with your teeth too. I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use, whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chew, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die.;therapist_input;123;low;smoking cessation;25;client;Well, it's something that I'll think about.;;neutral123;low;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change.;therapist_input;125;high;unidentifiable;0;client;The baby was up all night and I'm exhausted.;;neutral125;high;unidentifiable;1;therapist;So, what you're saying is you've had a rough night?;reflection;125;high;unidentifiable;2;client;Yes. She was up every three hours to eat, I don't understand it.;;neutral125;high;unidentifiable;3;therapist;So, she needed to eat every three hours last night and that was really frustrating for you?;reflection;125;high;unidentifiable;4;client;Yes. My mom told me that I started sleeping through the night when I was a month old, Lilly is six weeks.;;neutral125;high;unidentifiable;5;therapist;Hmm. So, based on what your mom told you, you were expecting Lilly at this point to be sleeping through the night?;reflection;125;high;unidentifiable;6;client;Well, what is normal for a baby this age?;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hello, Kaylie. It looks like you're here to pick up a prescription today.;reflection;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Okay. It looks like cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take the medication?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;No, not really.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Well, you just take it once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;No.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;Well, some of the common ones are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe ones like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, just call your doctor.;therapist_input;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Okay. Um, why am I taking this medication?;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh yeah, just one tablet a day. Do you have any questions for me?;therapist_input;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;No, I guess not.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;All right. Great. Have a good day.;other;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;11;therapist;Hello, Kaylie. I see you're here to pick up a prescription today.;other;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;12;client;Yeah. My doctor said he called something in.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;13;therapist;Oh, it looks like he called in cholesterol statin. Do you know how you're supposed to take this medication?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;14;client;No, not really.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;15;therapist;Okay. Well, you take this one once a day. Did he tell you what side effects to expect?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;16;client;No.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;17;therapist;All right. Well, some of the common side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache. There are some severe side effects like dermatomyositis, liver failure, lupus, rhabdomyolysis, hemorrhagic, cerebral infarction. If you have any of those, you should call your doctor.;other;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;18;client;Okay. Um, so why am I taking this medication?;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;19;therapist;It's for your dyslipidemia. Oh, and you should take one every day. Do you have any questions for me?;therapist_input;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;20;client;I guess not.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;21;therapist;All right. Great. Well, have a good afternoon.;other;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;22;therapist;Hello, Kaylie, I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy. I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol statin 20 called in by Dr. Ferris today. I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me. I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it, and if you have any questions.;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;23;client;Sure. I'm just getting a few groceries.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;24;therapist;Okay. What did the doctor tell you cholesterol statin is for?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;25;client;Well, he told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol, and that I should start taking this.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;26;therapist;He's right. This medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol, and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. How did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?;reflection;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;27;client;He didn't really tell me. He just phoned it in.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;28;therapist;Okay. Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you normally take your medications?;therapist_input;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;29;client;Well, I take all of my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then.;;change126;low;adhering to medical procedure;30;therapist;Okay. That's perfect because cholesterol statin works best if it's taken at night, though you can take it any time of the day. And you should take it every single day. It's important to keep that up. Where do you store your medications?;therapist_input;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;31;client;I store my medications, uh, in my nightstand, right by my bed.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;32;therapist;All right. Do you have any children in your home?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;33;client;No.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;34;therapist;Okay. Well, then that sounds like a perfect location for you. Medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture. What did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;35;client;He didn't mention anything about that.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;36;therapist;All right. Well, this medication is pretty well tolerated, which means it doesn't have very many side effects. But you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains. If they seem really severe to you, then you should call Dr. Ferris and talk to him about that. Also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications, and even over the counter things. So check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new. And lastly, grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol statin 20. So if you use grapefruit juice every day, I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication.;therapist_input;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;37;therapist;Just so I know we're on the same page, can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;38;client;Sure. I'm just gonna take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications. And I guess I will switched to orange juice. And if I notice any muscle pain that is severe, I'll call Dr. Ferris right away.;;change126;low;adhering to medical procedure;39;therapist;Great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What other questions do you have for me?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;40;client;Uh, I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;41;therapist;Fantastic. All right. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every- at the same time every month. And if you have any other questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day.;therapist_input;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;42;therapist;Hello, Kaylie. I'm Lori, the pharmacist here at Bulldog Pharmacy.

Well, you're going to take one tablet of cholesterol statin 20 one time a day by mouth, and you can take that with or without food. When do you usually take your medications?;therapist_input;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;49;client;I take all my other medications right before I go to bed. So I guess I could take it then.;;change126;low;adhering to medical procedure;50;therapist;That's perfect. This medication can be taken any time of the day, but it does work best if taken in the evening, and it's important to take it every day.;therapist_input;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;51;therapist;Where do you store your medications?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;52;client;I store them all in the nightstand by my bed.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;53;therapist;Do you have children in your house?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;54;client;No. I don't have any kids.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;55;therapist;All right. So that sounds like a perfect place for you to store those. Medications are best when they're stored away from light, heat and moisture.;reflection;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;56;therapist;What did your doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;57;client;He didn't mention anything about that.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;58;therapist;All right.

I'm just gonna take one tablet of the cholesterol statin, uh, in the evening with all my other medications. And I guess I'll switch to orange juice. And if I notice any bad muscle pains, then I'll be sure to call Dr. Ferris right away.;;change126;low;adhering to medical procedure;61;therapist;That's great, Kaylie. I know we went over a lot today. What questions do you still have for me?;question;126;low;adhering to medical procedure;62;client;I think you answered all my questions. Thank you.;;neutral126;low;adhering to medical procedure;63;therapist;All right, good. Well, here's your prescription. I even put it on autofill for you so it'll be ready at the same time every month for you. And if you have any questions later, our phone number is right here on the bottle, and you can call me at any time. Thanks so much. Have a great day.;therapist_input;131;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Good morning. It's really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking.;other;131;low;smoking cessation;1;client;Good morning.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;What have you got in mind, what do you want from us?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;3;client;Well, I need some medication if you can offer me some.;;change131;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Absolutely, we're in the right place for that.;other;131;low;smoking cessation;5;client;And, uh, whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-free.;;change131;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Okay. Well, just remind me again why it is you want to stop.;question;131;low;smoking cessation;7;client;It's, uh, just these days-- I think these days I'm-I'm finding that, um, I'm smoking 20, 30 a day, I'm getting sick of it. It's, you know, I've seen my friends have stopped smoking too and it's kind of they're looking at me weird these days like I'm the only one left who's still smoking.;;change131;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;Oh, good, and so feeling under pressure here.;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;9;client;Especially the other night I was at the restaurant, it was a bit-- you know, it was a bit embarrassing I'm the only one walk walking out.;;change131;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;And so that-that can't feel a little uncomfortable being by yourself. So that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's a little getting smelly and it's getting embarrassing.;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;11;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Any other reasons?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;13;client;Um, it's expensive these days.;;change131;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;How much does it actually cost you a week?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;15;client;It's-it's about-- Um, I'll buy and go through a pack a day, so it's almost £7.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;£7 a week or a day?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;17;client;£7 a day today, so-;;change131;low;smoking cessation;18;therapist;So your pack a day—;other;131;low;smoking cessation;19;client;-you're talking about £40, uh—;;change131;low;smoking cessation;20;therapist;£50 a week.;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;21;client;£50 a week.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Even more mess, you see.;other;131;low;smoking cessation;23;client;Yeah.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Okay. So we're talking about spending £50 a week-;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;26;therapist;-being one of the few left smoking in your crowd, and not liking the smell. That sounds like three reasons.;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;27;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;29;client;Yeah.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;30;therapist;Great, okay. So have you got a date in mind when you'd like to stop smoking?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;31;client;Well, what you do-- What do you suggest?;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;32;therapist;Generally, it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains.;therapist_input;131;low;smoking cessation;33;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;34;therapist;What are the main reasons why you actually smoke? What do you enjoy most about it?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;35;client;Um, it's just entertainment. Something, um, when I bored, it's got-- I've got-- I smoke-;;sustain131;low;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;131;low;smoking cessation;37;client;-or sometimes I go out, but as I said, I'm the only one kind of outside.;;change131;low;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay. What do you think you'll miss most about it?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;39;client;The-- Um, it takes away a lot of my stresses.;;sustain131;low;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Mm-hmm, what sort of stresses?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;41;client;Just, uh, when I- when I go down, uh, for-for a break at work.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Mm-hmm.;question;131;low;smoking cessation;43;client;I never go down, I just need a break away from it all, just shut off. So, uh, I-I really enjoyed that. The cigarette just helps me calm down.;;sustain131;low;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Yeah. And what is your favorite cigarette of the day?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;45;client;It's definitely the one at the end of the evening.;;sustain131;low;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Okay, so the end of the day-;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;47;client;Yeah.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;48;therapist;-the thing that helps you just unwind, put an end to the work section and move into your own time.;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;49;client;Yeah.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;50;therapist;Okay. So after you've had the quit date, what do you think you might do when it it's the first day at work and it's time to go home if you're not gonna have a cigarette?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;51;client;I guess, um, I'll just- I'll just have, you know, some fresh air as well, but this time without a cigarette in my hand but to try and give myself regular breaks maybe, I don't know.;;change131;low;smoking cessation;52;therapist;Okay.;other;131;low;smoking cessation;53;client;It's one of those tough things.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;54;therapist;Have you managed to stop smoking in the past?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;55;client;I've managed for a couple of weeks.;;change131;low;smoking cessation;56;therapist;Okay. And what got you back?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;57;client;It was, um-- To be honest, it was stress from an argument with my partner I remember.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;58;therapist;So something just happened-;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;59;client;Yeah.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;60;therapist;-so it took you back into it. All right. Let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here. You really want to stop smoking because you're kind of the last guy in your group still smoking, it costs a lot of money, and you don't really like the sm;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;61;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;62;therapist;The main reason that you smoke is because, at the end of the day, it gives you a kind of relaxation, and if there's quite a little stress that's going on which you're using cigarettes to help you cope with.;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;63;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;64;therapist;What you'd like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of like choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible. When do you think would be a good time for you to choose to be your quit date?;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;65;client;I guess, um, at the weekend I've got a party coming up.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;66;therapist;Okay.;other;131;low;smoking cessation;67;client;So, uh, maybe Monday morning.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;68;therapist;So Monday morning after the party will be a good day, and that's next week. Okay. Now, one of the things that we do in the pharmacy is recommend that you use medication to help you. You know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely that can manage any cravings that come along. A lot of people like using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches, gum, you've probably seen people using any of these products. And other options are tablets which you can get from the GP.;therapist_input;131;low;smoking cessation;69;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;70;therapist;So, yeah, again-- Um, so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;71;client;Yeah. I'm thinking, um, one of these patches.;;change131;low;smoking cessation;72;therapist;Okay. So a patch is something you've already seen, and-;reflection;131;low;smoking cessation;73;client;Yeah.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;74;therapist;-and, again, I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like. This course of medication lasts for 10 to 12 weeks. And we strongly recommend that people stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success. Stop;therapist_input;131;low;smoking cessation;75;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;76;therapist;You've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work, which might be the first time you've gone without a cigarette. So, what I'd like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you're having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with. Often, a person who smokes knows exactly what it feels like when they're craving for a cigarette. What does it feel like to you, when you can't have a cigarette and you want one?;therapist_input;131;low;smoking cessation;77;client;I just get irritable.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;78;therapist;Okay.;other;131;low;smoking cessation;79;client;Yeah.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;80;therapist;And that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happening to you.;therapist_input;131;low;smoking cessation;81;client;Hmm.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;82;therapist;So, I would strongly recommend that you have the patch. I'll talk to you about how to use that and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation are coming up, particularly in that first week.;therapist_input;131;low;smoking cessation;83;client;Okay.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;84;therapist;So, you're happy with the date for [unintelligible 00:06:16]?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;85;client;Yeah, absolutely.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;86;therapist;Okay and would you like to come back and see me again?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;87;client;Well, definitely.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;88;therapist;And what would you like me to do if you don't come back?;question;131;low;smoking cessation;89;client;A nice phone call.;;neutral131;low;smoking cessation;90;therapist;I'd be very happy to do that.;therapist_input;132;high;diabetes management;0;therapist;Hello, again, Mr. Green. It's really nice to see you again. If you remember last week, we looked at your results here and you've got impaired glucose tolerance and you were a bit worried about type two diabetes, your blood pressure and your cholesterol are up a bit too. So today, we're meeting up to talk through some of the things that you could do for yourself that might improve the situation. And as you know, there's all sorts of things can affect your health. So can we just have a bit of a general chat, but how are you getting on?;reflection;132;high;diabetes management;1;client;Well, I suppose you're gonna give me a row and tell me it's all self-inflicted and I've got to change my ways and give up the things I enjoy.;;sustain132;high;diabetes management;2;therapist;Actually, I'm not going to do that because you're the boss. It's up to you what you want to do with you about your own health.;therapist_input;132;high;diabetes management;3;client;The doc said I've got to take pills for the rest of my life.;;neutral132;high;diabetes management;4;therapist;You don't seem too happy about that.;reflection;132;high;diabetes management;5;client;Well, I feel fine, but the-the doc said it could save my life.;;neutral132;high;diabetes management;6;therapist;Well, there's a lot of things you can do yourself that will improve the situation as well. So what we can do today is wee up some of those things, smoking, diet, exercise, weight, loss, all those kinds of things. So we're just gonna start and see how you feel as we go.;therapist_input;132;high;diabetes management;7;client;Okay, what should I do first?;;change132;high;diabetes management;8;therapist;Well, it's very much up to you, you're the boss of your own life. Where would you like to start?;question;132;high;diabetes management;9;client;Where do you think I should start?;;change132;high;diabetes management;10;therapist;Well, I could give you my opinion. Um, and I can give you lots of information, but I think you know the score pretty well. And I think you'd know what I would say.;therapist_input;132;high;diabetes management;11;client;Yeah, uh, you tell me, stop smoking and lose weight and take more exercise, wouldn’t you?;;neutral132;high;diabetes management;12;therapist;Absolutely. Spot on. So stopping smoking would have a huge impact, that would have a big impact very early on. Losing weight would also have a big impact because that would help with your blood pressure, your cholesterol, and also lower your diabetes risk. So what-what'd you think about those things? Uh,;question;132;high;diabetes management;13;client;Uh, I loved to lose weight but it's so hard giving up the things you enjoy.;;sustain132;high;diabetes management;14;therapist;It’s really tough. It's hard to know where to start, isn't it?;reflection;132;high;diabetes management;15;client;I really should do. Or shouldn't I,;;neutral132;high;diabetes management;16;therapist;How important is it for you then to lose weight?;question;132;high;diabetes management;17;client;Well, I'd like to see my children settled and my grandchildren growing up and I should,suppose I should be an example to them.;;change132;high;diabetes management;18;therapist;So can it be in there for your-your family's important to you?;question;132;high;diabetes management;19;client;Yes. I want to be there for them, but not a burden to them.;;change132;high;diabetes management;20;therapist;Yeah. So w-where do you think you can start with that?;question;132;high;diabetes management;21;client;Uh, I've been thinking about them a lot lately, and I want to be there for them. So have to do what I need to, to improve my health.;;change132;high;diabetes management;22;therapist;What's kind of the first thing you might think about doing?;question;132;high;diabetes management;23;client;You know, to start with, I could cut down on my drinking. Um, that's adding to my weight and to my blood pressure, isn't it?;;change132;high;diabetes management;24;therapist;Yeah. That would be a really good place to start, mm-hmm.;reflection;132;high;diabetes management;25;client;In fact, I think I'll try and cut out the booze altogether. My wife says I drink too much at the weekends.;;change132;high;diabetes management;26;therapist;So I think it should be really supportive of that then.;reflection;132;high;diabetes management;27;client;And I suppose I could cut out the crisps and pies at works.;;change132;high;diabetes management;28;therapist;So what would you do to make sure you didn't get hungry at work?;question;132;high;diabetes management;29;client;I'm gonna start having soup at lunchtime. I suppose a big bowl of soup would be far better than two pies.;;change132;high;diabetes management;30;therapist;Yeah. Well, a big bowl of vegetable soup. You could probably count that as one or maybe even two of your five a day. So it'd be a really good place to start. Anything else you could think about doing?;reflection;132;high;diabetes management;31;client;Well, there's one, one thing uh, I've done already, I've stopped adding salt to my food. The doc said that would help with my blood pressure.;;change132;high;diabetes management;32;therapist;Well, that's good. That's probably benefited you already. And the other thing you might not be aware of is that salt intake is linked to loss of calcium from our bones, which makes the bones more fragile. So reducing your salt intake will really help with that too.;therapist_input;132;high;diabetes management;33;client;Well, I didn't know that. Um, it's good to know. I'll tell my wife, um, she's still very fond of her salt and her mother had osteoporosis.;;change132;high;diabetes management;34;therapist;So well, maybe you can help her as well and that would be good. Well, I think you've got off to a really great start, Mr. Green. You're very well aware of what you-you need to do, and you've obviously thought about it and got some good plans in place. So you're going to reduce your-your alcohol intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake. Um, perhaps when we meet up next time we could talk a little bit about smoking and exercise as well, when you're ready for that. So how do you feel now?;reflection;132;high;diabetes management;35;client;I feel if I go ahead and do as I say with cutting down on the pies, the crisps, um, and cutting out the booze, I feel I'm making a start but let's take it a step at a time and see how it goes. But, uh, the next day when we look at it, the figures might be a lot better.;;change132;high;diabetes management;36;therapist;That's great. So should we meet up at the same time next week then?;question;132;high;diabetes management;37;client;Yes, that’s fine with me.;;neutral132;high;diabetes management;38;therapist;That’s great. All the very best then.;other;132;high;diabetes management;39;client;Thanks. You too.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;Mm.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;Mm.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;Okay.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;Yes.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;the expectation of life on the inside something?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;Yeah, it's worse.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;Yeah?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;Yeah.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;I haven't yet, I mean-;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;Okay.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;-the, uh, the offer's there.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;24;therapist;Yeah?;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;25;client;Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;26;therapist;Uh, tell me-;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;27;client;-it's there.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;28;therapist;It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;29;client;Yeah.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;30;therapist;You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;31;client;No.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;32;therapist;So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;33;client;How long have I been out?;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;34;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;35;client;Three weeks, one day.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;36;therapist;Three weeks, isn't it?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;37;client;Three weeks, one day.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;38;therapist;So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;39;client;I don't know.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;40;therapist;22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;41;client;Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;42;therapist;Okay.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;43;client;And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;44;therapist;Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;45;client;No, never lasts.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;46;therapist;Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;47;client;Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;48;therapist;Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;49;client;Yeah. And- [crosstalk];;change133;high;reducing recidivism;50;therapist;Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;51;client;-sort of opposite, yeah.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;52;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;53;client;You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;54;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;55;client;But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;56;therapist;Okay. Okay. So—;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;57;client;Do you have an idea?;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;58;therapist;No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;59;client;Mm.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;60;therapist;But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;61;client;Fiona?;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;62;therapist;Yeah?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;63;client;Yeah.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;64;therapist;Tell me about Fiona?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;65;client;She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;66;therapist;Okay.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;67;client;something.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;68;therapist;Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;69;client;12 years.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;70;therapist;12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;71;client;Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;72;therapist;Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;73;client;It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;74;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;75;client;Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;76;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;77;client;I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;78;therapist;Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;79;client;Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;80;therapist;Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;81;client;She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;82;therapist;She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;83;client;The one that, you know—;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;84;therapist;Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;85;client;Yeah, that's the one.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;86;therapist;Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;87;client;No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;88;therapist;Okay.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;89;client;Yeah.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;90;therapist;So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;91;client;If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;92;therapist;Sure, yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;93;client;And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;94;therapist;"All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?";question;133;high;reducing recidivism;95;client;"I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?";;change133;high;reducing recidivism;96;therapist;I know.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;97;client;Like if I'm not careful, I will be.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;98;therapist;Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;99;client;Yeah, certainly.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;100;therapist;Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;101;client;Yeah.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;102;therapist;Yeah?;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;103;client;Yeah.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;104;therapist;Yeah. And you're still with her?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;105;client;Yeah, yep.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;106;therapist;Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;107;client;You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;108;therapist;Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;109;client;A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense. Yeah, that's fair.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;110;therapist;Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;111;client;No, they are.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;112;therapist;Oh, yeah? Yeah?;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;113;client;I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;114;therapist;Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;115;client;Well, I don't know. I haven't got little, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got like this feeling that I should go somewhere.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;116;therapist;Okay. Yep. So a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;117;client;Yeah.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;118;therapist;It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;119;client;Yeah. No idea.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;120;therapist;No idea. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;121;client;[nods].;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;122;therapist;"Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. And-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""Time to move on"".";reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;123;client;Yeah. Well, um—;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;124;therapist;And now you've got—;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;125;client;Not many.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;126;therapist;Not many?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;127;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;128;therapist;But some.;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;129;client;Um, oh, I've got. Yeah, one. [chuckles];;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;130;therapist;One?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;131;client;One.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;132;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;133;client;Mm, yeah.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;134;therapist;Yeah?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;135;client;Okay, so, um—;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;136;therapist;Tell me something about that.;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;137;client;Well, he-he was- he was inside with me the first time I was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;138;therapist;Okay.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;139;client;So, he's the- he did it.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;140;therapist;He did it?;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;141;client;I don't know how the fuck he did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even a real addict, he was just-- Well, I mean, I don't know. He's very good with people.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;142;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;143;client;Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;144;therapist;Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more information about how he did it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship.;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;145;client;Yeah, but I can't ever be a drug counselor.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;146;therapist;No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-;therapist_input;133;high;reducing recidivism;147;client;Yeah.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;148;therapist;to a transition about being in a different place.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;149;client;Yeah. I think he would have found some higher power. They find-- I'm not gonna find one of them.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;150;therapist;Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;151;client;Yeah.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;152;therapist;So that might work for him, but what might work for you?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;153;client;I don't know. That's why I'm here.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;154;therapist;Sure.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;155;client;I don't know what that is.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;156;therapist;Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-;therapist_input;133;high;reducing recidivism;157;client;Okay.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;158;therapist;thing. whatever it is.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;159;client;Good luck.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;160;therapist;Well, it's a search, isn't it?;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;161;client;Yeah, I don't mean to be rude-;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;162;therapist;No.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;163;client;-but I do mean it's a big ask.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;164;therapist;Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;165;client;Fucking guts.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;166;therapist;Guts? Yeah?;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;167;client;Is it a quality?;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;168;therapist;I think it is.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;169;client;Yeah, I'd need some of them.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;170;therapist;Yeah?

Um, that takes guts. That takes courage.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;187;client;All right.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;188;therapist;In my view, it does.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;189;client;Okay.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;190;therapist;'Cause you could've come in here and said-;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;191;client;It's a bit awkward.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;192;therapist;"""Look, Ken, you know, I'll come in, report in, I'm outta here.""";other;133;high;reducing recidivism;193;client;Ah, yeah. I could've done that;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;194;therapist;You could've done that, but you're not. So I'm wondering what's different? 'Cause you may have done that in the past, I don't know, Daryl, with other people like me, but-but sounds like something's different this time.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;195;client;I'm older, you know? It's not as much fun.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;196;therapist;Yeah?;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;197;client;I used to take the piss outta you guys-;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;198;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;199;client;-all day long.

I mean, in fact, you don't deserve my shit. I just-- I don't know. Good luck.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;202;therapist;I kind of see a sense of sadness there when you have to kind of think about this.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;203;client;Oh, sadness. You know, I don't wanna wallow, you know? You know, you've gotta take, you know-- You make your own opportunity in life, don't you?;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;204;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;205;client;I just never did.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;206;therapist;Okay.

Not to me.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;210;therapist;Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;211;client;Oh, yeah. Oh, heaps of those opportunities.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;212;therapist;And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;213;client;Yeah, well, the different world isn't offering me opportunities. The different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. So it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you know, old behaviors.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;214;therapist;Sure, sure.

It is really hard.;therapist_input;133;high;reducing recidivism;239;client;I know that's the right thing, uh, don't get me wrong.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;240;therapist;Sure.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;241;client;That is gut right there, going to a job you hate, going home, cooking yet missus a dinner, looking after your kids. I mean, that is-- That's what it real mean does, but I don't have that-- Th-those guts to do- to do what you do.;;sustain133;high;reducing recidivism;242;therapist;Sure. We talked about courage before and you've got the guts to be talking with me about this stuff today, and I'm wondering if you actually do have some courage to think about these ideas. I'm not saying that pumping gas at minimum wage is where you wanna go, but-but the guts to actually start steeping into this other world. I wonder if you do have, I'm-I'm-I'm just not sure.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;243;client;I-- Hmm, maybe.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;244;therapist;Maybe. You're not convinced at the moment, I understand that and, um—;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;245;client;No. You know, convince me because, you know, I kind of want to be.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;246;therapist;Sure.

Because it is new, it's different. It means doing stuff, a lot of stuff actually that-that's kind of mundane.;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;251;client;It is the little things, yeah, like waking up, and having a cup of tea and sitting on the porch is kind of cool.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;252;therapist;It's kind of cool?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;253;client;Yeah.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;254;therapist;Not part of on the wire?;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;255;client;No, you don't get to sit outside-;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;256;therapist;No?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;257;client;on the porch.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;258;therapist;You don't.

If it was full of bits like that, sure, but I mean, you know, eventually you have to go off to your job and-;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;266;therapist;Yeah?;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;267;client;-you know, pay your-your wages, I mean your-your mortgage and-and-;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;268;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;269;client;-it's just massive.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;270;therapist;Yeah it is. It is.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;271;client;It is.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;272;therapist;Absolutely massive. And, uh-- So, is there a challenge you're up to, to start creating some-some-some of that sort of world for Fiona? 'Cause I'm hearing that—;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;273;client;You know, people like me are unaccepted into that world though. You know? I've got-- I don't have qualifications. All my mates are in Australia working awesome jobs, mining for 160K a year, you know? Just being men digging holes.

No time at all, I'd say for about 10 hours with you.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;316;therapist;Okay-okay, so the fact we're even having a conversation about it, it's kind of interesting?;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;317;client;Yeah.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;318;therapist;Yeah, so I wanna summarize, Daryl, what-what I picked up so far and then just so I make sure I'm really listening to you well 'cause it's important, isn't it? 'Cause, you know, it's important you're listened to-;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;319;client;Mm.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;320;therapist;-by people me. So what I'm picking up is-is-is that if you've-you've got this long 12-year history, you can make some big money or you can dealing, doing crime, that stuff, I'm-I'm picking up that Fiona's set the bottom line, is if you go back in that lif;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;321;client;Yeah, 12, nearly 13.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;322;therapist;Nearly 13 years, so and-and so-so she stuck with you, and I'm pick up that's important to you, um, and-and-and yet you talk about it, it just seems easy, this bit over here, this whole lifestyle.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;323;client;Mm.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;324;therapist;This other lifestyle over here though when we talk about, actually thinking about, you know, doing stuff, doing the stuff that-that everybody else generally does, [unintelligible 00:22:30] will gets on doing, it doesn't have that same kinda seem to excitement, and it doesn't seem to be a-a starting point for you over here.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;325;client;Uh, that it-it does kinda seem exciting.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;326;therapist;Oh, it does?;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;327;client;It does, because it's so different.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;328;therapist;Right, okay.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;329;client;And I'm kinda over that one.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;330;therapist;Okay, you're over that one, okay.

You seem a little surprised, I'm-I'm [crosstalk] wondering about, surprising face.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;343;client;You-you know, it was a long time ago that we were inside. I just know that's what he's doing. It would be pretty odd calling but the- he'd probably be okay with it.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;344;therapist;So possibility to call?;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;345;client;Possibility to call yeah.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;346;therapist;Yeah there's possible.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;347;client;Yeah.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;348;therapist;Yeah, okay, and Fiona's been pretty staunch.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;349;client;Mm.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;350;therapist;Is someone who actually who has some pretty clear ideas about where she wants you as a couple to go-;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;351;client;Mm.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;352;therapist;I get a sense.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;353;client;Yeah.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;354;therapist;Yeah.;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;355;client;Well, I just have to do what I'm told. I don't know.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;356;therapist;Yeah, but I'm picking up though behind that doing what you're told, she's got some hopes.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;357;client;Oh, yeah, I was being, um, chipping, I mean, yeah she has more hopes than me, you know.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;358;therapist;So what will it take for you to start thinking about some of her hopes and sharing some of her hopes?;question;133;high;reducing recidivism;359;client;Um, like I do- I do but what it would take, you know, I mean, that's pretty freaking scary shit.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;360;therapist;Yeah?;other;133;high;reducing recidivism;361;client;Yeah. And I would never admit to that.;;neutral133;high;reducing recidivism;362;therapist;You said before you're sort of guy that once you make a decision you're pretty staunch with that decision.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;363;client;Yeah.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;364;therapist;So if you made a decision to go there, it might be a scary as shit but again it seems that, uh, it could work if see it look, this is important, this relationship's important, let me go for—;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;365;client;Yeah, but my-when I made my decision to not do that yet like I was very clear I understood I know that picture.

Here's someone that actually has made a different decision then, uh, it sounds like that's the pathway that starts over here and I'm wondering. I wonder whether you might have wisdom about what it's like to t-to tread that path.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;369;client;Yeah, like, I guess I could be wondering that too.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;370;therapist;So you know there's a part of you going, I was thinking in this place that's hard work.;reflection;133;high;reducing recidivism;371;client;Hmm.;;change133;high;reducing recidivism;372;therapist;And this is a pretty lonely road to-to walk by yourself.
