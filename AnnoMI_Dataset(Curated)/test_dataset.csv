118;low;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hi, come in. [door closes] Sit- sit yourself down. Uh, what can I do for you today?;question;
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Well, I've got myself all worked up now I've been sat outside.;;neutral
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Okay.;other;
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;I'm not-- I'm now late. I'm sorry. Um, I've come to see you because I've got a really sore throat. It's been like this for a good few days, um, and I think I need some more antibiotics.;;neutral
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;All right. Um, okay. Um, well let's, uh, let's just have a look shall we? See what's going on. You just wanna open your mouth for me. Say ah.;therapist_input;
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Ah.;;neutral
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;Okay. Right. Uh, to be honest, you know, looking there, it just looks like one of those viruses that are going around at the moment that are causing these sore throats. So, uh, I think that we should just perhaps go for a bit of paracetamol and, uh, some fluids and let nature sort it out.;therapist_input;
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;I've been sat here for half an hour. Do you not want to know a little bit more about it, or? I mean, it- it's really painful. I- I've barely been able to swallow today and I'm so worried about passing things on to the kids. Um—;;neutral
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;Well, I mean, I'm sorry we're a bit late, but you know that's the general practice, isn't it? You know, sometimes these things happen. Um, but it doesn't alter the fact that you do just have a virus, uh, and they are very common. And the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids, and the paracetamol will help the pain. Um, with giving it to the kids, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that. It's unlikely they'll get it, but I can't guarantee it.;therapist_input;
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;[sighs] Well, I mean, this is gonna affect my job. I talk on the phone quite a lot at work, and I'm just-- I don't think at the moment I'm going to be able to go to work. Can- can I, at least, get a sick note?;;sustain
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Uh, well- well, not really. Uh, you need to self-certify in your first seven days off sick so if you're going to take some time off, just take some paracetamol, lots of fluids, get a self-certified note, uh, in to your employer, and put sore throat there.;therapist_input;
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;Well, I don't think my employer are gonna take that. I mean, they- they've given us so much hassle at things in the past. I mean, can- can I get a private note? Can- can I ask you to write me a letter, at least?;;neutral
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;Uh, well, obviously that's a non-NHS thing so we have to charge you for that and our going rate for that is, uh, £12.;therapist_input;
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;Just- it's just not good enough. I just-- [sighs];;neutral
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;Oh, I'm sorry. But, you know, if you have just got a sore throat, then there's not much I can do about that. It's just, you know, something that we all get from time to time. Perhaps, what you really need to do is, uh, you know, just take some paracetamol and get some fluids.;therapist_input;
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;Parace- paracetamol. Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be for me? I mean, I could lose my job or something.;;neutral
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;16;therapist;Okay, that's pretty unlikely with sore throat. I think that's so, you know, a little bit of grand staging there.;therapist_input;
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;17;client;I'm sorry, uh, I think I'm gonna say something that I don't- I don't want to, so I'm actually going to go.;;neutral
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;18;therapist;Okay.;other;
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;19;client;Thank you.;;neutral
118;low;adhering to medical procedure;20;therapist;Bye.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;So, we were, um- we were just talking a little bit about sustained talk, which most people call denial.;therapist_input;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Well, I'm glad I don't have any of that.[laughter];;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;You're a lucky man.;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Thank you.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;"So, um, it also, um-- Anyway, it's-it's when people are just saying, ""Um, you know, this is why I don't wanna change. You know, I'm happy the way that I am. You know, it's, you know, um, God made it that marijuana stuff,"" you know, things like that. So-";therapist_input;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Yeah, okay.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;-so, you're gonna, um, play with me a little bit and, um-;therapist_input;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Yeah.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;-and you're gonna—;therapist_input;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Well, you were asking me why I don't like to take my medicine.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Right. So, you're-you're a, um-um, a patient who's been diagnosed with some s- maybe schizophrenia, bipolar.;therapist_input;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;I like to call it mild schizophrenia.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;Okay, mild schizophrenia is fine. Good. Okay, so-;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;And-and-and, uh—;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;just a touch.E42;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;Yeah, just a little schizophrenia. I'm-I'm-- But, I'm okay with it, and so am I.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;therapist;Okay. [laughs] And-and-and, uh, if you wanted to maybe even, you know, a little drinking and weed in there 'cause it's also very kind. [crosstalk];other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;client;Oh, that makes me f-- Yeah, that makes me feel-;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;therapist;Okay.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;19;client;relaxed.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;20;therapist;Yeah.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;21;client;I need that.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;22;therapist;Yeah.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;23;client;Um-;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;24;therapist;Okay.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;25;client;-I gotta be relaxed, you know-;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;26;therapist;Yeah.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;27;client;-if-if you had, you know- if you had to ride around in the back of a garbage truck all day like I do-;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;28;therapist;Yeah.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;29;client;-uh, it's, uh- it's stressful, you know. [clears throat] But, the doctor- you know, the other doctor put me on this medicine and-and I gotta take it every day. And, I-I don't like it. Uh, I'll just be honest with you, I don't like it.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;30;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;31;client;It doesn't-- I don't like the way it makes you feel, um, I don't like the way it makes me act, and it's taken my sex drive, and just thrown it at the back of the garbage truck.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;32;therapist;Well, that is a bummer. I mean—;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;33;client;It is.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;34;therapist;So you said the-the first one you said, you don't like the way it makes you feel?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;35;client;Right.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;36;therapist;So, tell me a little bit about what you don't like about- what you've noticed about it?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;37;client;Well, i-it's kinda like I'm in kind of a dreamy world. I-it kind of, I don't know, i-it just seems like I'm kinda like living in the middle of a cotton ball or something like that, where just things are kinda soft and, I don't know, I-- It just, the-the spice of life doesn't seem to be there. It seems like everything's bland, and nothing really-- Food doesn't taste the same, and things don't smell right, and—;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;38;therapist;Very dull.;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;39;client;Very dull.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;40;therapist;Very dull.;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;41;client;Very dull.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;42;therapist;Yeah.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;43;client;That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;44;therapist;Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;45;client;Well, I feel like it's taken part of my personality and just thrown it away. I don't really feel like I'm all there, right. You know, like, um, I like to be spontaneous and funny, and-and all that night, and I- and I don't-- You know, by the time I come up with a-a funny remark to the situation, everybody's left the room, and-[laughter]-stuff like that. And-and-- [chuckles];;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;46;therapist;It's really, your timing is [unintelligible 00:03:13];reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;47;client;Absolutely.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;48;therapist;So you feel slow.;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;49;client;And so, as you can can tell, I didn't take my medication today, I'm-I'm-I'm really on my game today. So.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;50;therapist;So, it's, you know, thinking as quickly and responding as quickly and-and things like that-- [crosstalk];reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;51;client;More like takes the edge off-;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;52;therapist;Yeah.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;53;client;for sure.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;54;therapist;Yeah.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;55;client;Well, you understand that.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;56;therapist;Yeah.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;57;client;You-you can- you can understand why I don't take it.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;58;therapist;To tell you, it sounds terrible, actually. Yeah. So, that that-that really-- And then- and then, to top it all off, literally, I mean, no sex drive.;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;59;client;Right-right.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;60;therapist;And-and your wife, what does she have to say about that?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;61;client;Well, she wants to know who I am and what did I do with her husband.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;62;therapist;Yeah. Where's Scott? Where did- where did Scott go? That feisty, spirited guy, where- where'd he go?;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;63;client;Yeah.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;64;therapist;With the libido out the door.;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;65;client;Yeah. And, uh- and so, she-- Actually, she-- When I first went on the medicine, she thought I was maybe messing around with somebody else, 'cause, I-I just wasn't interested in it at all.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;66;therapist;Oh, okay.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;67;client;I canceled my subscription to the spice channel.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;68;therapist;I didn't even know they had a spice channel. [chuckles];other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;69;client;I don't know if they still have it or not. [chuckles];;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;70;therapist;"So they-- So, um, before you started taking the medication, though, when she was, you know, um-- Even though now she's like, ""Where is my old Scott,"" and stuff, well, were there any times when she wanted you to go on the medication? And, if so, what-what prompted those?";question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;71;client;Well, if I stay off the medication too long, I-- Some people might say there's a problem with that, you know.;;change
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;72;therapist;You were right.;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;73;client;Well, I guess running around the neighborhood with no clothes on isn't really good.;;change
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;74;therapist;Okay.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;75;client;Um, I thought I had a, uh—;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;76;therapist;Might get you into trouble [unintelligible 00:05:06];reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;77;client;Yeah, well, I thought I had my gym shorts on, but they said that I didn't.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;78;therapist;Okay. What else?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;79;client;Well, I-I ended up in the hospital.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;80;therapist;What do you think about the hospital?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;81;client;Don't like that hospital.;;change
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;82;therapist;No.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;83;client;Uh. [clears throat] I'm not sure that the hospital is worse than the cotton ball, but I don't like it either.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;84;therapist;So, you'd really like to stay out of that hospital?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;85;client;Well, I got a question for you. You're a doctor, why don't you guys come up with some- something else besides either being in the hospital or taking this stuff every day, can you come up with something? I mean, you guys, we put a man on the moon 50 years ago, I mean, and you still got to give me this stuff that makes me feel like a-a zombie with-- That hasn't had a drink or water in four days, it-it just doesn't seem right. Either you guys ought to come up with something better. That's what I think.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;86;therapist;I agree with you, I really do. So-- And I- and I think that a lot of times, um, the medications, they do have a lot of side effects, and I completely understand why people don't wanna take them-;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;87;client;Yeah.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;88;therapist;Yet, at the same time, I know running around and getting in trouble for being naked or having to go to the hospital, not such a good thing either. Um, I'm wondering if, um- if I could run some ideas by you that some other patients of mine have tried?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;89;client;I suppose.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;90;therapist;Okay, thanks. Um, we could if you're-- 'Cause, as you can tell, this is really more of an art than a science, um, try some other medications and see how you do on them, and perhaps, you won't have these side effects. And, um, it-it really is just a matter of kind of experimenting around to get, uh, to see if we can get to a point that at least you're not having these really bad things happen of getting into the hospital and getting arrested and stuff versus feeling more like that-that spirited Scott that, you know, watches Spice channel, you know, I mean-- Because I can tell the spirit of Scott is, uh, a hoot.;therapist_input;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;91;client;Well. Yeah. Well, yeah, I-I'd like to. I don't know, is it-- Can you- can you drink with them, some of these other ones?;;change
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;92;therapist;Well, you know, uh, Scott, well, tell me a little bit since you brought that up. Yeah, obviously, drink and tell me a little bit about your [unintelligible 00:07:35];question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;93;client;Well, I don't really drink like people-- Like some alcoholic or something but, I do—;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;94;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;95;client;I-I like to take the edge off-;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;96;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;97;client;You know, with a few drinks, you know, not-not a lot, you know, and-and really-;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;98;therapist;How-how often do you do that?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;99;client;Not every day.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;100;therapist;Maybe every other day?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;101;client;Maybe.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;102;therapist;Okay.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;103;client;Maybe not, uh-;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;104;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;105;client;You know, it's not all the time, it's-it's not- it's not a problem.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;106;therapist;Okay.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;107;client;Certainly not a problem.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;108;therapist;How would you know if it was a problem?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;109;client;Well, if I was like getting arrested for drunk driving.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;110;therapist;So, if you got a DUI, you would really know.;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;111;client;Well, that's what alcoholics do. I'm not an alcoholic.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;112;therapist;Okay.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;113;client;Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.;;sustain
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;114;therapist;Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.;therapist_input;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;115;client;Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.;;change
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;116;therapist;Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;117;client;I get edgy.;;change
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;118;therapist;Yeah.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;119;client;I-I-I get edgy.;;change
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;120;therapist;Yeah. And you don't like that?;question;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;121;client;No-no. I'd-I'd like to just be normal as well. I'd real-- I'd like to just be normal where I don't have to take medicine, and I don't end up in the hospital three times a year, and I don't find myself in the neighbor's yard—;;change
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;122;therapist;Running around naked.;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;123;client;With a statue. It's—;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;124;therapist;Okay.;other;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;125;client;They were really ticked about that statue thing this time, and I don't know why I keep going back over there, but—;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;126;therapist;You must like that statue.;reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;127;client;I really don't, but, apparently, when I'm in that state, uh, there's something about it, I'm not sure.;;neutral
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;128;therapist;So, if-if-if we could maybe find a medication that didn't give you as bad side effects, perhaps you might not have to drink as much or at all or smoke a little weed to take the edge off. I mean, who knows? [unintelligible 00:09:55];reflection;
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;129;client;Well, maybe. I-I-I guess that's possible.;;change
85;high;adhering to medical procedure;130;therapist;Yeah.;other;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;0;therapist;Hi Mr. Johnson?;question;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;1;client;Hey.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;2;therapist;Hi, I'm Tonny Brownie, I'm a pharmacist here, uh, and I- and I was wanting to spend just a little time with you talking to you about your cholesterol. I found out you're newly diagnosed and your medicine for your cholesterol.;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;3;client;Yeah, my doctor talked to me about my cholesterol, that-that's-that's his job.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;4;therapist;Okay, certainly glad to hear that your doctor did spend some time with you, um, I-I see myself as somebody who works with your doctor, uh, to help you get the most benefit from your medicine, uh, because you are gonna spend money on it we wanna make sure that you get the most benefit from it. Uh, also sometimes it may be difficult to reach your doctor we're also here, uh, and so we try to work together, wo-would that be okay?;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;5;client;Yeah, that'd be okay, yeah, you know, I'm not so certain I'm even gonna take the medicine cause, you know, he mentioned muscle weakness, uh, you know, I-I know I got high cholesterol, uh, and that I'm running the risk of stroke and heart attack down line but yeah, he mentioned muscle weakness and I've been thinking about that and, uh, you know I'm a truck driver and I got a haul the heavy boxes out of the truck on a dolly, and I can't afford that right now. Just that-that muscle weakness, uh, that-that bothers me.;;sustain
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;6;therapist;So-so on the one hand, the doctor talked to you about high cholesterol, down the line possibly causing a stroke or heart attack-;reflection;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;7;client;Oh, yeah.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;8;therapist;-and that would be pretty serious. On the other hand, uh, when you found out that this drug might cause muscle weakness, that really alarmed you.;reflection;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;9;client;Yeah, that's the problem, that's what I face now with my job.;;sustain
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;10;therapist;Especially with your job and-;reflection;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;11;client;Yeah.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;12;therapist;preventing you from doing your livelihood.;reflection;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;sustain
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;14;therapist;Okay, um, would you mind if I talk to you, if-if I- if I gave you a little bit of information about the muscle weakness, and you tell me what you think?;question;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;15;client;That'd be fine.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;16;therapist;Okay. The muscle weakness with this drug is very rare, uh, usually doesn't even happen, okay? Uh, if it happens it usually happens within the first month of taking the medicine, you'll notice it in terms of weakness in the arms, uh, or some muscle pain, it's not usual. If this should happen, uh, if you let the doctor or me know right away, we can get you off the medicine, it's completely reversible. It's, the muscle weakness will go away within a couple of days, right.;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;17;client;Oh.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;18;therapist;Now, you don't wanna let that go on for months at a time, that's when it can become serious.;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;19;client;Okay.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;20;therapist;But otherwise, again it's rare, and it's completely reversible if you let us know.;other;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;21;client;Well, I guess it doesn't worry me quite as much if it's reversible like that. You know, I was thinking this was gonna be a big-time, but, uh, uh, yeah, I guess, it sounds manageable.;;change
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;22;therapist;Okay, and, uh, so talk to me a little bit more about what the doctors told you about-about your risks of stroke or heart attack while you're ta- while you have high cholesterol.;question;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;23;client;Oh, he just said that the risks are-are up, I think he called it elevated but, uh, you know, uh, that I'm at a higher risk of having a stroke or a heart attack down the line, uh, you know, that's down the line.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;24;therapist;Okay, well how important would it be for you to-to, uh, do whatever you can to reduce your risks of stroke or heart attack down the line?;question;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;25;client;Well, you know, my wife and I wanna retire in about four to five years and we wanna be really active visiting all sorts of places, The Fjords, Norway, things like that so I-I guess having a stroke or a heart attack would really be bad for that so and, you know, we-we-we wanna live our dreams actively.;;change
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;26;therapist;Yeah, and-and one of the- certainly one of the risks of stroke is paralysis, and if you wanna be active that could be-;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;27;client;Whoa.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;28;therapist;really a problem.;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;29;client;Yeah, no-no we-we wanna able to be very active.;;change
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;30;therapist;Okay, well this medicine can really help lower your risk of having a stroke or heart attack so that five years so now when you do retire you can enjoy it without any disability, uh, what are your thoughts about that?;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;31;client;Well, uh, I guess that's the-the way to go then cause I-I don't wanna be, you know, crippled by a stroke or a heart attack-;;change
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;32;therapist;Sure.;other;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;33;client;so take- taking the medicine sounds like the-the end of the game right now.;;change
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;34;therapist;Mm-hmm, yeah it would, I-I-I think that would, uh, go a long way toward reducing those risks.;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;35;client;Yeah.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;36;therapist;Okay, um, so if so where we are right now if I understand is you're feeling more comfortable about the concern about muscle weakness?;reflection;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;37;client;Oh yeah.;;change
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;38;therapist;Uh, you seem fairly committed to taking the medicine to reduce your risk so that you can enjoy your retirement.;reflection;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;39;client;Yeah.;;change
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;40;therapist;Uh, and so at this point, you're gonna get the medication and-;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;41;client;And the medicine can get my cholesterol down?;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;42;therapist;Definitely, can lower your cholesterol to 50%.;other;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;43;client;Wow, okay.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;44;therapist;So it's pretty effective.;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;45;client;Yeah, I'll take the medicine.;;change
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;46;therapist;Okay, um, and at some other point we can talk about some other things that you may be able to do including diet, changes in your eating habits, it can lower your cholesterol even more.;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;47;client;Okay.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;48;therapist;Okay?;other;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;49;client;That'd be fine.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;50;therapist;All right, uh, well they have your medication ready, and, uh, if you have any questions let us know.;therapist_input;
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;51;client;Fair enough, hey thanks.;;neutral
31;high;adhering to medical procedure;52;therapist;All right, good to meet you.;other;

31;high;adhering to medical procedure;54;therapist;Okay.;other;
127;high;asthma management;0;therapist;So, where you said you'd like to start, Sal, is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other.;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;1;client;Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, my asthma has just been out of control lately and my doctor says that might be connected to Oscar.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;2;therapist;Hmm. So, what- can you let me know or-or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse?;question;
127;high;asthma management;3;client;Um, I've got allergy testing. It's just, uh, the dust makes it bad. I thought the smoking was the main thing-;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;4;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
127;high;asthma management;5;client;-that's cut down. Um, and then they said the drinking might contribute to it, too. So, I got a lot of different things I'm working on. So that's what I know.;;change
127;high;asthma management;6;therapist;Hmm.;other;
127;high;asthma management;7;client;The drinking, the smoking and the dust that I got, the, um, the scratch test for.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;8;therapist;Right.;other;
127;high;asthma management;9;client;And-and-and that's what I know, and that I take the medicine for it.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;10;therapist;Okay. And that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern?;question;
127;high;asthma management;11;client;No, I've had it for-for 12 years and now it's a concern. I don't understand.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;12;therapist;Hmm. Yeah. And I-I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes. You've almost quit smoking.;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;14;therapist;You're just down to your last couple of cigarettes-;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;15;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;16;therapist;-and you're not even smoking those in the house.;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;17;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;18;therapist;So, your house is totally smoke-free.;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;19;client;Yes, just that work with the [unintelligible 00:01:24].;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;20;therapist;Yeah, okay. And you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol.;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;21;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;22;therapist;and-and I think you mentioned done-done a little bit towards that.;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;23;client;Mm-hmm. I'm a little I'm a couple of down. I used to drink four at night, now I'm down to three at least.;;change
127;high;asthma management;24;therapist;Okay, okay.;other;
127;high;asthma management;25;client;Uh-huh.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;26;therapist;So now almost like that's not good enough, like now you have to, now it's the dog and now-;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;27;client;Mm-hmm, what's next, yeah, yeah.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;28;therapist;-what's next. Right. Okay. So, I mean, there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse.;therapist_input;
127;high;asthma management;29;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;30;therapist;-but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar, you know, when he's in the house or-or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him, what happens with your asthma symptoms?;question;
127;high;asthma management;31;client;Well, we keep them clean, like he's cleaned. So, all the dander doesn't really make sense, but I have been noticing that sometimes when he comes on the bed or just beside, I wheeze a little bit, but I think it has to do with, um, the hair, the, in my lungs cleaning itself up from the smoking.;;sustain
127;high;asthma management;32;therapist;Okay.;other;
127;high;asthma management;33;client;So, I don't know if it's that-that's where I'm confused. I don't know how this could be happening.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;34;therapist;Hmm. So, it doesn't make total sense to you that-that it's all Oscar's fault and that-;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;35;client;Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;36;therapist;That's that the only solution.;other;
127;high;asthma management;37;client;But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;38;therapist;I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;39;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;40;therapist;such a big part of your life for so long.;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;41;client;Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. I just want some medicine and I want to keep Oscar and I wanna feel better about myself because I'm making all these changes in my life and it honestly feels like my-my nose is just above the water.;;sustain
127;high;asthma management;42;therapist;Hmm. Yeah. And-and in the end, you know, whatever you- whatever you do, about Oscar, about your asthma, about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda-setting worksheet, I mean, you are in the driver's seat solid. It really is your choice.;other;
127;high;asthma management;43;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, that feels good. That I, you know, at least it is my choice. I just feel like just about, I'm not feeling happy about just all these different things that are coming up. Um, and I'm kind of sad about things.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;44;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
127;high;asthma management;45;client;And I don't know, I don't know what to do.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;46;therapist;There's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife, with the new baby.;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;47;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;48;therapist;And now thinking about, looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby.;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;49;client;Mm-hmm. I want- I want John Carlos to grow up with Oscar. So he has his friend when he's young, too. And, um, I just, it's a lot of stress and a lot of things you-you gotta think about then, um, I'm not feeling good about it.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;50;therapist;Mm-hmm, so what-what would need to happen or how would you know, when you- when or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not?;question;
127;high;asthma management;51;client;Man, uh, how would I know? I don't know. I think if my asthma got really bad and the medicine- she gave me the strongest medicine and it wasn't working.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;52;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
127;high;asthma management;53;client;That would be the way right now 'cause I can't see, I don't know how I'm going to give this dog up.;;sustain
127;high;asthma management;54;therapist;Yeah and I get the feeling that it's something that you wanna think about that this is a really big decision-;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;55;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;56;therapist;-and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry.;reflection;
127;high;asthma management;57;client;No, no. It's something I got to just sit there and-and kind of, um, put the pros and the cons on the table about, but-;;neutral
127;high;asthma management;58;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
127;high;asthma management;59;client;-something's going on.;;neutral
92;low;asthma management;0;therapist;Hi, are you Julie Thompson?;other;
92;low;asthma management;1;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;neutral
92;low;asthma management;2;therapist;Hi, I'm Bruce Berger, I work in the clinic. I know you're here to pick up a prescription today.;reflection;
92;low;asthma management;3;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
92;low;asthma management;4;therapist;Um, I noticed, uh, we noticed some of your records that, uh, you've been coming in and getting Sarah's resc-rescue inhaler for her asthma quite frequently, and you haven't got a chronic inhaler for quite some time now. I also know she has been in the emergency room several times this year. Is-- can you tell me what's going on there?;therapist_input;
92;low;asthma management;5;client;Well, I did a research on the chronic inhaler, and I saw that there were steroids in it, and I do not want my daughter taking steroids. I read about all the side effects of steroids and all the potential health problems. I don't want her taking them, and I just want to tell you right up front, I do not want to hear anything about the fact that I do smoke. Um, I smoke outside, I smoke away from her. I do not ever do it around her. So I do not want to hear about that.;;sustain
92;low;asthma management;6;therapist;Well, I-I need to tell you that the-the medicine that she's taking, the chronic inhaler, which is really essential to controlling her asthma does-- is not a steroid like you're thinking. It's-it's much safer, it's very safe, she-- and she needs to take it to get her asthma under control, and I also want to tell you that, uh, your smoking does affect her asthma, even if- even if it's outside, it gets on her clothes, and to be honest, I'd like to see you quit smoking for you anyway. But, uh, if you want to keep her out of the emergency room, she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day, and you need to watch your smoking.;therapist_input;
92;low;asthma management;7;client;Okay, I-I am not going to allow her to take any kind of steroid. I am not going to allow that to happen. She's my daughter. She's my responsibility, and I'm not going to allow that to happen, and I absolutely make sure that the smoking does not affect her.;;sustain
92;low;asthma management;8;therapist;Okay, I, you know, I-I don't want to argue with you about this. I-I know that if you-you know, and if you want to keep Sarah out of the emergency room, uh, I-I just wish you'd heed what I'm saying. She needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her- to get her asthma under control, and the smoke on your clothes and the smoking flares her asthma up. So she really needs to use that chronic inhaler, and you really need to think about quitting smoking.;therapist_input;
92;low;asthma management;9;client;Fine. I'm in a really big hurry, and I need to get those prescriptions filled as soon as possible, please.;;neutral
92;low;asthma management;10;therapist;Okay, well, I-I hope you really listen to what I'm telling you about her using that chronic inhaler, and I hope you consider quitting smoking.;therapist_input;
92;low;asthma management;11;client;Fine. I just need to get my prescriptions.;;neutral
92;low;asthma management;12;therapist;Okay.;other;
59;low;compliance with rules;0;therapist;So, what you told me earlier was that you've got into a car with someone you knew had smoked marijuana earlier. What were you thinking?;therapist_input;

59;low;compliance with rules;2;therapist;Science fair project or not, don't you know what happens when someone drives under the influence of marijuana or alcohol? It's bad. They can wreck the car, you can lose your life. I thought you were smart, you're taking AP classes, you wanna get into a Ivy League school. This is not the way you do that.;therapist_input;
59;low;compliance with rules;3;client;It really wasn't that big of a deal.;;neutral
59;low;compliance with rules;4;therapist;It's a big deal. You can't drink either. You're 16. The drinking age is 21. I think you know that. You could get into an auto crash. Uh, I just wanted you to hear this. I don't' tolerate it as a doctor drinking or driving with somebody who's under the influence, and if you do it again, I'm gonna tell your parents.;therapist_input;
59;low;compliance with rules;5;client;Okay.;;neutral
103;high;compliance with rules;0;therapist;Thanks for coming back, [unintelligible 00:06:00]. I know last time we talked about, uh, maybe going out and joining some activities in the community-;other;

103;high;compliance with rules;2;therapist;to work on meeting some people, so;other;
103;high;compliance with rules;3;client;Yes, I guess.;;neutral
103;high;compliance with rules;4;therapist;-maybe you could tell me about how that's going?;question;
103;high;compliance with rules;5;client;Well, I didn't do anything yet. I didn't go-- I know I was gonna go, but I didn't. But, um, I did look at-- there's the YMCA, they've got some classes that I think will be pretty cool to go to, and then there's this yoga class over at the Women's Center that's only like 10 bucks, so I could do that, um-- but I didn't go because I'm really afraid that like what if-- you know, what if no-one likes me? What if I don't have friends in there?;;sustain
103;high;compliance with rules;6;therapist;Yeah, I know you've mentioned that in the past. When we were talking about the pros and cons of going out to one of these activities-;other;
103;high;compliance with rules;7;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
103;high;compliance with rules;8;therapist;-you really mentioned that anxiety-;reflection;

103;high;compliance with rules;12;therapist;I remember that.;other;

103;high;compliance with rules;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral
103;high;compliance with rules;16;therapist;-that you've wanted for some time.;reflection;
30;high;compliance with rules;0;therapist;Hey, Mary. I wanted to bring up to you, um, that your battery died last night. So, can you tell me what happened?;question;
30;high;compliance with rules;1;client;I don't know, and I still don't wanna charge it.;;sustain
30;high;compliance with rules;2;therapist;So, it's something you just aren't willing to do?;question;
30;high;compliance with rules;3;client;No. I got a lot of stuff to do, I don't need to charge it.;;sustain
30;high;compliance with rules;4;therapist;So, it's not really a priority for you right now, to be charging it?;reflection;
30;high;compliance with rules;5;client;No.;;sustain
30;high;compliance with rules;6;therapist;Okay. Um, and do you understand then the con-consequences of-of what that would be?;question;
30;high;compliance with rules;7;client;I guess so. I don't know. I-I-I honestly don't care what the consequences are.;;sustain
30;high;compliance with rules;8;therapist;Okay. Um, would it be okay if I do share you what will happen if you don't charge your battery.;question;
30;high;compliance with rules;9;client;Sure. I'll listen.;;neutral
30;high;compliance with rules;10;therapist;Um, you will be getting violations for that, and then if you get so many violations, I mean, we'd have to write a warrant for your arrest, which is looking more of, um, detention time.;therapist_input;
30;high;compliance with rules;11;client;Whatever.;;sustain
30;high;compliance with rules;12;therapist;And that's still doesn't seem to bother you.;question;

30;high;compliance with rules;14;therapist;Okay.;other;
30;high;compliance with rules;15;client;It really [unintelligible 00:00:58]-- I don't care.;;sustain
30;high;compliance with rules;16;therapist;Um, so I know that you, you know, you know the consequences of it, and yet you're sharing with me it's just not a priority for you at this time.;question;
30;high;compliance with rules;17;client;Nope.;;sustain
30;high;compliance with rules;18;therapist;Okay. You know, that is your choice. I mean, I-I-I can't make those choices for you, it is something that you decide to do. Um, so with that being said then, these will be the consequences. I'll have to read the-the violation for you.;therapist_input;
30;high;compliance with rules;19;client;Yeah, whatever. I Know you got to do your job, but I don't care.;;sustain
30;high;compliance with rules;20;therapist;Okay. Um, any questions about that? Any questions about kind of the next steps from here?;question;
30;high;compliance with rules;21;client;I mean, whatever happens happens. I'll deal with it when it happens.;;sustain
30;high;compliance with rules;22;therapist;So, your confidence that you'll be able to deal with possibly going back to detention?;question;
30;high;compliance with rules;23;client;I mean, I'll just deal with it when it comes.;;neutral
30;high;compliance with rules;24;therapist;Okay, and it sounds like you know that it's probably coming then?;question;
30;high;compliance with rules;25;client;Yeah, I guess so.;;neutral
30;high;compliance with rules;26;therapist;Okay. Well, you know I will be back later. If any questions would arise, we can always talk about that then. Um, otherwise, again, I will have to write a violation, and, um, if you have any questions or need anything from me, please let me know. Um, otherwise, again, I'll be back later today.;therapist_input;
30;high;compliance with rules;27;client;Okay.;;neutral
30;high;compliance with rules;28;therapist;All right.;other;

48;high;diabetes management;7;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;
48;high;diabetes management;8;client;So, I guess I'll make it short to exactly the incident 'cause I know we can't avoid it now. Uh, yeah, well, that one what happened was I-I was invited to my first party in this crew-;;neutral

48;high;diabetes management;15;therapist;Uh-huh. Uh-huh.;other;

48;high;diabetes management;17;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;
48;high;diabetes management;18;client;Which was the reason why I didn't want quite to address 'cause I know better. I-;;change

48;high;diabetes management;26;client;Yeah.;;change
48;high;diabetes management;27;therapist;Yeah, clearly, you made a decision because you didn't want to stand out in some way I'm guessing. So, let's-let's talk more about that. Tell me where would you like to take this?;reflection;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;So you shared that you're, um, here today because you're having some dissatisfaction with your body and your confidence and your mood and your energy.

Um, but first, I'd love to hear what are your philosophies about health and wellbeing?;question;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Um, I definitely, uh, you know, I-I strive to be physically healthy, but I also have in my life seeing how that impacts me mentally. Um, so I think if I'm- if I'm able to do the things that I wanna do and, um, you know, that I'm feeling good about where I'm at mentally, then that's kind of my end goal, always. Um, yeah, so this body dissatisfaction piece has really just kinda thrown a wrench in that and it's been enough of a challenge that I thought I should seek out someone who can really help me through that piece.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;Yeah. Well, I'm so glad that you reached out for help, um, and just know that you're not alone. And-and so, yeah, is that okay if I share a little bit about, um, how I tend to work with clients on that topic?;question;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;Yes, please.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;Yeah. Well, um, first of all, I really am passionate about looking at the whole picture, um, physical health and emotional wellbeing and what I found in working with clients in the past is when, um, we make a focus of weight loss, sometimes, uh, physical health improves, but at the cost of emotional wellbeing.;therapist_input;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;Um, many people find that when then- when they are restricting their intake or starting some, uh, ac-activity patterns that are really rigorous, that, um, a piece of their mental health suffers because they start to obsess, um, more than they'd like to be about those things. So, my approach with clients is just a more holistic approach. Looking at certainly some behavior changes that you could make to be more physically active, improve your energy levels.;therapist_input;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;7;therapist;Um, and also look at activities that enhance your mood. We can also take a look at some dietary patterns and see if-if there are ways you could tweak how you're fueling your body throughout the day, but at the same time, sort of letting go of what happens on the scale. Letting go of, um, the final, you know, weight outcome of that, and really focusing instead on healing your relationship with food and also adopting sustainable physical activity patterns. What do you make of all that?;therapist_input;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;8;client;So, like, for example, having like a-a set out meal plan, um, you know, where I'm eating certain food groups or certain macronutrients, for example, that wouldn't necessarily follow that same approach.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;9;therapist;Yeah, I-I found in the past when working with clients that creating a prescriptive meal plan, um, tends to work for a few days, but then clients usually get really tired of the foods on there. Um, and so instead, I'm really more interested in equipping you to learn how to space your meals and snacks out in a way that makes your body feel energized. Um, and then I can also support you, you know, in looking at the grocery shopping patterns and the meal planning patterns that come alongside all of that. Um, so really teaching you how to do more of your own meal planning, um, to fuel your body in a way that gives you energy, but also in a way where you're really still enjoying food.;therapist_input;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;10;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;11;therapist;Food is meant to be enjoyed, and it's a source of pleasure. So I'd want to help you certainly look for ways to add more fruits and vegetables and-and things that nourish your body, but also look for ways to add pleasure-;other;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;12;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;13;therapist;to your meals and snacks.;other;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;14;client;Okay, yeah.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;15;therapist;Think about all of that.;question;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;16;client;Well, I think it makes sense, especially like-like you said, to be sustainable. Um, yeah, I definitely wouldn't wanna try something where I'm going to crash and burn for days in.;;change
29;high;diet and weight loss management;17;therapist;Yeah.;other;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;18;client;Um, when you talk about activity and you mentioned like really, um, like rigorous activity types, um, like I go to a gym and I enjoy going to the gym when I was active.;;change
29;high;diet and weight loss management;19;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;20;client;Um, would that be kind of against that philosophy too or I guess, can you explain that a bit more?;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;21;therapist;Yeah, I'm all about trying to help you figure out what types of physical activity bring you the most joy because those are the things that you'll make time for.;other;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;22;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;23;therapist;So if-if the gym is what brings you the most joy, then we can work with that, but if you, um, start to think about it and discover there other activities that you're more excited to attend and you're more, um, you're looking at rear-rearranging your schedule too because you really want to be there-;therapist_input;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;24;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;25;therapist;-um, then we can pursue those things. So it's really just about what brings you joy in terms of how you move your body and I'm just here to help you figure that out.;therapist_input;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;26;client;Cool, so both with the foods and the activity, we would be working to find things that I like to do-;;change
29;high;diet and weight loss management;27;therapist;Yeah.;other;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;28;client;-that I could do for longer periods versus more of like you said, the prescriptive approach.;;change
29;high;diet and weight loss management;29;therapist;Exactly. Yeah. So helping you find changes that feel sustainable because they bring you both nourishment health, but also pleasure.;reflection;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;30;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah, no, I think that-that all sounds good. Um, you know, I still would want to lose weight.;;change
29;high;diet and weight loss management;31;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;32;client;Um, and I know you said weight loss isn't really the goal, so I-;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;33;therapist;Sure.;other;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;34;client;-I just want to be upfront about that part with me and maybe that changes or maybe it doesn't, but what do you think about that.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;35;therapist;Absolutely, I appreciate you sharing that piece with me and you absolutely get to have that desire. And, um, we certainly are bombarded all day long with messages about how a body is supposed to look and so we all, um, certainly have moments of feeling dissatisfied with how our bodies look. And so you're absolutely, um, welcome to hold that and we can have space for that and you can certainly talk about that in these sessions. And I'll check in with you as we're going through the process of behavior change, um, to see how your body confidence is, um, as we talk more.;therapist_input;
29;high;diet and weight loss management;36;client;Great. Yeah, now that sounds good.;;neutral
29;high;diet and weight loss management;37;therapist;Fantastic. Thanks, Natalie.;other;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;0;therapist;Hi, John. Nice to see you again. So, tell me, how are things going?;question;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;1;client;Well, doc, I know you told me that I need to lose weight. And even though the scale didn't show today, I was able to lose about 5 pounds, but then I gained it right back.;;neutral
2;high;diet and weight loss management;2;therapist;Well, I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront. Do you mind if we explore this issue further?;question;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;3;client;No, by all means. I know we have to discuss it.;;neutral
2;high;diet and weight loss management;4;therapist;All right. Uh, well, it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently. And I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have it come back again. So, tell me what you did to lose that initial 5 pounds.;reflection;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;5;client;I started watching what I ate and I ate less. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables. I've also been walking a lot. I'm walking up to 20 minutes a day now. I saw the weight come slowly off, um, and I felt better. But then when I watched it come back on again, you know, I gave up.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;6;therapist;But you did have some success. Tell me how you felt when you lost the weight.;reflection;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;7;client;I felt great and I felt really proud of myself. I thought that this was something that I could do.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;8;therapist;Okay. Well, it sounds like you realized that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's gonna affect your overall health. So, tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back.;reflection;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;9;client;Well, I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, that- that's it.;;sustain
2;high;diet and weight loss management;10;therapist;And how many servings of fruits and vegetables on average per day would you have?;question;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;11;client;To be honest, I have four or five -- four to six glasses of orange juice a day. Um, I have fruit for lunch and breakfast. I have, uh, usually one to two servings of a vegetable like lettuce or broccoli with thinner.;;neutral
2;high;diet and weight loss management;12;therapist;John, it's very important that you recognize that some fruits, but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories. Did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola?;therapist_input;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;13;client;No, I didn't know. Um, but doesn't the fruit- food pyramid classify, um, fruit juice as a- a serving?;;neutral
2;high;diet and weight loss management;14;therapist;You're absolutely right, but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only. When it comes to nutrition, we have to have a more personalized approach. So I have a hunch, and that is the excess fruit that you were consuming probably caused your weight rebound. What's your impression?;therapist_input;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;15;client;Well, this changes quite a bit. I mean, here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;16;therapist;Indeed. Let me ask you something, knowing what you know now, how important is it to you to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking in?;question;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;17;client;Obviously, I need to cut back on the fruit juice. But boy, do I love that OJ.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;18;therapist;Oh, I understand. Let me ask you this, on a scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning that there's no way you can do it, and 10 meaning that you're 100% confident that you can do it, how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking in.;therapist_input;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;19;client;Um, six or seven.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;20;therapist;All right. So, you're not a zero. So, that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable, this is something you certainly can do it. Why are you not a zero?;question;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;21;client;I guess it's because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;22;therapist;So, you realize, again, that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in, you're gonna decrease your weight, you're gonna feel better, and you're gonna impact your po- health positively?;reflection;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;23;client;Yes.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;24;therapist;But you're also not a 10, and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success. What would it take for you to be a 10 or even an 8 or 9?;question;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;25;client;Getting the fruit juice of the house because I know if it's there I'll drink it. My wife does the shopping for us, so maybe if I ask her not to get the juice, that would solve it.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;26;therapist;Okay. Now, if the juice was still there, can you think of anything else you could do?;question;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;27;client;I suppose I could replace it with, um, a low-calorie drink or drink more water.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;28;therapist;Excellent. John, I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction. And the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in. So if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're t- drinking and how you did it, what would you tell me?;reflection;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;29;client;I'd say I didn't have any and I substituted it with, um, sugar-free drinks.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;30;therapist;Excellent. Well, it sounds like you have a plan. Same scale, 0 to 10, how confident are you that you can, uh, make this happen?;question;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;31;client;A 10.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;32;therapist;I agree. All right. Well, you-you know what? I'm not gonna start any medications today. Your levels were a little bit off, but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint. What do you think?;therapist_input;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;33;client;Great. It sounds good to me.;;change
2;high;diet and weight loss management;34;therapist;Excellent. I'll see you in two weeks.;therapist_input;
2;high;diet and weight loss management;35;client;Okay.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Emily. How are you?;question;
74;low;managing life;1;client;I'm doing all right. How are you?;;neutral
74;low;managing life;2;therapist;I'm good. Um, wow, what's changed? What do we have here?;question;
74;low;managing life;3;client;Oh, I got my lip pierced.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;4;therapist;Emily, why? Why did you get your lip pierced?;question;
74;low;managing life;5;client;Why? I don't know. I wanted a change and-;;neutral
74;low;managing life;6;therapist;You're-;other;
74;low;managing life;7;client;it seems kind of cool;;neutral
74;low;managing life;8;therapist;gorgeous. your teeth are lovely. you do not need a piercing.;therapist_input;
74;low;managing life;9;client;Well, I mean, nobody needs a piercing, I wanted one. It was a-;;neutral
74;low;managing life;10;therapist;Do you know what-;question;
74;low;managing life;11;client;nice change.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;12;therapist;those oral piercings can do to your teeth?;question;
74;low;managing life;13;client;Oh, I mean, it's my lip that's pierced, not my teeth.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;14;therapist;Well, yes, except that, you know what's gonna happen. See how-- Do you feel how when you're moving your lips-- Smile for me. Okay. So, do you see how when your muscles are moving, that piercing is rubbing against your gums-;therapist_input;
74;low;managing life;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;16;therapist;-as well as your teeth. So, we can see some recession that's gonna start to happen-;therapist_input;
74;low;managing life;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;18;therapist;-possibly, um, affecting the tooth itself, chipping the tooth, et cetera. So, it's something that we definitely don't like to see.;therapist_input;
74;low;managing life;19;client;I mean, it's been okay so far. It hasn't caused me any problems.;;sustain
74;low;managing life;20;therapist;Well, it's only been a month.;therapist_input;
74;low;managing life;21;client;Yeah.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;22;therapist;I think it [unintelligible 00:01:18] days yet, and it might not be a bad idea to reconsider the piercing.;therapist_input;
74;low;managing life;23;client;I mean, I just put in-;;neutral
74;low;managing life;24;therapist;Just-;other;
74;low;managing life;25;client;-I'm not gonna take it right out. It's-- Like you said, I've only had it in for a month, I mean.;;sustain
74;low;managing life;26;therapist;Emily, I've been seeing you for so long and you know that I really just-- I think you have lovely teeth and I've watched you, you know, just mature, et cetera, and I hate-- I'd hate to see you wreck your teeth for something like this. I really would.;therapist_input;
74;low;managing life;27;client;Well, I mean, if it starts to cause a problem, then maybe we talk about it, but at this point, I mean-;;sustain
74;low;managing life;28;therapist;All right.;other;
74;low;managing life;29;client;-it's fine.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;30;therapist;All right. Okay.;other;
74;low;managing life;31;client;Yeah.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;32;therapist;Okay.;other;
74;low;managing life;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;34;therapist;Okay. We'll continue with the exam, but you know where I stand on this. Okay?;therapist_input;
74;low;managing life;35;client;All right.;;neutral
74;low;managing life;36;therapist;All right.;other;
74;low;managing life;37;client;Yeah.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Scott.;other;
58;high;managing life;1;client;Hi.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;2;therapist;Hi. You were saying over the phone, uh, you want to talk about exercise?;question;
58;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;4;therapist;Okay, alright. Where would you like to start with that?;question;
58;high;managing life;5;client;Well, I'm, uh, I-I used to work out pretty good. I-I would go to the gym several times a week. I had kind of a schedule, um—;;neutral
58;high;managing life;6;therapist;That's really a lot. Very good.;reflection;
58;high;managing life;7;client;Yeah, well, you know, it really-- At-at one time, I was running-- I ran a half marathon. I was really into it, and, uh--.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;8;therapist;Wow.;other;
58;high;managing life;9;client;Well, and I-- But I was working at a different company, where I had a little bit different schedule, a little more free time than I have now, so I just don't have the time like I used to.;;sustain
58;high;managing life;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
58;high;managing life;11;client;And I-- And really, it's kind of an excuse, I guess, cause I-I could probably make the time, but it's-it's easier to just keep working or-;;change
58;high;managing life;12;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
58;high;managing life;13;client;just being in bed or whatever.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;14;therapist;But that goal of the half-marathon, you know, it's really important that you were willing to put all the time into getting ready for it, which, from what I've heard from other people, is almost like a job in and of itself.;reflection;
58;high;managing life;15;client;I-it was. A-and it was huge for me cause I'd never really been a runner, you know, but it-it was very motivating, and-and—;;change
58;high;managing life;16;therapist;What'd you like about it?;question;
58;high;managing life;17;client;I don't know. I guess there's kind of an adrenaline rush to it. Kinda almost like, you know, uh, kind of a high, I guess.;;change
58;high;managing life;18;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;
58;high;managing life;19;client;So yeah-- That's-- I-I really enjoyed it. And I-I liked the feeling that I was doing something good for myself. I liked that, too. I-it kind of-- It so-- It gave me a little bit of self-esteem, I guess.;;change
58;high;managing life;20;therapist;I-it a-almost, um, feels like you identified as being a runner, like an athlete?;reflection;
58;high;managing life;21;client;I-I subscribed to the magazine a while.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;22;therapist;Do you really?;question;
58;high;managing life;23;client;I did.;;change
58;high;managing life;24;therapist;[unintelligible 00:01:40];other;
58;high;managing life;25;client;I let-- I lit it on fire but I-;;neutral
58;high;managing life;26;therapist;Okay.;other;
58;high;managing life;27;client;I did burn for a time.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;28;therapist;Got into the culture?;reflection;
58;high;managing life;29;client;I got into the whole culture. I was-- I-I felt as good as I’ve felt in many, many years. And now I’ve kind of let that all slide, and-- Well, I had a foot injury, too, which kind of started the whole problem.;;change
58;high;managing life;30;therapist;Okay, alright. Cause it’s tough, it's really, it is. I mean I’ve, um, I’m sure you’ve been told before by whomever, uh, diagnosed your foot injury, but if not, let me know if it gets so tough on your body [unintelligible 00:02:10] let me know. So--;other;
58;high;managing life;31;client;It-it is. And I-- it-it may be why I can’t really run again, but I can certainly, you know, ride a stationary bike-;;change
58;high;managing life;32;therapist;Okay.;other;
58;high;managing life;33;client;-and do all the other things in a gym that you can do when you’re not running, so, it just nakes you to [unintelligible 00:02:23];;change
58;high;managing life;34;therapist;Oh, and yet and at the same time you know your body well enough, and you-you’re willing to pay attention to your doctor’s advice about the running, right now, for you, not the best thing. Um, so, riding a stationary bike. Um, what else do you like to do that's cardiovascular?;question;
58;high;managing life;35;client;Um, well, um, I like-- The bike is pretty good. Uh, even the uh, you know, the kind of a rolling machine is okay. And the uh, the elliptical. Any of that’s fine. I-I really don’t, uh-- I don’t dislike any of it. Kind of once you get into the rhythm, yeah, it’s fine;;change
58;high;managing life;36;therapist;If you were to pick one of those, which one do you enjoy the most, um, would be most likely to do?;question;
58;high;managing life;37;client;Probably the elliptical.;;change
58;high;managing life;38;therapist;The elliptical. Okay. Yeah. [unintelligible 00:03:07] like kind of almost like running.;other;
58;high;managing life;39;client;Well, it is.;;change
58;high;managing life;40;therapist;[chuckles].;other;
58;high;managing life;41;client;It is without any of the impact, so it is true.;;change
58;high;managing life;42;therapist;Okay. And-and what do you- do you-- Some folks, you know, [unintelligible 00:03:18] put on music, kind of- kind of.;other;
58;high;managing life;43;client;Yeah, I do headphones.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;44;therapist;Yeah.;other;
58;high;managing life;45;client;I got my headphones, and I got my, uh, kind of [unintelligible 00:03:24], if you know what I mean;;neutral
58;high;managing life;46;therapist;Okay. Get your rocking out, running on the elliptical playlist.;reflection;
58;high;managing life;47;client;Yeah;;neutral
58;high;managing life;48;therapist;And, um, so you were-- You said that you’ve been going several times a week, which is really an extraordinary number, I-I think it’s four, five times a week?;question;
58;high;managing life;49;client;Yeah. I was going literally every other day, you know. And then, some days I would, you know, I’d run, and I’d go to the gym the next day, so I would-- I was very-- I don’t really feel it necessary to get back to that level, but I need to do something cause I’m doing nothing right now.;;change
58;high;managing life;50;therapist;Nothing. Okay.;reflection;
58;high;managing life;51;client;I should-- Or next to nothing. I walk to the grocery store or whatever’s handy when I have time, but yeah.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;52;therapist;So what ideas do you have about initially just getting started, and what-what would you do [unintelligible 00:04:13] ?;question;
58;high;managing life;53;client;Well, if I could just get myself over there once, 'cause usually that’s the hardest thing. It’s just going there. So I think that's-- You know, I’ve thought about it a little bit, I think I just need to make that first trip over there and just kind of to take it easy that first time. Just show up 'cause I think that’s really what I need to do. I justt need to go over there.;;change
58;high;managing life;54;therapist;What would help you do that?;question;
58;high;managing life;55;client;Um, knowing that my schedule isn’t gonna be too crazy that day where I could spare an hour or so, and-and just go do it.;;change
58;high;managing life;56;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
58;high;managing life;57;client;And then I-- [unintelligible 00:04:41] kinda nice [unintelligible 00:4:42] gonna be troublesome.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;58;therapist;[unintelligible 00:04:45]?;other;
58;high;managing life;59;client;Um, I don’t know. I think- I think the time has just been the biggest thing, you know, and-and I-I guess the motivation really hasn’t been there. I mean, you know, it’s not like- I don’t really have a goal. I don’t really have a, you know I don't, other than maybe reducing my waistline, you know, I don't really have a-a set number like I'm gonna run a marathon and you know.;;change
58;high;managing life;60;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
58;high;managing life;61;client;You know, so I think the just running off the playlist. I-I guess maybe if I made a goal would helped too.;;change
58;high;managing life;62;therapist;Mm-hmm- mm-hmm. So that-that-that half marathon was, uh, a very specific concrete thing and you could envision yourself, and you're ready for it and the day of and all that kinda stuff.;reflection;
58;high;managing life;63;client;Yeah.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;64;therapist;Um.;other;
58;high;managing life;65;client;Plus there's people who have done that countless times and you can go read what their-;;change
58;high;managing life;66;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
58;high;managing life;67;client;-regimen was so you get feedback too. And then [unintelligible 00:05:37] did this from this day and so on.;;change
58;high;managing life;68;therapist;So sometimes-- almost sounds like, um, your feedback would be, uh, useful to you. Like some immediate feedback in terms of like, um, like [inaudible 00:05:53];reflection;
58;high;managing life;69;client;Yeah. Maybe.;;change
58;high;managing life;70;therapist;[inaudible 00:05:55];other;
58;high;managing life;71;client;That might not be be a bad idea. [inaudible 00:05:59];;change
58;high;managing life;72;therapist;[inaudible 00:06:01];other;
58;high;managing life;73;therapist;-somebody there and, you know, hooking up with somebody.;therapist_input;
58;high;managing life;74;client;I think that'd be great. I-I never have really found anybody that like to exercise with the pace that I wanted to. They were all either going way too fast or not even moving at all.;;change
58;high;managing life;75;therapist;Okay.;other;
58;high;managing life;76;client;So it's kinda hard to meet up with somebody that can kind of maybe kind of give you a push [unintelligible 00:06:38]-;;sustain
58;high;managing life;77;therapist;Okay.;other;
58;high;managing life;78;client;might be a challenge.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;79;therapist;There might be something [unintelligible 00:06:43] because you're such a social guy. And so to be able to be exercising and be talking and enjoying yourself- you like the music too, right?;reflection;
58;high;managing life;80;client;Yeah, that's right, well I-;;neutral
58;high;managing life;81;therapist;And if you arrange to meet somebody there, you're very good at, uh, you know, uh, keeping the agreement.;therapist_input;
58;high;managing life;82;client;Okay, that's a great idea I hadn't thought of that-that's- I hadn't really, uh, I-I kinda dismissed that early on, I hadn't really even considered that, yeah.;;change
58;high;managing life;83;therapist;And in for right now it just be, you'll be happy with getting there one time.;reflection;
58;high;managing life;84;client;If I could get there-- I know if I could get there-- if I could pick, you know, uh, these are the days I'm going to go to the gym and I know these things last time.;;change
58;high;managing life;85;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
58;high;managing life;86;client;So if I- if I could-- I mean, I wanna get there three times a week.;;change
58;high;managing life;87;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
58;high;managing life;88;client;I wanna get there on Saturdays or Sundays and Tuesdays and Fridays, or something like that, then I could probably [unintelligible 00:07:34];;change
58;high;managing life;89;therapist;And days that you know of on your less rigorous schedule that you're more likely to succeed [unintelligible 00:07:40] I really like how you're picking like three days a week instead of some days a week.;reflection;
58;high;managing life;90;client;Right, yeah. Well, it's just not-;;neutral
58;high;managing life;91;therapist;Very clear you understand the whole idea of giving yourself a day off in between.;reflection;
58;high;managing life;92;client;Oh yeah, yeah, it doesn't do any good to just try to injure your- injure yourself especially when you're a bit normal like me.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;93;therapist;Okay, yeah, I know that, yeah, yeah. Okay, so. So, um, so are you sure you wanna try to start out with the- that initial [unintelligible 00:08:07];reflection;
58;high;managing life;94;client;You gotta get over there.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;95;therapist;When you find someone to go with, great, if not, you get your own [unintelligible 00:08:12] your own music and uh, I'll be- I'll be trying just to-to see um, what is like for you, having actually done that [unintelligible 00:08:20];reflection;
58;high;managing life;96;client;Very good.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;97;therapist;Yeah, okay.;other;
58;high;managing life;98;client;Thank you.;;neutral
58;high;managing life;99;therapist;Thanks.;other;
58;high;managing life;100;client;All right, bye-bye.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;0;therapist;Hi, Mrs. Smith. It's really nice to see you again. I see you're back to follow up on the stroke you had. How are things going for you at the rehab facility?;question;
77;high;managing life;1;client;[signs] Kind of slow.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;2;therapist;Kind of slow?;question;
77;high;managing life;3;client;Yeah.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;4;therapist;What kind of things have you been in your rehab?;question;
77;high;managing life;5;client;Oh, they have me doing all kinds of things in different machines and stuff. Yeah, it hurts.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;6;therapist;It hurts? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you having pain?;question;
77;high;managing life;7;client;Well, just about every joint like especially my knees. They're really-- They have me doing some leg things that-that-that is it really necessary?;;neutral
77;high;managing life;8;therapist;Well, you know, I-I understand that pain is hard to work through but a lot of time when you're having rehab after a stroke, that pain is telling you that your muscles and joints are starting to work again. So you can kind of think of it as a positive way to, you know, know that your-your body's getting back to normal.;therapist_input;
77;high;managing life;9;client;Okay.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;10;therapist;But what are your goals for the long term?;question;
77;high;managing life;11;client;I wanna go home.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;12;therapist;Oh, of course, of course. And what are the things that you'd like to be able to do once you get home?;question;
77;high;managing life;13;client;Everything. I wanna- I wanna, play with my dog. I miss my dog. I wanna cook for myself. I'm a very independent person and I wanna do things for myself.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;14;therapist;Yeah, yeah. And so that's a very important goal to be able to get back home, to be able to get back to your independence. Have you thought about what it might take to get there?;question;
77;high;managing life;15;client;Um, I guess the rehab.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;16;therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And it's also going to be very important that once you're home, you're able to continue on a regular activity program. Have you thought about what that might look like?;question;
77;high;managing life;17;client;Not really.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;18;therapist;Not really, okay. Well, have you ever heard of something called Tai Chi? Is that a familiar term to you?;question;
77;high;managing life;19;client;Oh, yeah.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;20;therapist;You've heard of it?;question;
77;high;managing life;21;client;Uh, I have.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;22;therapist;Okay.;other;
77;high;managing life;23;client;I have a friend who, uh, does it and she just raves about it. She loves it.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;24;therapist;Well, you know, Tai Chi is one of the best ways to get your balance back after you've had something like a stroke. And it's also really good for preventing falls. And if you wanna be home and you wanna be doing the things you wanna do and going for walks with your dog, it's very important to make sure that you don't fall 'cause that would cause more problems down the road.;therapist_input;
77;high;managing life;25;client;Absolutely. I do not want to fall, for sure.;;change
77;high;managing life;26;therapist;So what do you think about Tai Chi? Is that something you think you might be able to try sometime?;question;
77;high;managing life;27;client;Well, I-I hadn't really thought about it, but yeah I guess, I guess.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;28;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
77;high;managing life;29;client;Like I said, my friend talks about it and-and it's very pretty. I've seen pictures, you know.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;30;therapist;Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's not that easy to get started. You do certainly have to have some motivation to want to do it. Um, and when you first start, oftentimes you do feel a little wobbly or a little insecure.;therapist_input;
77;high;managing life;31;client;Well, I don't see how I could do it. I-I'm still in a walker, you know.;;sustain
77;high;managing life;32;therapist;Yeah, yeah, I understand. So there are lots of places around that have it. Your local senior center would have it. And what I recommend is that you start by doing it in a chair. Just sitting in the chair.;therapist_input;
77;high;managing life;33;client;I could?;;neutral
77;high;managing life;34;therapist;You could. You can talk to the instructor and that way you won't fall, you'll feel confident and you'll start to learn some of the moves. And then gradually over time, as you get a little bit better at doing the moves in a chair, you can start to stand up, use the chair to lean on, and then eventually, you'll be able to get to the point where you can do it on your own.;therapist_input;
77;high;managing life;35;client;And you really recommend this?;;neutral
77;high;managing life;36;therapist;You know, it cuts your risk of falls in half. It also helps to reduce pain although that's not a short-term benefit, you do have to stick with it for at least three to six months to start have it help reduce your pain. But it does have a number of things that I think would get you to your goals of being home and able to play with your dog and doing your own cooking and things like that.;therapist_input;
77;high;managing life;37;client;You do Tai Chi?;;neutral
77;high;managing life;38;therapist;I do Tai Chi. I do it three days a week and it's really helped my balance as well.;therapist_input;
77;high;managing life;39;client;Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Um, listen, anything that's going to get me home and if you do it and you recommend it, I'll try it.;;change
77;high;managing life;40;therapist;All right. Well, I'm delighted. It's a pleasure to see you again. I hope your rehab continues to go well and we can talk some more about this at our next visit.;other;
77;high;managing life;41;client;Okay, okay.;;neutral
77;high;managing life;42;therapist;All right. Thank you for coming in.;other;
124;high;managing life;0;therapist;Okay. So what ideas do you have, Natalie for, um, getting started in adding more physical activity?;question;
124;high;managing life;1;client;Well, I think, um, like when I was really active in the past, I enjoy going to the gym and I like that regardless of what's happening with the weather outside, that-that's always an option. Um, so I've kind of already started to look and see, like, how much gym memberships cost in the area. Um, I really like one that's like month to month and doesn't require me to pay out for like a year because, in the summertime, I just don't use that when the weather is nice, I like to be outside.;;change
124;high;managing life;2;client;So, um, I do think that that would be an option. Um, I did enjoy doing yoga in the past. I, um, I don't care for swimming, uh, because it requires a lot of extra prep time, and like, I don't- chlorine in my hair just doesn't really go very well usually. Um, but I really like walking, um, weightlifting, running is okay. Um, that was more at my, like, peak activity level, so I don't think I could start out running now, but I'd like to work up to it.;;change
124;high;managing life;3;therapist;Great. It sounds like there are a lot of activities that you do like-;reflection;
124;high;managing life;4;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
124;high;managing life;5;therapist;-and I'm hearing a theme of climate control, [chuckles] being important to you and you've already been researching gyms.;reflection;
124;high;managing life;6;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
124;high;managing life;7;therapist;Tell me more about that.;question;
124;high;managing life;8;client;"Yeah. So I just- on my phone, if I'm like in the grocery store, I'm kind of just looking through, and on Google, I'll type in like ""Gyms in the area"" and I'll look and see what's there. And, um, I don't ever want to sign up to learn more 'cause I feel like then they just keep emailing you forever. So at this point, I'm just trying to kind of figure out what I can, based on their website as far as cost goes, but that, um, month to month is kind of really important for me. Just like I mentioned, I don't want to be paying for six months or a year out.";;sustain
124;high;managing life;9;therapist;Right. Okay. So you're looking for some-something that's reasonably priced-;reflection;
124;high;managing life;10;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
124;high;managing life;11;therapist;-and that you don't have to sign a contract and you're right. It's hard to tell what the cost is just from looking on the website.;reflection;
124;high;managing life;12;client;Yeah.;;neutral
124;high;managing life;13;therapist;And I completely agree [laughs]about wanting to avoid the sales pitch-;reflection;
124;high;managing life;14;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
124;high;managing life;15;therapist;-um, element of it. What seems like a logical next step based on-- You've kind of already gotten the ball rolling. What feels like a logical next step?;question;
124;high;managing life;16;client;Yeah, I think, um, you know, I've kind of looked around and seen what I- what's available to me. Um, I think the next step would be to maybe go visit one place and just see, like, what equipment they have. Um, I also think too, I'd like to be outside when the weather permits. I like to walk. I just- I don't like rain or snow or cold, like, um, I don't like doing things when I'm just not in a climate that's enjoyable. So if there is, uh, decent weather, I think going outside and, you know, getting some steps in or just walking would be a good first start for me.;;change
124;high;managing life;17;therapist;Okay. So maybe visiting a gym and then also choosing a non-gym activity to sort of get started when the weather's permitting.;reflection;
124;high;managing life;18;client;Right. Yeah.;;change
124;high;managing life;19;therapist;I have one, um, idea that is jumping into my mind as you're talking. Is it okay if I share that?;question;
124;high;managing life;20;client;Sure. Yeah.;;neutral
124;high;managing life;21;therapist;I'm wondering about the price of the YMCA compared to other gyms. Uh, is that one that you have an interest in or have looked at already?;therapist_input;
124;high;managing life;22;client;I don't know that I've looked closely at that. I don't know much about their pricing or anything like that.;;neutral
124;high;managing life;23;therapist;Yes. And honestly, I don't either. [chuckles] I just suspect that it might be slightly cheaper than some of the more private gyms.;other;
124;high;managing life;24;client;I agree.;;neutral
124;high;managing life;25;therapist;So something to look into if you're interested.;reflection;
124;high;managing life;26;client;Yeah, definitely.;;change
124;high;managing life;27;therapist;And they-- I would suspect they'd be less sales pitch-oriented than a private gym. So it might be a safe place to explore first-;therapist_input;
124;high;managing life;28;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
124;high;managing life;29;therapist;and to build some confidence in that conversation.;reflection;
124;high;managing life;30;client;Yeah, no, yeah. That's a good-good recommendation. I'll definitely check it out.;;change
124;high;managing life;31;therapist;Okay. Great. So, um, in addition to exploring the gym possibility, what sounds like a logical next step for a non-gym activity to get started, some small goal that feels doable, um, and you have control over because it doesn't require the perfect weather-;question;
124;high;managing life;32;client;Mm-hmm.;;change
124;high;managing life;33;therapist;or the perfect gym?;reflection;
124;high;managing life;34;client;Yeah. I think, you know, finding ways to walk more would be good, um, even if that is inside somewhere. Uh, I've done the like trick of parking in the back of the parking lot and walking up to the store. Um, and like I've also been in Target and taken an extra lap, which is kind of dangerous too 'cause you might spend more money. Um, but I- I think if the weather's nice too, I would like to get outside and try to find a place to walk. Um, and two, I really did enjoy yoga, it's- it was good for my, like, flexibility and posture, and so I would be interested in maybe seeing too what classes are available in the area. I haven't looked at that at all.;;change
124;high;managing life;35;therapist;Okay. So exploring some yoga classes. Is-is doing yoga in your living room appealing to you at all?;question;
124;high;managing life;36;client;Home workouts have never really worked for me in the past just because there's so many distractions, and I can, like, set the mat out there and everything and get everything ready, like bottled water, everything's good to go. And then it just sits there and I don't actually do it, whereas if I go somewhere else, I'm already there. And so I'm doing it.;;change
124;high;managing life;37;therapist;That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now. One is to maybe visit the YMCA and-and find out how much that costs-;reflection;
124;high;managing life;38;client;Mm-hmm.;;change
124;high;managing life;39;therapist;-and the other goal being maybe just a walk, um, one time between now and the next time I see you. Um, and I say one time, you can, of course, go more than that, but just with snow in the forecast, it might be reasonable to start with a small goal like th;reflection;
124;high;managing life;40;client;No, that sounds good. I-I definitely think, um, I'll walk probably more than one time in the next couple of weeks, but, um, I also have this app on my phone that tracks my steps, uh, and it was like built into the phone. It's nothing I downloaded or anything. So I can also use that to kind of see if I'm getting more active 'cause right now I think I'm averaging like 2,000 steps a day, so it's like a lot of sitting.;;change
124;high;managing life;41;therapist;Okay. So you'd like to kind of get motivated with- with the use of an app and that might help you get started.;reflection;
124;high;managing life;42;client;Yeah, I think so.;;change
124;high;managing life;43;therapist;Okay, fantastic. So, on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being really confident, I can research a gym and go for one walk, and zero being not at all confident, how are you feeling about these two small goals?;question;
124;high;managing life;44;client;I think I'm at a 10.;;change
124;high;managing life;45;therapist;Okay.;other;
124;high;managing life;46;client;Yeah. I think that, like I said, I think I'll find ways to walk. Um, and I'm at a point now where I've done as much research, I've found out as much information, I think, as I can on the gyms that are local here. Um, but I will check out the- the Y to see if it maybe is a bit cheaper and also a bit more, like, welcoming and doesn't require a- like, a six-month contract or anything like that. So I feel like those would both be good starts. Yeah.;;change
124;high;managing life;47;therapist;Wonderful. Are there any other barriers that would be helpful to sort of talk through?;question;
124;high;managing life;48;client;Um, well, if I'm trying to walk outside, the weather's always going to be one, but I, again, like I said, if I'm checking, uh, using the app on my phone to see my step count, I can maybe make more of a priority to walk indoors, um, and just find places inside that I could walk, even if it's just around the hallway or whatever that looks like-;;change
124;high;managing life;49;therapist;Okay. So being creative with your indoor space is a-is a solution you've come up with yourself for - f there just aren't any good days, nice days outside.;reflection;
124;high;managing life;50;client;Yeah, but hopefully there's one. So, yeah.;;change
124;high;managing life;51;therapist;Great. Well, you came in today feeling pretty discouraged about your energy levels and your mood and, um, feeling lousy about your body in general. And, uh, today we've talked about a small-small step to get started and you're hoping to experience some mood boost and some energy as you get rolling here. Um, how are you feeling about today's session?;reflection;
124;high;managing life;52;client;No, I feel really good. I think even coming in, I didn't have a like step-by-step idea of what I wanted to do next, but no, this has been helpful to know what those small steps are, and like you said, hopefully, I do start feeling better. Yeah.;;change
124;high;managing life;53;therapist;Great. Well, I look forward to checking in with you, and thanks so much for coming in.;other;
124;high;managing life;54;client;Thanks for having me. All right.;;neutral
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;Well, let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself.;other;
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;Um, pretty obvious [chuckles].;;neutral
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;So, what happened. So first of all, tell me what you did, exactly.;other;
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;What do you mean what I did?;;neutral
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;Well, I mean, where did you cut yourself? I know you said you cut yourself when you-;question;
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;That's the same as always. Same as always.;;neutral
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;Like your arm?;other;
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;Yeah.;;neutral
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;What did you cut yourself with?;question;
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;A razor?;;neutral
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;How deep?;question;
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;client;Do you wanna see it?;;neutral
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;therapist;Yeah. Let me see. You know those look to me like they-they-- did you go to the-- It doesn't look like you went and got any stitches, but that looks to me like you could have used them. What do you think?;question;
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;client;I think have you ever been to an ER when you cut yourself, you'd know why I don't go.;;sustain
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;therapist;Okay, but part of the problem is those look deep and like you're going to have significant scars. So my suggestion is in the future, if you do it, is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed. But let's talk about how, um, how this happened. First of all, tell me, you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die. But, um, did you-- Was this a suicide attempt or do you think it was just-just a cutting? Were thinking of killing yourself or wanting to kill yourself or wanting to die when you did it?;therapist_input;
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;client;I was thinking about killing myself. You thought you would help me and you didn't. That's what I want to talk about. I wanna talk about how it is that my life is not going better and you are not helping me, and you are not available to me when I need help.;;sustain
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;16;therapist;Okay. So let's-- Okay, so it sounds like me not being avai-- Was me not being available with you, rela-related to you cutting yourself?;question;
107;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;client;I cut myself the first time I called you thinking you would help me, you wouldn't help me so then I figured, what the hell I [chuckles] might as well just go all the way. And so, that's why I cut myself that deep.;;sustain
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;0;therapist;Kia ora, Ricky, welcome back.;other;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;1;client;Kia ora.;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;2;therapist;Good. Are you okay today?;question;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;3;client;Yeah, yeah fine.;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;4;therapist;All right. So where we left last time, you were going away to think about a few things and to, um, develop some sort of plan of action. How'd it go? What were you up to?;question;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;5;client;Actually, it's been pretty good. I, um, I talked to my mom, which, uh-;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;6;therapist;Right.;other;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;7;client;-which is a big deal. And, uh, she was excellent. Um, I knew she would be. Um, and, uh, I've made an appointment for the, uh, for Stopping Violence and [unintelligible 00:16:15];;change
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;8;therapist;Good to know, excellent.;other;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;9;client;Um, I've cut down on the drink. I haven't stopped drinking, but, uh-- Yeah, so, uh, it's okay.;;change
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;10;therapist;Things are looking pretty good.;reflection;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;11;client;Yeah.;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;12;therapist;So you've rung your mom, had a chat to her.;other;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;14;therapist;Any other whānau members? You talked about your brothers and sisters last time.;question;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;15;client;Uh, I didn't speak to my brothers and sisters this time, I just spoke to my mom, but, uh, she, uh, she suggested that I go and stay with my, uh, auntie and my uncle. Uh—;;neutral

37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;17;client;Yeah.;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;18;therapist;Okay.;other;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;19;client;I'm not sure.;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;20;therapist;No?;question;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;21;client;I'm not sure, I'm thinking about it.;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;22;therapist;What are you not sure about?;question;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;23;client;Well, I'm not sure if I want to live with my auntie and uncle. [chuckles] Um, I think, yeah, I'll probably need to. I think probably living with, uh, with my mate in his flat is probably not that helpful.;;change
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;24;therapist;Okay. Just sort of interested, when you rang your mom and, um, told her what's happening, how difficult was it to talk about the issue of violence and being violent towards your partner?;question;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;25;client;It was terrible. It was really hard. Uh, I think probably the hardest person to talk to about it, my mom. My, um, my old man, um-- Yeah, it was hard.;;change
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;26;therapist;We-we talked about, uh, last time that this is hard stuff and that, um, we are prepared to kind of do the hard yard. So you've gone away, you've talked to your folks, put it out there about your issue of violence? Um, I'm thinking about, uh, with-with Tristan and the whole alcohol issue there. So it sounds like to me if you've- you've started to put quite a bit of stuff in place.;reflection;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;27;client;I try.;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;28;therapist;Yeah. What does it tell me about you as a man, as a father, as someone who wants to get moving?;question;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;29;client;Well, I hope it tells you that, um, that I'm a good bloke. That I'm a good dad. That I really- that I'm really serious. I am really serious.;;change
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;30;therapist;Grand. You talked a little bit about, uh, you'd really like to get back with Kristie?;question;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;31;client;Yeah.;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;32;therapist;And-and-and your kids and developing that whānau. Have you had an opportunity to get in touch with her and—;question;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;33;client;Uh, yeah, I talked to her about it. We talked a little bit. Um, and she's not completely convinced.;;neutral
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;34;therapist;Right.;other;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;35;client;Um, but we'll see how it goes.;;change
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;36;therapist;Okay. So what do you think you're gonna need to do to show her and others, uh, to convince them that you are serious?;question;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;37;client;I need to, um, I need to see all these things that I've started to put into action, I need to see them through to the end.;;change
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;39;client;Well. I need to- I need to, uh, to show her that she can trust me. That I'm serious about it.;;change
37;high;motivated towards adopting better life style;40;therapist;Yeah.;other;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Okay, so I'm just gonna ask you a couple of more background questions.;therapist_input;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Okay.;;neutral
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Do you use any tobacco products, or smoke cigarettes?;question;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;No, I would bum cigarettes in college, but I was never a smoker.;;neutral
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay. How about in the last year?;question;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;No, not really anything.;;neutral
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay. And how often do you have a drink containing alcohol?;question;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Um, a few times a week. Uh, Wednesdays, I'll go to happy hour and have about two or three. And then, um, Thursdays, seven, um, seven or eight. Fridays, probably just a couple of glasses of wine with dinner. Um, but Saturdays are bigger night. And I would probably have a few drinks before I went to the bar. And then have four or five at when-when I was out. So—;;neutral
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. So it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week, anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day. So, maybe around 20 drinks a week?;question;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;I guess, it sounds like a lot when you say [chuckles] like that. But yeah.;;neutral
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Okay. Do you use any street drugs like any marijuana, cocaine, heroin?;question;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;No. I-I smoked weed in college, but just a little bit. I wasn't a regular smoker.;;sustain
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Do you, um, do you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you, or ever use your own prescriptions in a way on which they were not prescribed?;question;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;No.;;neutral
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Okay. So, you know, as we said before, you're drinking-- it sounds like you're drinking about 20 drinks a week, over the course of a few days. And I did want to point out to you that the recommended limit for women is actually no more than seven drinks a week, and no more than three on a given day.;therapist_input;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Okay.;;neutral
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;So you're doing more than that right now. And when you drink more than this amount, it puts you at risk for a number of things, okay? Things like greater risk of injury, damage to different parts of your body, um, just a bunch of different problems. And, uh-- so I'm going to recommend that you cut down- cut down that amount to the recommended limit. Again, that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day. Do you think you could do that? Would that be a good goal for you?;therapist_input;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;That's a lot to change. I don't know.;;sustain
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Yeah, I know that making changes isn't always easy. But when you drink more than what's recommended, it creates problems. You know, you said you hurt your ankle when you came out of the bar this time.;reflection;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;I mean, the stairs were really steep. So—;;sustain
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Yeah. Well, it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol. You know, it can actually affect your balance and stability. So, really, you know, for where you are right now, you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended. And, you know, I want you to be healthy. And I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else. So I'm really gonna recommend that you try to cut down to that amount. So, do you think you could do that, cut down to no more than three drinks on a given day?;therapist_input;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Where are these limits from? Um, old- an older population? Because, uh, I drink just as much as my friends do. I mean, everybody drinks like I drink. I'm not even the biggest drinker in my group. So I'm pretty middle of the road.;;sustain
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;So, it sounds like, you know, the amount you drink is pretty normal-;reflection;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah.;;neutral
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;-amongst the people you typically drink with. But these limits are-- they're actually recommended for all adults. And studies have shown that when you drink more than this, it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about. So, you know, why do you thin;therapist_input;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;I don't know. It's what we do. It's-- this is how we have fun, I guess. It is fun.;;sustain
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Well, I think you can still have fun within these amounts. So that's what I'm gonna recommend. Um, I think this is a really good goal, and hopefully, we won't see any more injuries. Okay? So why don't you try that?;therapist_input;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Okay.;;neutral
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;All right. Thank you so much.;other;
17;low;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Thanks.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So now that we've discussed a little bit of your medical history and- and taking your vitals, I'd like to ask you a few more questions. The-;therapist_input;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Sure.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;the rise in your blood pressure is concerning to me, so I'd like to gather a bit more information about your lifestyle.;therapist_input;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Okay.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay. Have you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation?;question;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Not really, I haven't been stressed. Uh, I've been working steady, you know, these days, I'm glad to have a job, I really am happy that I'm working, so.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Yeah, that's certainly true. I'd also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure.;other;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Okay.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay, do you smoke at all?;question;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;I don't smoke. I smoked, you know, as a young adult, quit 20 years ago. I went cold turkey. I was proud of that, haven't even thought about smoking.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Okay, great. Um, do you drink alcohol, including beer or wine?;question;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Uh, I do drink beer, I drink, you know, two to three pints on weekdays, sometimes on weekends, maybe four or five.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Okay. Well, I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently. It sounds like you're having about 15 to 20 drinks per week, and that's definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure.;therapist_input;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Well, I-- you know, my pressure has been high for years and, um, you know.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Well, according to your chart, your blood pressure has gone up since July, and you said that you've been drinking more recently, so do you see the connection there?;therapist_input;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Maybe a little bit.;;change
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body. So along with contributing to high blood pressure, it can have a big impact on your liver, which you need to keep in mind. So your liver has several different roles in your body. First, it helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body. It also helps process alcohol and other drugs. So when you have an excess of alcohol, your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up, and over time, your liver won't be able to work as well.;therapist_input;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Okay.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Okay. And how about the use of other drugs like cocaine, heroin, marijuana?;question;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;I don't use heroin or cocaine. I've never even thought about using the hard drugs. Back in school, 20 years or so ago, I smoked reefer, you know. Once I got out of school, I haven't used that at all.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Okay. Have you ever used any prescription medications that weren't prescribed for you or in a way that wasn't prescribed?;question;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;No, I don't- I don't, uh, really like the idea of taking pills. Uh, as a matter of fact, a couple of years ago, I had this jaw surgery. They gave me a prescription for Percocet. I took one, maybe feel weird. I think they're still sitting in the medicine cabinet.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Okay, excellent. Well, it sounds to me like the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. I think decreasing the number of drinks that you have when you go out and maybe decreasing the number of times that you go to the bar each week could be the best thing that you can do for your health.;therapist_input;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Well, I guess I'll try.;;change
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay. And then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now. We'll recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this, sound okay?;therapist_input;
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Okay.;;neutral
9;low;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Okay.;other;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;And before you leave, uh, is it okay if we go over this screening form that you filled out today on your alcohol use?;question;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Sure.;;neutral
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Okay. Uh, thanks for filling this out. Uh, looks like you use alcohol two to three days a week?;reflection;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Yeah, but only on the weekend.;;sustain
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay. And then when you do drink alcohol, you typically have five or six drinks.;reflection;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah. Uh, maybe a couple more.;;neutral
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay. Well, the reason why I like to talk to patients when they fill out this form is because sometimes, uh, alcohol use can impact our health. Um, and my role is to be helpful. I can share some information with you about alcohol use, um, but I don't tell anyone what to do. It's always up to the patient to decide what they wanna do about their drinking. Um, so is it okay if we talk a little bit more about your alcohol use?;question;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;So, uh, are you saying I drink too much?;;sustain
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;How would you define drinking too much?;question;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Well, I-- If-if I was getting fallen down drunk or if I drink every night. Um, it's not like I get sloppy drunk or anything.;;sustain
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, in this country, the guidelines are men can drink up to 14 drinks a week or up to four on one occasion and still be low risk.;therapist_input;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;So I'm already at the week limit. And then I have four beers a night. Are you sure?;;sustain
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;So a limit of four a night doesn't feel right to you?;reflection;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;I have five or six beers when I go out with friends to a bar. It's not a problem for me.;;sustain
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;You're not alone in feeling that way. Uh, binge drinking can feel normal to some people.;reflection;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Well, I don't consider my drinking binge drinking.;;sustain
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Why is that?;question;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I don't chug a lot of beers in a row. I have about five or six beers throughout the entire evening.;;sustain
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Mm-hmm. Well, technically, we define binge drinking as having more than four drinks on one occasion.;therapist_input;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;But I'm healthy. What health problems are you talking about?;;sustain
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Well, uh, we know if someone binge drinks over time, there's kind of two categories of risk. There's the short-term risk where someone who binge drinks is more likely to fall down, hurt themselves through an accident, uh, they're more likely to drive while under the influence. Uh, but over the long term, binge drinking can also, uh, cause things like heart disease, uh, different kinds of cancer, liver problems obviously, and then even mental health issues like depression and anxiety are more likely to happen.;therapist_input;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Well, I didn't know about those things.;;neutral
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Can I ask you, uh, what do you like about drinking alcohol?;question;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Well, I-I like beer. I like the way it tastes, I like the way it makes me feel. Uh, like when I'm around friends and it's not a problem for me.;;sustain
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;And so what about your drinking do you not like or is there anything that worries you about your drinking?;question;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Well, that was fine until I came here, uh, but now that I know about the health risk, uh, I have something I gotta think about.;;change
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;So, on one hand, you like how beer tastes, uh, it's part of your social life to some extent, um, but on the other hand, you don't like the idea of it posing risks to your health over the long term?;reflection;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;E-exactly.;;change
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;So weighing those things, you know, what you like about your drinking, what you don't like about your drinking, uh, where do you wanna go from here? Uh, what would you like to change about your drinking?;question;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Hmm, I'm not sure. Uh, something I have to think about.;;neutral
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Well, how about hypothetically if I were to ask you, how would your drinking have to impact your life in order for you to be ready to change your drinking?;question;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;Uh, I don't know. Maybe if I got sick or something, uh, maybe I'd wanna change things then.;;neutral
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;So if you experienced a negative consequence from your drinking, uh, that would feel meaningful to you?;reflection;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Okay. Well, I like to give this handout to patients. Uh, it defines risky drinking, it talks about what the consequences are, uh, and it also lists signs of what an alcohol use disorder is. So thanks again for taking the time to fill this out and being honest with me, uh, to talk about it. I provide better care, uh, when I know about my patient's substance use. When we come back for a three-month follow-up appointment for your ADHD, I'd also like to talk to you and check in about your alcohol use too, if that's okay with you.;therapist_input;
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Sounds good.;;neutral
1;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay, great. See you next time.;therapist_input;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Hi, Nick. Thank you for completing the CRAFFT questionnaire. I also appreciate you sharing some information about yourself.;reflection;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;You're welcome.;;neutral
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;sI see from the questionnaire, did you have got in trouble while using alcohol? Can you tell me more about that?;question;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Well, a friend and I would snuck out one night to go to the park, and we got a couple of beers from his house, but the cop came by, and so we threw them in the bushes. He was originally gonna give us a curfew ticket but ended up not to. Luckily, he didn't see the beer.;;sustain
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;That must be really scary.;reflection;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Yeah, it was. If my mom would have found out, she would've killed me.;;neutral
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;I understand. So tell me, how often do you drink?;question;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Well, I've only tried drinking once or twice.;;neutral
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;I'm gonna make sure I understand. You have tried drinking a couple of times, and you almost got in trouble once. Did I get that right?;reflection;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Yeah, that's right.;;neutral
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;As your provider, I'm a little concerned about your health. Drinking alcohol could harm you, and I would like to share some information with you. Is that okay?;question;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Well, I'm not sure if this information is for me, since I've only been drinking once or twice.;;sustain
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;I understand. You're just experimenting with alcohol. Then, how about if you share with me what the effects of alcohol are?;question;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Well, all I really know is that it's not good for you.;;change
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Are you surprised what that might be true?;question;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Yeah, and a couple of my friends drink too.;;sustain
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Well, you might not be drinking that much, and other kids are also trying alcohol. I'd like to share with you the risk of using. Alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain is still changing. It also-- you're very high risk for becoming addicted. Alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals, especially in sports, and it could cause unintended sex. How do you feel about this information?;therapist_input;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;I really didn't think about how this would affect me playing sports.;;change
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Based on your reason for your visit today, I feel like you really wanted to play soccer, and you have great goals about that.;reflection;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Yeah, I would like to play soccer in college.;;neutral
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;That's a great goal to have for yourself.;reflection;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Yeah, I would also like to get scholarships.;;neutral
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Scholarship will really help you achieving your goals.;reflection;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Yeah.;;neutral
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;I would like to share with you these materials to show the risk of drinking at younger age. I also wanted to encourage you to think about these risks. What do you think about that?;question;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Well, I will take a look at it, and I'll definitely read it, and I don't wanna become addicted, and I would like to continue to play sports as long as possible.;;change
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;It sounds like you're in the right track, looks like you care about your health, and you care about your goals in life. I'm here to answer any questions.;reflection;
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Thanks for all the information.;;neutral
52;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;You're welcome.;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;So, Jill, um, I know you're here to talk about your blood pressure today.;reflection;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;Um, before we get into that, I see you filled out our annual screening forms here. So if-if you're okay, can we take a minute to talk about that?;question;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Sure.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;Okay, great. It looks like, um, the way you filled out the alcohol form puts you into our, uh, third zone of drinking. Can you- can you tell me a little bit about your drinking habits, where you drink, what do you like to drink?;question;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;I drink wine-;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay.;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;-mostly. Um, I go down to the little pub down the street.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Have a few glasses of wine.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Okay. Kind of socializing?;reflection;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;All right. How often do you do that?;question;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Hmm, for four times a week probably.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Okay. And on a regular night, how much do you-- how many glasses of wine would you guess you drink?;question;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Three to four, five.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Maybe if it's on a weekend, maybe six.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Okay. Okay.;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Over a long-- over a period of time.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Mm-hmm. Okay. So let me just show you on this, um, card here, um, from a medical perspective, we know that there's good evidence that shows that women you're age who drink more than, um, three drinks on any one occasion at any- at any sitting or more than seven in a week, are likely to run into health problems from their drinking, either problems they're having right now or maybe in the future.;therapist_input;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Are you serious?;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Yeah. Surprised, ain't you?;reflection;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Seven drinks in a week doesn't seem like that much?;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;It sounds like you're drinking a bit more than that right now.;reflection;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Yeah, and I-I didn't think it was much, but that makes it look like I'm drinking way too much.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;Mm-hmm. From this, uh, drinker's pyramid over on this side of the card, you can see that the-the score on your screening sheet shows that you're up in the harmful category of drinkers. So that it's likely you're drinking, you know, in quantities probably more than about 90% of the folks who come in to see me here at the clinic.;therapist_input;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Well, I know my drinking has increased a little since I got divorced and moved to Portland, but I-I don't think it's that much of a problem.;;sustain
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;It doesn't feel like a problem to you right now, yeah.;reflection;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;No, not really.;;sustain
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;Yeah, okay. And then the other thing I should mention, Jill, um, drinking more than these quantities, it's-it's possible it could be pushing your blood pressure up a bit, and I'm wondering if that might be affecting the difficulty we're having getting your blood pressure down right now.;therapist_input;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;I didn't realize that drinking had anything to do with blood pressure.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Mm-hmm. Yeah, it can sometimes.;therapist_input;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Oh, well. Well, then I guess that could be a problem.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;My perspective as a doctor, it would be good if you could think about cutting back a little bit or doing something different about your drinking. What-what do you think about that?;therapist_input;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;I guess I can cut down some.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;Okay. So on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to do that and 10 being very ready, where would you lie on that scale?;question;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;I'd probably a 6.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;Okay. Okay, so that sounds-- I think that's great. So why would you be up at a six and not down at a two level? What kinds of thing would push you to be there?;question;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Well, I didn't realize that drinking was related to my blood pressure problems.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;Yeah.;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;And I did fall earlier this year on my home from the bar and hurt my shoulder. I don't think the drinking made me fall, but it probably didn't help the situation.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Okay.;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;And though my son keeps telling me that I'm drinking too much, and it's scary to think that my drinking is harmful. It's a big word.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. So you've got some good reasons to try to cut back a little bit.;reflection;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;Sounds like it to me.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;Yeah. And it sounds like you're willing to maybe try not going to the bar quite as much and maybe drinking a little bit less when you go to the bar.;reflection;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;I think I can try to do that, yeah.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Okay. So to what levels do you think you could do that? Where-where would you wanna go with your drinking?;question;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;I guess I could use those numbers, and I can't make any promises, but I could try to drink less than three in a night and less than seven in a week.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Okay. Okay.;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;That mean I can only drink two or three times a week.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Mm-hmm. So you'd drink maybe just a couple of times a week and maybe a little bit less on each occasion? Is that what you're saying?;reflection;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Like I can try that, yeah.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;54;therapist;Okay. Okay.;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;55;client;I don't think I need to quit, but I think I can try to cut down.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;56;therapist;And you think you're-you're able to cut down to those levels of no more than seven a week?;question;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;57;client;That's what I'll shoot for.;;change
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;58;therapist;Okay. I think that sounds like a great step for you as your doctor. Why don't we revisit this the next time you come in to talk about your blood pressure in about six weeks or so and, um, then we can see how you're doing with it.;therapist_input;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;59;client;Okay.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;60;therapist;All right?;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;61;client;Sounds good.;;neutral
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;62;therapist;Well, let's get back to your blood pressure then and see what we need to do about that.;other;
101;high;reducing alcohol consumption;63;client;Okay.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;0;therapist;Thanks for filling it out. We give this form to everyone once a year regardless of why they come in. It helps us provide better care. Is it okay if I take a look at what you put down?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;1;client;Sure.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;2;therapist;So, let's see. It looks that you put-- You drink alcohol at least four times a week on average-;therapist_input;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;3;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;4;therapist;and you usually have three to four drinks when you do drink.;therapist_input;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;5;client;Usually three drinks and glasses of wine.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;6;therapist;Okay. That's at least 12 drinks a week.;therapist_input;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;7;client;Something like that.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;8;therapist;Okay. Just so you know, my role, um, when we talk about alcohol use, is just to share information about risk and to help patients who want help. This is different than telling them what I think they should do. I don't do that.;therapist_input;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;9;client;Okay.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;10;therapist;Uh, what else can you tell me about your drinking.;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;11;client;Well, I usually drink when I'm at home trying to unwind and I drink while I'm watching a movie. And sometimes, um, I take a bath but I also drink when I take a bath sometimes.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;12;therapist;Okay. So, can I share with you some information on alcohol use?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;13;client;Okay.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;14;therapist;Okay. So, there has been a lot of research on alcohol use and the guidelines we use in this country says that having seven or more drinks per week can raise the risk of health problems for women.;therapist_input;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;15;client;Hmm. Seven?;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;16;therapist;Seven.;therapist_input;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;17;client;Wow. I knew my doctor didn't like me drinking the amount that I did but I didn't know that seven was the limit.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;18;therapist;Yeah, you're surprised to hear that?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;19;client;Yes. What-what kind of health problems?;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;20;therapist;Well things like heart disease, cancer, liver problems, uh, stomach pains, insomnia. Unfortunately, uh, people who drink at a risky level are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and alcohol can make depression worse or harder to treat.;therapist_input;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;21;client;Hmm. Well, that's not good news.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;22;therapist;Well, how do you think your drinking relates to the depression you've experienced?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;23;client;Well, to be honest, I drink sometimes when I'm feeling down and I find it more interesting and not so blur.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;24;therapist;Okay. And how do you feel after you drink?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;25;client;Well, then I feel blur again.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;26;therapist;So, there are some answers on this form here. Uh, less than monthly you drank more than you intended to.;therapist_input;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;27;client;Yes on occasion.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;28;therapist;And sometimes you feel guilty after you drink.;therapist_input;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;29;client;Sometimes I just don't like how much I drink. I sometimes finish a bottle in one night.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;30;therapist;So you're not proud of finishing a bottle?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;31;client;No, it's not like I get crazy or anything but I just don't like the amount that I'm drinking.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;32;therapist;Right. By the way, binge drinking is defined for women as having more than, uh, three drinks and there are about five drinks in a bottle. So, you enjoy drinking wine because it helps make things, uh, a little bit more interesting when you're feeling down but at the same time you don't like drinking when you have more than you want it to and then the depression returns after you drink.;reflection;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;33;client;Mm-hmm. Yes, sometimes I feel worse after drinking.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;34;therapist;Where do you wanna go from here? What do you wanna change about your drinking habits?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;35;client;Well, I don't think that I'm ready to cut down to seven drinks a week. That seems like a lot but I would consider cutting back to two drinks a night. I think that would be my goal.;;change
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;36;therapist;If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;37;client;I'd say an eight.;;change
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;38;therapist;Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;39;client;Well, I'm more ready than a six because I'm ready to cut back on my drinking and I don't wanna make my depression any worse.;;change
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;40;therapist;What would help you cut back to two drinks?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;41;client;Maybe having less wine in the house.;;change
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;42;therapist;Having less wine in the house will help?;reflection;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;43;client;Yes.;;change
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;44;therapist;What else besides drinking helps you relax and unwind in the evenings?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;45;client;Well, I like to watch movies, read a book, and take a bath but sometimes I drink when I take a bath.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;46;therapist;So, it's not just wine that helps you relax. Um, there's reading a book, watching a movie, and taking a hot bath too.;reflection;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;47;client;Mm-hmm. Yes.;;neutral
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;48;therapist;Okay. So, it sounds like you have some reasons to cut back on drinking and you have ways to relax besides drinking and it sounds like you're pretty ready to cut back.;therapist_input;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;49;client;Yes.;;change
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;50;therapist;Great. I'd be interested to see how well you do on your goal in the next few weeks. Would you be willing to come back and talk to me about it?;question;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;51;client;Sure.;;change
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;52;therapist;Great. So, let's see how well you're doing with these new meds.;other;
0;high;reducing alcohol consumption;53;client;Okay.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;0;therapist;Tell me a little bit about what brings you today.;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;1;client;"Well, my wife is making me be here today. Uh, she thinks that it's a problem that I'm smoking weed, so she said, ""You need to go and get some help.""";;neutral
89;high;reducing drug use;2;therapist;Okay. Um, so you said that your wife said it's a problem. Um, so do you not feel like it's a problem for you?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;3;client;No, I don't think it's a problem at all. It's something I do to help me relax. In fact, I think it's something that is good for me, but—;;sustain
89;high;reducing drug use;4;therapist;Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about how, like, it's-it's not an issue for you?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;5;client;Yeah. You know, like I said, you know, I'll come home, I'll, you know, smoke a couple rolls after a long day or something. I'm able to just relax, not really think about things. You know what I mean? I'm still working and, you know, paying the bills. We have a house, so I don't- I don't know why it's a problem.;;sustain
89;high;reducing drug use;6;therapist;Okay. Um, is it causing any problems in areas like your marriage or anything like that?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;7;client;"I mean, I guess a little bit, you know, like-- I mean, she's the one that-that has me being here. We've been fighting about it, you know. Uh, uh, I don't know, I-I guess I'm-I'm getting pretty frustrated with her. She just won't get off my back about it. So I finally said, ""Fine, I'll go see someone.""";;change
89;high;reducing drug use;8;therapist;Okay. Um, so are you here to maybe work on your marriage? Is that an area that you are wanting to-to work on?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;9;client;Uh, I mean, I'm just here because she said that I need to be in here. So, I mean, yeah, I wanna save my marriage, you know.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;10;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
89;high;reducing drug use;11;client;And, I mean, I love her, you know, but I'm here because she's making me be here.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;12;therapist;Okay. Um, what is it that you wanna get out of being here?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;13;client;Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;14;therapist;Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;15;client;Well, I mean, I just failed the UA at work. Uh, I think I failed UA at work. I don't know. I-I use- I use some stuff that was [inaudible 00:02:00] not my system. But-;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;16;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
89;high;reducing drug use;17;client;I don't- I don't think it's gonna work. And so I really liked to be able to keep my job.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;18;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
89;high;reducing drug use;19;client;Um, I'd l- I'd like to stop fighting with my wife. Um-;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
89;high;reducing drug use;21;client;I guess those are my big goals.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;22;therapist;Okay. Um, do you see your substance use as being, um, maybe a cause of those other issues at all? Do you see them linked at all?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;23;client;I mean, yeah, I guess- I guess if I think about it, that's kind of the common theme.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;24;therapist;Okay. Okay, um, how do you think that your substance use is going to affect your employment?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;25;client;I'm pretty worried that I'm gonna get fired.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;26;therapist;Okay.;other;
89;high;reducing drug use;27;client;I don't- I don't really know. We're the only shop in town that-that does the work that we use. So I don't- I don't know what else I'm gonna go do.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;28;therapist;Okay.;other;
89;high;reducing drug use;29;client;So—;;neutral
89;high;reducing drug use;30;therapist;Okay. Um, and if you lost your job, what do you see being the consequences of that?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;31;client;Um, my wife might leave me. Uh, might lose the house. Um, can't pay my bills.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;32;therapist;Okay. Do you see that at all as being affected by the substance use?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;33;client;Yeah, it's probably- it's probably the reason why all that's happening. I mean-;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;34;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
89;high;reducing drug use;35;client;-If I lose my job, it's 'cause I failed the UA, so—;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;36;therapist;Okay. Um, so can you talk to me a little bit about, um, maybe where you wanna be 90 days from now? What do you want your life to look like?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;37;client;I'll still have a job.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;38;therapist;Okay.;other;
89;high;reducing drug use;39;client;Still have a wife and, uh, yeah, if I-- If those two things can happen then, you know—;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;40;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
89;high;reducing drug use;41;client;I mean, I know if-if I lose my job, she leaving me. She's been getting after me about smoking weed for a long time, so—;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;42;therapist;Okay. So that's where you wanna get to. Um, what do you think that you need to do in the next, like, month or so to maybe help going in that direction?;question;
89;high;reducing drug use;43;client;Probably need to go talk to my boss and start taking some steps not to lose it.;;change
89;high;reducing drug use;44;therapist;Okay.;other;
55;high;reducing drug use;0;therapist;Miguel, before we end the call, I did want to go over the answers you gave me on the questionnaire about drug use. Is it okay if we go over that right now?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;1;client;Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's fine.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;2;therapist;Thanks. When I looked at your form, it looks like you use heroin weekly and you injected. What part of your body do you normally inject in?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;3;client;Uh, mostly in my left arm.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;4;therapist;Do you mind if I take a look at your arm, please?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;5;client;Uh, no. That's okay. How's that?;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;6;therapist;Okay. Well, I don't see any redness. Um, can you go ahead and touch that Miguel, and tell me if it feels warm to you or if it hurts?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;7;client;Uh, nope. It feels okay.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;8;therapist;Thanks. Just so you know, when I talk to patients about drug use, my job is to be helpful. I'm not going to tell you what to do or what you should do. What I can do is share some information and be a resource. Does that make sense?;therapist_input;
55;high;reducing drug use;9;client;Uh, yeah, that's fine.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;10;therapist;Right. What else can you tell me about your heroin use?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;11;client;Uh, I don't know. Um, I use maybe a few times a week.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;12;therapist;A couple of times a week. And where do you get your syringes?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;13;client;Syringes? Uh, sometimes I'll buy them at Walgreens. Most times I'll just get them from the needle exchange.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;14;therapist;Uh, what one do you remember?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;15;client;Uh, Northeast Glisan.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;16;therapist;Okay. How often do you use new deals when you inject?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;17;client;Yeah, I use new needles every time, I never share.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;18;therapist;Yeah, it sounds like your health is important to you.;reflection;
55;high;reducing drug use;19;client;Yeah, that's right.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;20;therapist;And you showed up today to take care of your migraines.;reflection;
55;high;reducing drug use;21;client;Mm-hmm, yap.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;22;therapist;So, uh, you wrote on here that you've experienced withdrawal symptoms when you've stopped using in the past, is that right?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;23;client;Uh, yeah. Yeah, if it's, uh, you know, if it's been a couple of days like I can go two days, three days tops before I start to feel really sick.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;24;therapist;What does that feel like?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;25;client;Uh, geez. Yeah, I mean, it's the obvious stuff like my stomach feels sick, I get the body aches, uh, cold, hot, chills. Uh, everything hurts. Everything is in extremes. My emotions are in extremes. Uh, yeah, it sucks. I don't want to do anything. I just want to stay home and just stay in bed.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;26;therapist;That sounds awful. What do you do when that happens?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;27;client;Yeah, I mean, I start to use, I get loaded.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;28;therapist;Okay. How else does injecting heroin impact your life?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;29;client;Uh, you know, I get loaded and I-I can- I can function. I can go to work and, you know, do normal things, you know. Uh, I mean, there's been maybe just a couple of times where I wasn't feeling all that well, and I, uh, I was late a couple of times to work or it might overslept from the night before or whatever, but it's about it. Uh, I just want to avoid getting sick right now. That's my main priority.;;sustain
55;high;reducing drug use;30;therapist;Yeah. You want to stay healthy. I'm curious, what do you like about using heroin?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;31;client;Um, well, you know, I like the way it feels. Um, you know what I mean? When I shoot up my anxiety, goes away, my depression goes away. Uh, things that usually make life really difficult, uh, get a lot easier.;;sustain
55;high;reducing drug use;32;therapist;And what about your use do you not like?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;33;client;Uh, yeah. I mean, I think everybody who uses at least has some concern of overdosing on some level. Right? Uh, so that's something I'm concerned about is accidentally overdosing. And, uh, yeah, I mean, I don't want to get an infection in my arm, you know, just the usual things. I have a hard time hitting veins sometimes, and I gotta dig around a little bit and I would get worried about, you know, hitting something that I shouldn't or, you know, getting infections.;;change
55;high;reducing drug use;34;therapist;Mm-hmm. So on one hand, using heroin feels like an escape from things you don't want to think about. On the other hand, it puts you at risk for an overdose in infections.;reflection;
55;high;reducing drug use;35;client;Yeah, that's right.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;36;therapist;So weighing what you like and don't like about your use, where do you want to go from here? What do you want to do differently?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;37;client;I don't know.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;38;therapist;Well, some patients who inject heroin are interested in a medication called Suboxone. It reduces cravings, withdrawal symptoms without making you high. Some patients want information on how to inject drugs more safely or where to get new syringes. Other patients want to carry Naloxone which is a drug that can prevent one from overdosing.;therapist_input;
55;high;reducing drug use;39;client;Uh, are you talking about Narcan? Is that the same thing?;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;40;therapist;Yes.;therapist_input;
55;high;reducing drug use;41;client;Yeah, I got some of that already. I got it from the needle exchange.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;42;therapist;Where do you keep it?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;43;client;Uh, at home mostly.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;44;therapist;In case you see someone overdosing?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;45;client;I mean, that's a concern, of course, right? Uh, I'm on the app just in case somebody nearby is OD-ing and I can get pinged. But no, mostly I just keep it in case I overdose, uh, and, uh, I'm realizing now I have it but I haven't told my roommate about it so—;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;46;therapist;Your housemate may be willing to give you Narcan if they see you overdosing.;reflection;
55;high;reducing drug use;47;client;Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;48;therapist;Anything else you want to do about your use?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;49;client;I would really like a little bit of information on, uh, injecting in my arm.;;change
55;high;reducing drug use;50;therapist;Okay. I can email you some information on how to inject in a way that reduces the chance of infection and we also have behavioral health specialists in our clinic who can go over how to reduce harm with you. I bet the syringe exchange has similar resources too.;therapist_input;
55;high;reducing drug use;51;client;Okay.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;52;therapist;So it sounds like you have two goals right now. You want to tell your housemate about where you keep the Narcan in case you overdose and you want some information on how to inject safely?;reflection;
55;high;reducing drug use;53;client;Mm-hmm. Yeah.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;54;therapist;How confident are you to do these two things? On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 meaning not ready at all and 10 meaning very ready, what number would you pick?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;55;client;I'd probably say 10.;;change
55;high;reducing drug use;56;therapist;Okay. You're very ready. Why do you think you picked a 10 instead of a lower number like 8?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;57;client;Well, uh, I don't want to have an overdose and I don't want to get an infection. Seems like easy things to do.;;change
55;high;reducing drug use;58;therapist;What kind of plan could you put in place to make sure you meet these goals?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;59;client;Um, well, I can talk to my housemate tomorrow night. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't work tomorrow night so he'll be around.;;change
55;high;reducing drug use;60;therapist;That's great. And how do you want to get the information on injecting?;question;
55;high;reducing drug use;61;client;Uh, if you could email me that right now, that'd be great.;;change
55;high;reducing drug use;62;therapist;Okay. I'd like to hear how your plan worked out for you if you're willing to come back for another appointment. I look forward to hearing about what worked for you and what was challenging say in four weeks.;other;
55;high;reducing drug use;63;client;Uh, yeah, yeah. It's fine. Let's do that.;;neutral
55;high;reducing drug use;64;therapist;Great. I'll see you then.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;0;therapist;So I get a sense it's a little anxious being here today and, uh, meeting someone like me, and, um, what we're gonna be doing today is-is inducting, but also I wanna talk about, um, yeah, the issues that-that have got you here and we need to do some sorting out around, um, yeah how serious you are to sort of sort those issues. So?;reflection;
18;high;reducing gambling;1;client;I don't really know what issues I need to sort.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;2;therapist;Sorry?;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;3;client;I don't really know what issues I need to-;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;4;therapist;All right.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;5;client;-sort. It's just a bit of cash.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;6;therapist;Yeah.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;7;client;So—;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;8;therapist;So first, it might be trying to sort out what are the important issues to sort out.;therapist_input;
18;high;reducing gambling;9;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;10;therapist;Yeah, that makes sense? Yeah? So how confident are you that-that, you know, you can sort out the issues related to, um, you know, uh, taking the money from your employer? And another thing, in your precinct's report, there were some issues around gambling, and some issues around alcohol use. So those seem to be important issues that are kind of getting out. So how confident are you that you can get those sorted in the nine months we've got?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;11;client;Um, I don't think there is much to sort. I have a few drinks like everybody else my age.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;12;therapist;Yeah.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;13;client;Pokies are at the pubs for the thrills, it's no worries.;;sustain
18;high;reducing gambling;14;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;15;client;It's not an issue.;;sustain
18;high;reducing gambling;16;therapist;Yeah. See one of the things I'll be really interested in-in talking with you about is, um, yeah, what's-what's the, um, what's the worst thing that has happened in terms of pokies, in terms of you know behavior around the pokies, what's the worst thing that's happened?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;17;client;Uh, I suppose when you've got no money in the pocket at the end of the night.;;change
18;high;reducing gambling;18;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;19;client;And some nights you do, so.;;change
18;high;reducing gambling;20;therapist;Yeah. So how often do you end up with no money in your pocket? Can be the times when you end up with money in your pocket;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;21;client;Well, I don't really keep track.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;22;therapist;Yeah, yeah. So if we were to think back, say the last month, the last four weeks, how many times would you have gone down to the- to the pokies, the pub?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;23;client;I don't know. A few times a week.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;24;therapist;Yeah. Yeah.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;25;client;I don't know. It's if you're at the pub, you're, you know, that-that you're out there.;;sustain
18;high;reducing gambling;26;therapist;That-that you're up for the money and-and then-then they slot you.;reflection;
18;high;reducing gambling;27;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;28;therapist;Okay. So-so thinking about this, say a couple times a week, you know, two or three?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;29;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;30;therapist;Yeah, yeah, yeah? So that's 12 times. So how many times would you have walked away with money in your pocket after, any out of the 12, what's your- what's your sense?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;31;client;I don't know. A few times, probably when I have it, I might drink a drink.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;32;therapist;Okay. Okay. So you're saying about 50-50?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;34;therapist;'Cause you have to understand the odds are about-- sort of-of tend to be about 25% on the 100, that-that's [crosstalk];therapist_input;
18;high;reducing gambling;35;client;It's the unlucky ones.;;sustain
18;high;reducing gambling;36;therapist;Yeah, you might be lucky then. So-so what do you reckon like in terms of like you're saying you're not sort of sure if that's an issue, and that's probably something that we can be working with, uh, figure it is an issue.;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;37;client;Mm.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;38;therapist;And, yeah, it might be an issue, I don't know if it's an issue at this point. It'll be interesting to sort of talk about that. But I'm wondering what happens, yeah, when-when you get on the pokies out there, they're certainly at the pub, pokies around? So what happens in your body when, um—;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;39;client;A bit of a rush, I suppose.;;sustain
18;high;reducing gambling;40;therapist;A bit of a rush. Yeah. 'Cause other people I have worked with say that, yeah, sometimes they get a bit of a rush, that somehow the rush takes over and they don't know when to stop. Not sure if that's what- if that's what it's like for you, but other people have told me that, so.;therapist_input;
18;high;reducing gambling;41;client;Yeah, I suppose.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;42;therapist;Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So that could be an issue we could spend some time talking about here, 'cause obviously you know, you don't- you don't - you don't wanna be here, and then my interest now is just getting you o-out of the system, not getting you into the systems. So-so here, um-- how-how much do you think this is an issue for you, you reckon? The pokies and the gambling.;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;43;client;I don't know, I suppose it's lead me to be here, maybe. I don't know.;;sustain
18;high;reducing gambling;44;therapist;Yeah, yeah. Thinking about your friends, you know, how would you soft of think about your friends 'cause, you know, I guess you go out with your girlfriends and stuff.;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;45;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;46;therapist;Yeah, yeah. So, in terms of their behavior, like how did your behavior sort of match with their behavior? Are they much the same as you, are they different than you?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;47;client;Much the same, bunch of party girls.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;48;therapist;Yeah, yeah, yeah. Then, in terms of the pokies and stuff they much as they like doing the pokies so much as your doing the-- You know, compared to you doing the pokies?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;49;client;Um, I don't know. I suppose they walk away a bit quicker than me.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;50;therapist;Oh, okay, okay. Who's-who's-- What's your girlfriend's name, your best- your best friend, best girl friend?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;51;client;Sarah.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;52;therapist;Sarah, So what do you think Sarah would say?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;53;client;I don't know.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;54;therapist;What would she say about—;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;55;client;We'd just have a laugh.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;56;therapist;Yeah, what would she say about-- 'cause she knows you pretty well. She'll-she'll-- she goes to the pubs with you probably and see you putting the money on pokies, what would she reckon?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;57;client;Uh, no friends or friends should-- She accepts me for who I am.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;58;therapist;Absolutely, and that's what you want from friends, isn't it?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;59;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;60;therapist;You want that acceptance, absolutely, yeah, yeah. But won't you say, you know, friends also-- good friends also can, you know, call you on stuff too, can't they? Yeah?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;61;client;At times.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;62;therapist;At times. Yeah, so-so what you-- wha-what she might say to us about about- a-a-about your gambling?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;63;client;I don't know. You don't have any money, so-- And that she-she'll probably be quite happy if I stopped.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;64;therapist;Okay.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;65;client;But, um, I don't know. She-she doesn't really discuss it with me.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;66;therapist;Okay. But you owe her some money and you get the sense that-- Or I'm picking up, you get a sense that she's not terribly happy.;reflection;
18;high;reducing gambling;67;client;Mm.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;68;therapist;Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. So Sarah might see it as an issue. And-and I guess there's a part of you also sees it as an issue, part of you, you know. Part of you may not, but a part of you does.;reflection;
18;high;reducing gambling;69;client;Mm.;;change
18;high;reducing gambling;70;therapist;So the part of you that does see this is-- as an issue, yeah, that the gambling sometimes can be out of control, you know, tell me that part of you that-that maybe knows that, uh, it's getting you into trouble and it's gone way-- just moved you off from that point, there have been some—;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;71;client;Um, I don't know if pfft-- maybe I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for gambling 'cause-;;change
18;high;reducing gambling;72;therapist;Yeah.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;73;client;-you know, suppose in some way, I took the money for-for that but I don't know, you know? It's just a few dollars here and there and I didn't really think about it at the time, so-;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;74;therapist;Mm.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;75;client;-I don't know.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;76;therapist;Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that?;therapist_input;
18;high;reducing gambling;77;client;I don't know. I-I don't think it would have been too much of a problem. I mean I'm not a bad person, I wouldn't have, you know, wouldn't have continued to steal. It was just at the time that I was going through a rough patch. I wasn't intending to make it a long-term thing.;;change
18;high;reducing gambling;78;therapist;Yeah. Yeah, so you're not a bad person. Certainly, I don't make judgments about people being bad people. So that seems sort of actually thinking about this, you sensed that you could've stopped.;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;79;client;Yeah.;;change
18;high;reducing gambling;80;therapist;Have you put on a kind of real hat, you know, you get a real hat here, you know? What-what's your hunch about that? Is it a kind of-- that kind of realization it's a bit of a smoke screen, what's your hunch?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;81;client;I don't know, you tell me.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;82;therapist;How about then your-your kind of hunch about that?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;83;client;Uh, I suppose I didn't expect the-the money would've added up to what it did, so I guess, at the time, I- [sighs] I wasn't thinking of the reality of it, you know, building up, so-;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;84;therapist;Mm.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;85;client;-you know, it did, so I'm here-;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;86;therapist;Yeah-;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;87;client;-so, I suppose—;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;88;therapist;-so, what did it add up to, at the end of the day? What are we talking here?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;89;client;It's a couple of grand or something.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;90;therapist;Yeah, yeah. It's a little bit here, a little bit there, so it then adds up, yeah? Yeah.;reflection;
18;high;reducing gambling;91;client;Well, that a little bit here, a little bit there is nothing I didn't work for. [chuckles] I worked [unintelligible 00:10:35] and I was getting paid $18 an hour-;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;92;therapist;Mm.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;93;client;-$25, you do the math. [chuckles] And that's gonna support me?;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;94;therapist;Yeah. Okay. So-so, there's some-some questions you've got around some-some ways you, kind of, explained them. And then, as we work together, you know, we-- there might be some other ways we look at it and see it too, you know, that-that's part of working together. So, I'm wondering, how open are you to, you know, seeing this situation from lots of different angles?;therapist_input;
18;high;reducing gambling;95;client;I don't know. I'm usually an open person. [chuckles];;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;96;therapist;Yeah? Yeah.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;97;client;Just provided it will help me deal with it.;;change
18;high;reducing gambling;98;therapist;Yeah, yeah.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;99;client;Yeah.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;100;therapist;Okay. So, what other things have you've been open to at other times in your life when you've been open to-to new ideas and being able to talk about stuff, that may be tough to talk about?;question;
18;high;reducing gambling;101;client;I don't know. I am just usually pretty open with people. It's a bit different here tonight and-;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;102;therapist;Yeah.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;103;client;-just not knowing what to expect then—;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;104;therapist;Yeah, and-and, coming in, talking to a stranger, you know, and someone who can be honest to what you did, talking to a stranger, coming in this time, what do you sense about how you're doing so far?;reflection;
18;high;reducing gambling;105;client;I don't know. I suppose I'm saying that the money did add up, and that was enough for me to end up here, so-;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;106;therapist;Mm.;other;
18;high;reducing gambling;107;client;-I suppose I'm here for a reason. [chuckles];;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;108;therapist;Yeah. You know, like-- I-- And, some people wouldn't even, sort of, get in the door or wouldn't be as open as you've been today, okay, to an extent, so, you know, like I said, good on you, yeah. You know, being able to-- It's hard to come to a place like this and start to really open up, so, you know, you've just shown that you can do that. Yeah.;reflection;
18;high;reducing gambling;109;client;I didn't have a choice. [chuckles];;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;110;therapist;Well, you have a choice about what you open up to me about. Absolutely, you have a choice about that, yeah. That coming, being on sentence, no, you don't have a choice about that, um, well, you have a choice, 'cause, I mean, you can choose not to come, and you'll be breached and get to head back to court.;therapist_input;
18;high;reducing gambling;111;client;Mm.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;112;therapist;Um, but you do have a choice about how you are here when we meet, and what-what we talk about here. So, um, you know, so you do have lots of choices within that. And, my sense is you're, sort of, you know, a young woman who will make some good choices about that 'cause you're not a bad person, and you know that.;reflection;
18;high;reducing gambling;113;client;Mm.;;neutral
18;high;reducing gambling;114;therapist;Yeah.;other;
84;high;reducing recidivism;0;therapist;Hi Billy. How are you doing?;question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;1;client;Yeah, I'm all right.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;2;therapist;Yeah. Hey, it's good to see you here and good to see you here on time. Yeah, it's really good to see a good start to the-- to your probation time with us here is to see you being here on time. So how did you get here today?;therapist_input;
84;high;reducing recidivism;3;client;Just caught the bus.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;4;therapist;Yeah, caught the bus to-to that-- to the stop outside the office?;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;5;client;Yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;6;therapist;Yeah, okay. So I'm noticing that this isn't the first time that you've been to see someone at probation and it's not your first, um, community sentence. So I was wondering when you're sitting on the bus thinking about coming here, what was- what was going through your head about being here?;question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;7;client;Just a waste of my time.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;8;therapist;"Just was feeling like, ""Ugh, it's gonna be a waste of my time coming here.""";reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;9;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;10;therapist;Mmh. So how come you thought it was going to be a waste of your time? What was it based on?;question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;11;client;Last time didn't really work out that well.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;Yeah, didn't- didn't work out very well.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;Nothing really helped me.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;Okay. So you're hoping that it was gonna help you and it didn't. That was-- ended up feeling like a waste of your time.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;Yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;Mm. So it sounds you're worried that it's gonna be a waste of your time this time too.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;Yeah, I'd say so.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;Mm, okay. So what sort of things do you think made it a waste of time last time?;question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;She didn't really listen to me, just told me what to do. She just bossed me around.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;Okay, the probation officer we're talking about here?;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;Yeah, yeah, yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;Mm. So it felt like she bossed you around, didn't really listen to you.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;Yeah, she didn't really care.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;24;therapist;Okay, so actually having someone listen to you and hear about what you're saying is important to you?;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;25;client;Yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;26;therapist;Mm. So what's it gonna be like do you think working with me 'cause I'm also a female probation officer? Um, I'm wondering what-what's it gonna be like do you think?;question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;27;client;I-I don't care that you're a woman. It's just- it's that you don't know what it's like to be me.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;28;therapist;Okay.;other;
84;high;reducing recidivism;29;client;You have a different upbringing and live in a different place of town. Just-;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;30;therapist;Yeah.;other;
84;high;reducing recidivism;31;client;-you wouldn't understand.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;32;therapist;Okay, and all of those things are true.;therapist_input;
84;high;reducing recidivism;33;client;Yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;34;therapist;You're right. I don't know what it's like to be you and what I'm getting a sense of is that it's actually important that the person sitting opposite you in this role needs to understand what it's like to be you. Is that right?;therapist_input;
84;high;reducing recidivism;35;client;Yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;36;therapist;Yeah, okay. So I guess the invitation for both of us really over the next few months of, um, on the sentence is for us to get an understanding about what it's like to be you.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;37;client;Yeah, so it is.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;38;therapist;"Yeah, okay. So in terms of the things that have brought you here, in terms of the things that have got you into trouble and got you into offending, I'm wondering how interested you are in, um, really getting an understanding of it. So one or zero is like, ""Ugh, not interested at all.""";question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;39;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;40;therapist;"100 is like, ""I'm totally interested and-and getting it nailed and sorted and, you know, getting on the straight and narrow."" Where would you be on that scale?";question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;41;client;Well, not too high. It's not like I'm out killing people or anything. It's just-;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;42;therapist;Okay.;other;
84;high;reducing recidivism;43;client;silly stuff.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;44;therapist;All right. So it's kind of silly stuff that's getting you into trouble.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;45;client;Yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;46;therapist;Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah. So in terms of dealing with it, where-where would you be, do you reckon? How interested would you be in dealing with that stuff?;question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;47;client;Mm, lots. When I stop getting caught. Don't wanna be back here again.;;change
84;high;reducing recidivism;48;therapist;Okay, so you don't wanna be back here. You don't wanna be sitting here and-;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;49;client;No.;;change
84;high;reducing recidivism;50;therapist;to talk to a probation officer again.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;51;client;No, sorry.;;change
84;high;reducing recidivism;52;therapist;Okay. So where would you be do you think?;question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;53;client;Mm, like what out of a scale it would like fall?;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;54;therapist;"Zero being, ""Argh, not interested at all,"" 100 being totally into it.";therapist_input;
84;high;reducing recidivism;55;client;Mmh, 25.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;56;therapist;25, okay.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;57;client;Mmh.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;58;therapist;So I know that you're kind of 25% interested-;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;59;client;Mmh.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;60;therapist;-and really thinking about what's got you into trouble and hence something about what gets you into trouble.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;61;client;Maybe but, mm, yeah, I wanna stop getting into trouble.;;change
84;high;reducing recidivism;62;therapist;You wanna stop getting into trouble.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;63;client;Yeah, but I don't think what I'm doing is that bad.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;64;therapist;Mm, okay.;other;
84;high;reducing recidivism;65;client;Just unlucky.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;66;therapist;Okay, so getting into trouble and, uh, getting caught and-and we see [unintelligible 00:05:36] does about luck and this time being unlucky.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;67;client;Yeah, the cops just have it out for me.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;68;therapist;Yes, tell me a bit more about that, Billy? Kind of give me the [unintelligible 00:05:46] the cops have got it on for you?;question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;69;client;Just 'cause growing up dealing with them and my mates and stuff and there's, you know, guilty before charged or whatever.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;70;therapist;Mm, so it feels like you always seemed singled out and, um, end up being unlucky.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;71;client;Yeah, me and my mates always get singled out.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;72;therapist;Okay, so you get singled out and that's what, um, means that you end up getting-- having to go to court and get sentenced and end on probation.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;73;client;Yeah.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;74;therapist;"Yeah. So I'm wondering, um, if there are things that you think, ""Well, I can see that that's got me into trouble,"" and, you know, kind of cops aside, things that might have got you into-into trouble.";other;
84;high;reducing recidivism;75;client;Just jacking cars and just stealing just, like, stuff and smokes and got done for that.;;neutral

84;high;reducing recidivism;77;client;Yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;78;therapist;"It wasn't perhaps about the police singling you out. So those little things, well, you think, ""Mm, yeah, maybe-maybe if I'd done something differently, I wouldn't have ended up in trouble."" How interested are you in thinking about those things and-";therapist_input;
84;high;reducing recidivism;79;client;Yeah, well, I-;;neutral

84;high;reducing recidivism;83;client;end up in prison for the rest of my life for doing stupid little things.;;change
84;high;reducing recidivism;84;therapist;Okay, so you don't wanna end up kind of being in prison again 'cause you've done some time inside. Yeah, and you don't wanna end up going back to prison, yeah. So-so that's one thing about wanting to make a difference and the way things are at the moment, yeah.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;85;client;Yeah.;;change
84;high;reducing recidivism;86;therapist;Cool. What else would, um, would help to kind of keep you out of trouble do you think?;question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;87;client;Get some income, some good cash or something.;;change
84;high;reducing recidivism;88;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
84;high;reducing recidivism;89;client;A nice job.;;neutral

84;high;reducing recidivism;91;client;A good-- yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;92;therapist;"So the things about that have got you into trouble in the past, um, how confident are you that, um, that you can do something to not keep going down the same path? Zero is like, ""I'm not confident at all that I can make any changes,"" and 100 is like, ""I'm so supremely confident."" Where would you be?";question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;93;client;Pretty confident if I had a good job but otherwise, probably have to keep stealing stuff, I don't know.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;94;therapist;Okay.;other;
84;high;reducing recidivism;95;client;So it depends.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;96;therapist;All right, so if you were in a good job-;reflection;

84;high;reducing recidivism;99;client;Yeah, yeah, yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;100;therapist;-you really liked, you feel that you would be pretty confident to deal with the stuff that gets you into trouble?;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;101;client;Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause it's just small stuff that, you know, just 'cause I don't have any cash.;;change
84;high;reducing recidivism;102;therapist;Okay, so you don't have any cash and that's the stuff that causes you to do the small stuff-;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;103;client;Yeah.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;104;therapist;and get you into trouble.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;105;client;Yeah, just stupid little shit, yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;106;therapist;Okay, so if you had a job, you feel pretty confident, but if you don't have a job, your confidence is much-is much lower, is that-;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;107;client;Yeah.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;108;therapist;-what I'm hearing? Yeah.;question;

84;high;reducing recidivism;110;therapist;Okay.;other;
84;high;reducing recidivism;111;client;-not an excuse but, yeah, I'll probably keep doing it. Just try not to get caught.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;112;therapist;Okay, so if you don't have a job you reckon, um, you'll probably gonna keep on offending.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;113;client;Yeah. Yeah, I just get bored and stuff.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;114;therapist;Okay, so part of this, what's going on is you also getting bored?;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;115;client;Yeah, I get bored real easy.;;sustain
84;high;reducing recidivism;116;therapist;Mmh. Yeah, say something more about that. It sounds really interesting about you knowing that you get bored really easily.;therapist_input;
84;high;reducing recidivism;117;client;I don't know. I got a short attention span or something.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;118;therapist;Yeah, what-what makes you say that?;question;

84;high;reducing recidivism;121;client;Mmh.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;122;therapist;-all the time. But one of the things I'm noticing, we've been going here for a wee while now talking and, uh, I haven't noticed any lack of attention.;therapist_input;
84;high;reducing recidivism;123;client;Just talking about something I like. Like talking about cars is all good.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;124;therapist;Okay, so we [unintelligible 00:09:47] something that interests you.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;125;client;Yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;126;therapist;Mmh, and when we might be talking about something that doesn't interest you, what would I notice?;question;
84;high;reducing recidivism;127;client;I probably just wouldn't listen.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;128;therapist;Okay. All right, so-so one of the challenges is for us to be talking about things that interest you. Yeah.;therapist_input;
84;high;reducing recidivism;129;client;Yeah.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;130;therapist;Um, and also maybe get to the point where things are different in your life Where you're not getting into trouble and things feel a bit more sorted in your life.;therapist_input;
84;high;reducing recidivism;131;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;132;therapist;Hi, Billy, how are you doing? It's good to see you again.;question;

84;high;reducing recidivism;172;therapist;Am I picking that up?;question;

84;high;reducing recidivism;194;therapist;- I'm wondering if she knows that.;therapist_input;
84;high;reducing recidivism;195;client;No, not really.;;neutral

84;high;reducing recidivism;213;client;Yeah. It'd be cool.;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;214;therapist;Yes? So, it sounds like having children is something you've thought about? Um.;reflection;
84;high;reducing recidivism;215;client;Yeah, I know she'd be a good mum, yeah. So—;;neutral
84;high;reducing recidivism;216;therapist;Mm-hmm. She'd be a good mum?;reflection;

5;high;reducing recidivism;12;therapist;It's helped heaps?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;13;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;14;therapist;Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;15;client;Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;16;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;17;client;Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff-;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;18;therapist;Mm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;19;client;-and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;20;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;21;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;22;therapist;Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal.;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;23;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;24;therapist;Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I'm wondering if the Billy of six months ago would've done that?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;25;client;Nah. I didn't really think about it frankly.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;26;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;27;client;I don't know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it'll make things easier.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;28;therapist;Mm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;29;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;30;therapist;Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time.;question;

5;high;reducing recidivism;33;client;[clears throat];;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;34;therapist;Okay. So, what did you say to Donna?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;35;client;"[clears throat] Oh, I just said-- I said, ""Uh, could you give me a hand with this?""";;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;36;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;37;client;And, like, she filled them up for me, and I told her what to write.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;38;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;39;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;40;therapist;Okay. So, where did you get to in terms of telling her that, uh, reading and writing is not that [unintelligible 00:27:23] for you?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;41;client;Just-- I-I asked her to fill that out for me because I said I'd be too messy.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;42;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;43;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;44;therapist;So, I was thinking about how that stuff about not feeling confident around reading and writing has, um, really got in the way for you.;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;45;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;46;therapist;And I mentioned that's somewhere where you don't feel so confident, and I'm wondering what it would be like to feel confident with reading and writing. What difference would that make to your life?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;47;client;Like, a big difference, but, like, it's not like I don't try.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;48;therapist;Mm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;49;client;Like, I'm just not really good with it.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;50;therapist;Yeah. Yeah, I can really see that you're making an effort. In fact, I can see that you're really making an effort in lots of areas, not just in terms of reading and writing.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;51;client;Yeah. Like [unintelligible 00:28:13] if I'd got into polytech and stuff, so I think that's good.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;52;therapist;Mm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;53;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;54;therapist;So, where are the forms now?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;55;client;They're still at home.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;56;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;57;client;Yeah. If—;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;58;therapist;So, what needs to happen next?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;59;client;Just take them in.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;60;therapist;So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;61;client;Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I'll just drop them in.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;62;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;63;client;Uh, probably by the end of this week.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;64;therapist;Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;65;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;66;therapist;And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;67;client;I don't know. I don't know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don't even know any course that I'll do.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;68;therapist;Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course-;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;69;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;70;therapist;-and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;71;client;Well, um-- Well, I don't know. Hopefully, there's not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don't know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;72;therapist;Mm. Yeah?;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;73;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;74;therapist;So, all these changes that you've- that you've made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;75;client;Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;76;therapist;So, offending gets in the way of the life that you're starting to lead?;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;77;client;Yeah.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;78;therapist;Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;79;client;Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy.;;sustain
5;high;reducing recidivism;80;therapist;Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend.;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;81;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;82;therapist;So you've noticed that when you've been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;83;client;Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It's kind of harder to think straight.;;sustain
5;high;reducing recidivism;84;therapist;It's harder to think straight when you've been drinking?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;85;client;Yeah.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;86;therapist;Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;87;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;88;therapist;And that's helping keep you in check, as you said?;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;89;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;90;therapist;Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;91;client;I'd probably just go be stupid with my mates.;;sustain
5;high;reducing recidivism;92;therapist;Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength?;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;93;client;Yeah. 'Cause if there's just like if a mate said they're gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don't know. She say that's stupid and stuff. And I don't know. It gives me something to do.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;94;therapist;Mm. What do you think?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;95;client;Just kind of stupid. Well, it's pointless, but still a bit of a laugh.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;96;therapist;Mm. Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you've got about the job and a life with Donna and-;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;97;client;Mm.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;98;therapist;-kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn't fit in with that dream or that idea.;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;99;client;No.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;100;therapist;So there's that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there's the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you've had a few to drink and you're with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh?;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;101;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;102;therapist;So you've got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;103;client;Mm.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;104;therapist;And it sounds like sometimes when you're in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it's hard to hold on to that vision of the future.;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;105;client;Yeah. You don't really think about that. Well, just in the moment.;;sustain
5;high;reducing recidivism;106;therapist;Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;107;client;Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking.;;sustain
5;high;reducing recidivism;108;therapist;Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next-;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;109;client;Mm.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;110;therapist;-kind of minute or so-;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;111;client;No. Just, like, it's not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah.;;sustain
5;high;reducing recidivism;112;therapist;So it's not your idea. And you also go along with it?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;113;client;"Yeah. You can't really be like, ""Oh no,"" just give me shit.";;sustain
5;high;reducing recidivism;114;therapist;Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;115;client;Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don't know. And they'd talk me into it probably.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;116;therapist;Mm-hmm. So it's hard to actually say no to your friends-;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;117;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;118;therapist;-'cause of what they- what they thought of you.;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;119;client;They'd just think I was joking, yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;120;therapist;Yeah. So I'm wondering what the-the thinking, 'cause, um, one of the things that's really changed for you is being with Donna.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;121;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;122;therapist;So I'm wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;123;client;I don't see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so-;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;124;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;125;client;I don't think, like, I am not sure they like it.;;sustain
5;high;reducing recidivism;126;therapist;Then so when you're-- so you're spending less time with them and more time with Donna?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;127;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;128;therapist;Yeah. And you're saying you're kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you're spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;129;client;They don't lead me into trouble. But-;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;130;therapist;Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it.;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;131;client;Uh, like it's my choice though, they don't make me.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;132;therapist;Yeah.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;133;client;Yeah. I know it's just having grown up with, it's just what we've always done.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;134;therapist;Okay. So that's just what you've always done.;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;135;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;136;therapist;But we're also talking about this idea that it doesn't fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are?;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;137;client;Mm.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;138;therapist;Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;139;client;My life? Well, what do you mean?;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;140;therapist;Mm, well the stuff about when you're in the moment. Yeah.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;141;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;142;therapist;When you've had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;143;client;I don't know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;144;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;145;client;So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;146;therapist;Okay. So-so Donna's helped calm you down and you'd like, um, them to calm down too?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;147;client;Yeah, 'cause then we could hang out together and stuff-;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;148;therapist;Mm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;149;client;with our girlfriends and stuff.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;150;therapist;So am I hearing that it's tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes-;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;151;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;152;therapist;-now that you're with Donna?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;153;client;Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but-;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;154;therapist;Hmm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;155;client;-just, kind of, feel stoked that-that I see them on the weekends and stuff.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;156;therapist;Okay. So-so what's the definition, for you, of a good mate?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;157;client;It's, like, loyal-;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;158;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;159;client;-yes, someone who's got my back.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;160;therapist;So, someone who's loyal, someone who's got your back, yeah? What else? What else is really your definition of a really good mate?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;161;client;That's about it. It's-- yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;162;therapist;Hmm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;163;client;Someone who'll stand up for you.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;164;therapist;Oh, so, someone who'll stand up for you?;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;165;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;166;therapist;Yeah? Yeah. Sounds like a really strong definition of a good mate-;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;167;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;168;therapist;-for you? So, I'm wondering about, um, whether good mates lead you into trouble, if it's something you wanna do. If you got something different that you wanna do, what would a good mate do in that situation?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;169;client;I mean, support me.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;170;therapist;Yeah. How-how would you wanna be supported, Billy?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;171;client;Just don't give me shit about, I don't know. Um, yeah, just, if I- if I don't wanna go do something, don't, like, don't give me shit about it.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;172;therapist;Mm. Okay, so that's-that's the kind of support that a really good mate would give you? It sounds-;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;173;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;174;therapist;-like these guys have been around for you-;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;175;client;Yeah, yeah, they [unintelligible 00:36:38];;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;176;therapist;-for quite some time, and they're really important to you.;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;177;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;178;therapist;"Yeah. Okay. So, I'm wondering how we can get to that point where, yeah, you can say, ""No, I don't wanna do that,"" and they're supportive of you?";question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;179;client;Mm.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;180;therapist;What do you think it would take?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;181;client;Just they know that I'm serious.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;182;therapist;Okay. So, how would they know you're serious?;question;
5;high;reducing recidivism;183;client;I guess, like, if they actually know I'm going to polytech and stuff that they might understand.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;184;therapist;Okay.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;185;client;But, like I feel guilty if they wanna go and have fun, and I'm not with them.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;186;therapist;Okay. That's the second time you've used that word 'guilty'.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;187;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;188;therapist;Yeah? So, it sounds like it's a really-- something's really important to you about that.;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;189;client;Yeah. Like, just going out with them or spending some times with them-- time with them, but, like, I really wanna spend time with Donna too-;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;190;therapist;Mm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;191;client;-so, it'd be cool if we could spend time together, like, with Donna and my mates.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;192;therapist;Okay. So, it's almost as if you feel a bit torn because you wanna be with Donna, but you also wanna be with your-;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;193;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;194;therapist;with your mates?;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;195;client;Yeah, like-- Well, I know I get into trouble with them, but they're still my mates, and I-;;sustain
5;high;reducing recidivism;196;therapist;Mm.;other;
5;high;reducing recidivism;197;client;-feel--;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;198;therapist;Yeah, so they're still important to you?;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;199;client;Yeah.;;neutral
5;high;reducing recidivism;200;therapist;Hmm. I also am hearing that you don't wanna get into trouble anymore.;reflection;
5;high;reducing recidivism;201;client;No.;;change
5;high;reducing recidivism;202;therapist;Mm. Yeah.;other;
15;low;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Can I help you?;question;
15;low;smoking cessation;1;client;Uh, yeah. I just got off work, and apparently, they're going smoke-free, so I'm-- I-I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are. Some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and the-- they say they don't work really well. I don't really wanna quit smoking, I just need something to get me through the day.;;sustain
15;low;smoking cessation;2;therapist;So you want nicotine replacement, but you don't wanna quit smoking?;reflection;
15;low;smoking cessation;3;client;Maybe like da-- during the day nicotine replacement. Is that-- I mean, do you have anything like that?;;change
15;low;smoking cessation;4;therapist;We don't really recommend that. The idea is you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit, so then you wouldn't be smoking at work, but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either.;therapist_input;
15;low;smoking cessation;5;client;Well, I don't really wanna quit. I mean, I like smoking. I like go-- after work, I have a beer with my friends, and I'll smoke cigarettes. I mean, it's not really a big deal. Cigarettes aren't that bad. I mean, I know that the-- it's popular to say that smoking is bad for you but, you know, I like it, so I'm gonna be doing it.;;sustain
15;low;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Okay. Well, smoking really is really bad for you, you know. It causes things like lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease-;therapist_input;
15;low;smoking cessation;7;client;Yeah, yeah. Okay.;;neutral
15;low;smoking cessation;8;therapist;oral diseases.;therapist_input;
15;low;smoking cessation;9;client;Okay. Well, what are my options? You know, assuming that I'm right, what are my options?;;neutral
15;low;smoking cessation;10;therapist;Well, to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch. I can't recommend a patch to you if you're gonna continue smoking. That can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all, I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now.;therapist_input;
15;low;smoking cessation;11;client;Well, I mean, I s-- I-I-I smoke barely a pack a day. I mean, I've probably smoked for about five or six years now. It's not really a lot of cigarettes, but it's sort of hard to get through the day at work.;;sustain
15;low;smoking cessation;12;therapist;Okay. Well, we actually consider 20 cigarettes a day to be a significant amount, and in fact, I would then recommend to you that you would start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement.;therapist_input;
15;low;smoking cessation;13;client;Sounds good to me. The more nicotine, the better. Is it like gum or something? Could I chew it like while I'm in the office? That sounds pretty great. I mean, do you have—;;sustain
15;low;smoking cessation;14;therapist;Well, there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, and probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day, however, but gum is something you use just when you have a craving.;therapist_input;
15;low;smoking cessation;15;client;Oh. Okay. Well, where is that?;;neutral
15;low;smoking cessation;16;therapist;Well, we have that here, but again, the-the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking.;therapist_input;
15;low;smoking cessation;17;client;Well, I-- [sighs] I'm probably not gonna buy anything today. I mean, I just came by to see what my options are. I-- if-- thanks for the input. I mean, do you have anything else, do you have any other advice for me?;;neutral
15;low;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Well, aside from the gum, you could try the nicotine lozenge, that would be another option for you. Again, that's not something you'd wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement, but again, that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke.;therapist_input;
15;low;smoking cessation;19;client;Oh, well. Okay. Well, thanks. I mean, I guess that helps a little bit. I'll-- maybe I'll be back later. Thanks.;;neutral
15;low;smoking cessation;20;therapist;Okay.;other;
130;low;smoking cessation;0;client;Wow. I can't believe he fell asleep after all of that crying, poor guy.;;neutral
130;low;smoking cessation;1;therapist;Yeah. Well, the good news is he doesn't have pneumonia. It's just an upper re-respiratory tract infection and a cold. So there's some things you can do to make- to help him get better. You can avoid excessive dust. You can keep him hydrated, avoid over-the-counter cold remedies. Keep him away from people who have flu or cold-like symptoms and avoid smoke. And the last one should be easy because you quit smoking during your pregnancy.;therapist_input;
130;low;smoking cessation;2;client;Well, you're right. I-I did quit smoking when I was pregnant, but actually, um, a couple of weeks ago, I went out, my mom was able to take Jake for the night and my friends they were having a birthday party and we had a couple of glasses of wine and it felt like old times. So before I knew it, I was out having a cigarette with them. And since then I've been having a couple of cigarettes a day, you know, just at the end of the day after I put Jake to bed. But that sounds like it has nothing to do with what you're talking about, right?;;neutral
130;low;smoking cessation;3;therapist;No, wait a minute. That has everything to do with what we're talking about. I can't believe at the end of this appointment, you're just slipping in the fact that you've resumed smoking again. That's very, very important information for me to know. And I'd like to spend some time talking about it now.;therapist_input;
130;low;smoking cessation;4;client;Well, I had no idea that it was such a big deal. I-I didn't think it would have anything to do with Jake getting sick or, you know, hurting him.;;neutral
130;low;smoking cessation;5;therapist;Come on, Hailey. You're here because you thought he had pneumonia. You're telling me that Jake can't breathe, you're concerned about his breathing. And then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship? Do I really need to review all the risks of smoking in front of your-your child or exposing him to secondhand smoke not to mention the risks that you're posing to yourself and your own health?;question;
130;low;smoking cessation;6;client;Well, you know, I-I was doing perfectly well. It was just when I went out with my friends and, you know, usually, I'm fine with the cravings. It's just when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day. And if I have more than two or three, I just get that craving for a cigarette. And if I have cigarettes in the house, it just happens. You know, I'm doing pretty good.;;sustain
130;low;smoking cessation;7;therapist;So it sounds like if you have alcohol, then smoking is very difficult to avoid and you know what you need to do. You need to go home and as your-your son's doctor, I need to tell you you need to go home and throw out those cigarettes. You need to quit.;therapist_input;
130;low;smoking cessation;8;client;Okay. Um, well, yeah, I-I guess I can throw the cigarettes. And tomorrow night when I have my glass of wine, I'll-I'll just try to avoid that craving.;;change
130;low;smoking cessation;9;therapist;And let's talk some more about wine. You keep throwing wine into the conversation. It sounds like it's become a significant part of your daily routine. How much are you drinking?;question;
130;low;smoking cessation;10;client;Only a couple of drinks a night. You know, it's pretty rare if I have anything more than that. It's just my way of relaxing at the end of the day. It's been so stressful since Jake came along. It's just how I fall asleep at the end of the night.;;sustain
130;low;smoking cessation;11;therapist;Well, no one said motherhood was going to be easy, Hailey. So let's talk about these drinks. Are we talking about the-the low-risk drinking guidelines, one to two standard drinks a night or are we talking about a mug of Margarita's?;question;
130;low;smoking cessation;12;client;Well.;;neutral
130;low;smoking cessation;13;therapist;What are you drinking? What's the quantity that you're drinking.;question;
130;low;smoking cessation;14;client;I guess about- I have about a half a glass a night and maybe two. Very rarely I'll have more than that. You know, it just helps me kind of relax.;;sustain
130;low;smoking cessation;15;therapist;There's other ways to relax. There's yoga. There's deep breathing. You need to stop raising the roof and raise your kid. This is not okay. You're not just worrying about Hailey anymore. It's Hailey and Jake. You're a mom now.;therapist_input;
130;low;smoking cessation;16;client;I didn't know it was such a big deal. I-I never thought that there would be any impacts on Jake because of it.;;neutral
130;low;smoking cessation;17;therapist;I'm trying not to be hard on you, Hailey, but I've got to tell you as a position, it's a very big deal. Your drinking and your tobacco use are red flags for me and they need to stop immediately. So we've already talked about your plan for smoking. You're going home. You're throwing out your cigarettes. You're putting on the patches. What's the plan for the alcohol?;therapist_input;
130;low;smoking cessation;18;client;I guess I'll do the same thing. I'll go home and throw out the bottles of wine and stop having a glass at the end of the day.;;change
130;low;smoking cessation;19;therapist;Sounds good. And if you need to relax, go for a walk, join a moms group, read a book. How about you come back in a week when we have Jake's six months checkup and you can let me know how that quit plan is going.;therapist_input;
130;low;smoking cessation;20;client;Okay, I'll try my best.;;change
130;low;smoking cessation;21;therapist;Thanks.;other;
128;high;smoking cessation;0;client;Wow, I can't believe he stopped crying finally and fell asleep. Poor guy.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;1;therapist;Yeah. He wasn't too happy with the exam, was he Hailey?;question;
128;high;smoking cessation;2;client;No he wasn't.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;3;therapist;Um, well the good news is that the exam's over and I don't think Jake has pneumonia. What I actually think he has is a cold. So there are some things you could do to manage his symptoms. Would you be interested in knowing?;question;
128;high;smoking cessation;4;client;Yeah, absolutely.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;5;therapist;What I would recommend is that you avoid over-the-counter cold remedies, keep him away from any friends or family who may have the flu, keep him well hydrated, um, avoid excessive dust, and avoid smoking. And at least that last one's easy because you are an ex-smoker now.;therapist_input;
128;high;smoking cessation;6;client;Well, you're right actually, I-I did quit smoking but just last week my mom took Jake for the first time. It was a Friday night, so friends were going out to celebrate a birthday.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;7;therapist;Oh, fun.;other;
128;high;smoking cessation;8;client;Yeah. At one point in the night, though, they all went out to have a cigarette and I joined them. Since then, I've been having a couple of cigarettes at night, but never near Jake and never near his clothes or his toys. I mean, I've heard about second-hand smoking. And I-I don't want to be- expose him to it, so I've been avoiding him when I smoke.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;9;therapist;All right, Well, first I'd just like to commend you for your honesty and that's really helpful information that you shared with me. Thank you for letting me know that you're smoking again and-and, um, I also appreciate the fact you're taking so many measures to protect your son from secondhand smoke. Can I give you some advice on how you could protect him, even the- even further?;question;
128;high;smoking cessation;10;client;Yeah, sure.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;11;therapist;So, my sense is that you're smoking and you're minimizing hi-his exposure by not smoking in the same room and smoking near windows. Is that-;therapist_input;
128;high;smoking cessation;12;client;Yeah.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;13;therapist;correct?;question;
128;high;smoking cessation;14;client;Exactly.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;15;therapist;So what I would recommend then, is to move your smoking outside completely. As a smoker, the ideal situation for a smoker in the house is if their home can be made smoke-free and the smoking is moved entirely outside, especially while he's experiencing this cold.;therapist_input;
128;high;smoking cessation;16;client;Yeah, well, you know that sounds okay. While he's sick, I might be able to smoke outside in the next couple days or so, but the thing is, usually I'm craving a cigarette the most when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day. I put Jake to bed, I open up a bottle and I pour myself a glass and I'm finally able to unwind, so, I get a craving for a cigarette, so, I'm not sure long-term I'd be able to smoke outside.;;sustain
128;high;smoking cessation;17;therapist;Okay, so, what I'm hearing you say is that, it sounds like a feasible short-term plan, not ideal and not comfortable because what you really enjoy is that cigarette with a glass of wine, kicking back up on the sofa and chilling out perhaps while you're watching TV. And to maintain that long-term outside smoking outside in Canadian winters where it's cold and snowy, not realistic.;reflection;
128;high;smoking cessation;18;client;Yeah, exactly and another thing is that sometimes in the morning, after I've had a couple of glasses of wine, I kinda feel tired or groggy or low on energy, so, even that I'm not sure is completely relaxing. Especially if I've had a cigarette the night before, I always feel so bad.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;19;therapist;So, on the one hand I'm hearing smoking and drinking at night as a way to chill out but at the same time the next day, you're not feeling so great.;reflection;
128;high;smoking cessation;20;client;Exactly.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;21;therapist;Would it be helpful to give you some information on low risk drinking guidelines?;question;
128;high;smoking cessation;22;client;Sure. I've never heard of them.;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;23;therapist;Okay. Well, Hailey, what they suggest is that women don't have more than one to two standard drinks a day or a total of nine standard drinks in a week. How does that fit for you?;therapist_input;
128;high;smoking cessation;24;client;Well, usually I'm having more than two glasses but if you're saying that's gonna minimize some risk and I guess some of the grogginess I'm feeling the next morning, then maybe I should just try and have one glass of wine in the evenings?;;neutral
128;high;smoking cessation;25;therapist;So, it sounds like you'd be open to reducing as a way to still enjoy the wine but perhaps alleviate the way you feel in the morning, some of the hangover effects that sounds like you're experiencing.;reflection;
128;high;smoking cessation;26;client;Yeah, I-I'd absolutely maybe reduce. I'll try my best to reduce, but I'm not sure about the smoking.;;change
128;high;smoking cessation;27;therapist;Okay. So, you're gonna try to reduce the drinking, not sure about the smoking, what the plan is but I think we did agree upon earlier that you would move it outside, at least while he's sick?;question;
128;high;smoking cessation;28;client;Yeah. I think that sounds okay.;;change
128;high;smoking cessation;29;therapist;That's okay. All right and, um, I guess we'll see you next week for Jake's six-month checkup. Is there anything else we could talk about that might be helpful?;question;
128;high;smoking cessation;30;client;No. I think just talking about it was helpful, you know, and I'm- I'm glad you've given me some information. Maybe just this week I can think about it a little more, you know, I-I feel pretty overwhelmed right now. There's so much to do. My days are pretty full, so, maybe I can just s-sit on it for a week.;;change
128;high;smoking cessation;31;therapist;Sure, of course, Hailey a-and again I really appreciate your openness and honesty about letting me know what's going on with, you know, the stress levels and coping and drinking. I just had a thought that there's also a good mom's group, we run out of our center. So if you'd like a referral to that or some information, I'd be happy to give you and while you think about it, if you want to, um, talk about this further with one of my colleagues, I'd be happy to make you an appointment.;therapist_input;
128;high;smoking cessation;32;client;All right. That sounds good. Thanks, Dr.;;change
128;high;smoking cessation;33;therapist;Thanks, Hailey. We'll see you next week.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;0;therapist;Um, so you've talked a bit about like the emphysema. Um, what did the doctors say to you when you were diagnosed? I mean the obvious, right?;question;
39;high;smoking cessation;1;client;Every time I go-- Excuse me. -to any doctor, you know, you need to quit smoking and—;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;2;therapist;Mm-hmm. Finger comes out.;reflection;
39;high;smoking cessation;3;client;Uh-huh and I kind of go, let's move on, you know because I've heard the lecture. Um, and I really don't put much credence into what they say. I did have- I did have a neighbor who was smoked for many, many years and, um, she had the Oxygen-- Oxygen tank that she would have to sleep at night with the oxygen on and even that didn't deter me from that smoking. I don't really know. It's like, um, a power greater than myself. This is controlling me like this, you know, the angels on this side, the devil's on the other.;;sustain
39;high;smoking cessation;4;therapist;Mm-hmm. And there was a war going on?;reflection;
39;high;smoking cessation;5;client;Mm-hmm, yeah. And common sense somewhere in the middle.;;change
39;high;smoking cessation;6;therapist;Yeah. Well, and your daughter.;reflection;
39;high;smoking cessation;7;client;Right.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;8;therapist;And the social stigma, because you don't want your daughter to think of you like that, whatever that- that as a smoker, you know. You know there're people who make the assumption and it- it sounds like those are more important to you than the medical things, and who cares why it's important?;reflection;
39;high;smoking cessation;9;client;Right.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;10;therapist;It doesn't matter. So what- what ideas do you have about what might be most helpful for you in quitting smoking?;question;
39;high;smoking cessation;11;client;Well, you know, I was thinking along the lines of meditation. Um, you know, I- I do practice yoga, um, not consistently, but on and off. Um, and when I was in the hospital, I had to do that breathing apparatus and they didn't want to let me go now, like, you know- you know what, I'm not doing that it's already blurry then to this thing, to see the level, um, some pretty obstinate about it and yet I want to do it, you know?;;change
39;high;smoking cessation;12;therapist;So that was helpful for you that it's a, um, I can't remember. I know what you're trying to get a little ball.;reflection;
39;high;smoking cessation;13;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;14;therapist;It shows you your lung capacity.;therapist_input;
39;high;smoking cessation;15;client;Right. Which I barely have any.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;16;therapist;But it might be helpful if you- if you quit or it's, you know, it did if you were gonna decrease or whatever, to see how much better you're doing with the ball going up and your lung capacity increasing, is it?;therapist_input;
39;high;smoking cessation;17;client;Right- right.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;18;therapist;Okay.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;19;client;Yeah.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;20;therapist;So, I don't even know where you can get those. I think—;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;21;client;Oh, I already have one.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;22;therapist;Oh, you have one?;question;
39;high;smoking cessation;23;client;Yeah, [laughs].;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;24;therapist;Oh, okay- okay.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;25;client;It came home with me.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;26;therapist;Oh, did you?;question;
39;high;smoking cessation;27;client;Yeah.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;28;therapist;Okay. All right.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;29;client;It's stuff that I learnt in class.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;30;therapist;It's so interesting because there's immediate feedback. I mean, that's immediate feedback. Um, so we're- we're talking about quitting or here quitting completely. What thoughts do you have? You tried the Chan- the Chantix, meditation, you like that so, um, I can run some ideas that some other clients have used [crosstalk]-;question;
39;high;smoking cessation;31;client;That'd be great, yeah, please.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;32;therapist;So, um, since you like meditation so much, it's highly likely that you'd be a great candidate for hypnotherapy.;therapist_input;
39;high;smoking cessation;33;client;That's- that's something I'd be really interested in.;;change
39;high;smoking cessation;34;therapist;Yeah, okay.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;35;client;Yeah. I mean, I- I, um, I've always liked therapy itself, and I- I've heard, I don't know if it's accurate, but if you have the willingness that is you're ease- more easily hypnotized, I don't know is it true?;;change
39;high;smoking cessation;36;therapist;Yes, it is true. Yeah. It is. I mean, people don't come walking through the door who are not interested in it, you know? So, um, yeah, so that's-- So you'd be interested in something like that and, um, what- what other ideas have you thought about that would work for you?;question;
39;high;smoking cessation;37;client;Well, I mean exercise, but really, you know, I have the mindset, you know, like, okay, tomorrow I'm going to get up and I'm going to do this, but I really am not a follow-through type of person with this.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;38;therapist;Okay. Okay.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;39;client;Because you know I've never been really athletic. I mean, so it's kind of like, I know that when you substitute something for something else, other than chocolate, which is my best friend too, [laughs].;;change
39;high;smoking cessation;40;therapist;Might become a better friend when you quit.;reflection;
39;high;smoking cessation;41;client;Yeah.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;42;therapist;Um, because I know you mentioned you tried the Chantix. Um, what have you tried? Uh, Zyban or Wellbutrin?;question;
39;high;smoking cessation;43;client;You know, I've heard of Welbutrin.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;44;therapist;Okay.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;45;client;My girlfriend quit smoking. She quit drinking. She quit doing everything with this Wellbutrin. Now I- I- I am on some medications, like some, like I think that's an antidepressant.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;46;therapist;Yes, it is.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;47;client;Okay. Um, I'd be open to that and then I'm not sure-- I'm not familiar with the other thing that you had suggested. Um, I don't know what that is.;;change
39;high;smoking cessation;48;therapist;It's the same thing. It's Wellbutrin, and when they found out by accident through what we call serendipity that you know what, Viagra. [laughs] That when- when people were on Wellbutrin that they tended to decrease and stop smoking, and, um, there were a couple of different reasons for that. Number one, people tend to get depressed when they quit smoking, because it puts you in such a state of deprivation and, um also-- well, so Wellbutrin really is a good antidepressant for them.;therapist_input;
39;high;smoking cessation;49;therapist;The other thing is its a slight stimulatory effect and when people go off nicotine which is a stimulant the-they tend to get pretty tired overheard-- you know it's the opposite of however the nicotine makes them feel. And the Wellbutrin kind of with stimul-- you know stimulatory enough. [crosstalk] [unintelligible 00:05:56] And I-- the last I've read, and I've not kept real current about it, but I'm wondering about the-- what your thoughts are if any about the-- any of the nicotine replacements like the gum patch, the inhaler.;therapist_input;
39;high;smoking cessation;50;client;Um, you know I'd be-- I've heard a little bit about them, but I mean I do know some people, but they're not exactly reliable, um, as far as you know really having a desire and sticking to it that they smoke on the patch and-and then it causes this you know extreme, you know? Like you're getting double the nicotine or whatever so it's almost like they're getting a buzz from it you know so that's my fear and the cost of the patch because it's not covered you know through your, um, your- your insurance and the Nicorette same thing it's very expensive you know. And I'm not really a gum sure but here I am because—;;sustain
39;high;smoking cessation;51;therapist;Chewing gum.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;52;client;[laughs] but I mean I'd be interested I wish they'd make it more affordable for people or you know they haven't covered by insurance because you know the risk of it you know that the premiums for insurance- insurance for people who smoke are so high you would think that they would have like, um, what do they call that? Preventive. Um, I wish I never would have started and I'm proud of my daughter you know because I started smoking a little bit earlier than her age, and I'm proud that she is at this point not smoking this manifestation she might pick it up but it's- it's like-;;change
39;high;smoking cessation;53;therapist;That strong spirit of you got instilled with her.;reflection;
39;high;smoking cessation;54;client;Yeah-yeah, maybe I'm the best example of why she doesn't want to [laughs] you know;;change
39;high;smoking cessation;55;therapist;Could be?;question;
39;high;smoking cessation;56;client;Whatever you know and her friends. I think a lot of her friend's parents don't smoke and I'm constantly running like outside to smoke and-and-;;change
39;high;smoking cessation;57;therapist;It is becoming a pain in the butt;reflection;
39;high;smoking cessation;58;client;It is. It really is. It's a monkey on my back;;change
39;high;smoking cessation;59;therapist;Mm-hmm;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;60;client;And um for me smoking is like a calming effect, you know. And some people it's a stimulant you know and then for me, it's like, I look forward to relaxing on my couch after a long day and then watching my you know news or whatever the heck I'm watching or reading and having my cigarette, um, I'll tell you-;;sustain
39;high;smoking cessation;61;therapist;Like it's a little treat.;reflection;
39;high;smoking cessation;62;client;Right. Exactly or you know like I'll do some work, and then I'm like okay you know as my ex-husband says Union break and it's a cigarette break. [laughs];;sustain
39;high;smoking cessation;63;therapist;I've never heard of Union break. I love it how you said. I love it.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;64;client;Yeah. Absolutely it's not my quote but he actually he would mind.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;65;therapist;I love it. Union break.;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;66;client;Yeah;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;67;therapist;It's great;other;
39;high;smoking cessation;68;client;Yeah, you know how those union workers have to have you know, Union break.;;neutral
39;high;smoking cessation;69;therapist;Union break. Yeah. le-leverage, and you know so it's something else you might know about nicotine is, um is that actually depending on how you smoke it, it can- it can be stimulant when you want it to be a stimulant if you smoke it in short, shallow puffs and then it can be a depressant like after a meal and you take longer inhalations, and it really tends to act on your central nervous system as a depressant. So it kind of does whatever you want at any given moment and yet there is this price that you pay;therapist_input;
39;high;smoking cessation;70;client;Yeah, financially too, which is [inaudible 00:09:27];;change
39;high;smoking cessation;71;therapist;Financially. Right, getting back to the finances and you know, you know, you know I'm thinking your daughter what a pain but it's become the finances the emphysema. I'm really-- because I would think that in 10 years, how much are you smoking now?;question;
39;high;smoking cessation;72;client;Well, uh;;neutral
60;high;smoking cessation;0;client;It's good.;;neutral
60;high;smoking cessation;1;therapist;Yeah.;other;
60;high;smoking cessation;2;client;Um, another thing-- Wait, what, I had something, it's just [inaudible 00:00:03] that I wanted to ask you, um, now a lot of my friends have quit smoking. They're getting like ostracized, but, you know, I tend to, like, gravitate, you know, towards-- Like my ex-husband smokes, you know-;;sustain
60;high;smoking cessation;3;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
60;high;smoking cessation;4;client;so I find it like acceptable in that regard.;;sustain
60;high;smoking cessation;5;therapist;You bond other smokers.;reflection;

60;high;smoking cessation;7;therapist;That's very common. I mean, you go where you know, um, no one's gonna look down on you.;reflection;
60;high;smoking cessation;8;client;Yeah.;;neutral
60;high;smoking cessation;9;therapist;And you're instant friends.;reflection;
60;high;smoking cessation;10;client;"Yeah, we share-- ""Okay, oh, a smoker, let's go out and have a smoke together,"" yeah.";;sustain

60;high;smoking cessation;14;client;I like that piece of jewelry, can I? [laughs];;neutral
60;high;smoking cessation;15;therapist;Right, yeah, but with cigarettes, there is a sharing. You don't see that with any other drugs?;reflection;
60;high;smoking cessation;16;client;Right. Right, yeah. You can't have my stash. [laughs];;neutral
60;high;smoking cessation;17;therapist;You can't, no, not one of mine. So, um when are you thinking you might want to do this?;question;
60;high;smoking cessation;18;client;Um, you know, I guess I'll have to like, you know, get all of my information together.;;change
60;high;smoking cessation;19;therapist;Okay. Do your homework.;reflection;
60;high;smoking cessation;20;client;Right, do my homework and set up my like to have everything available to me.;;change
60;high;smoking cessation;21;therapist;Okay.;other;
60;high;smoking cessation;22;client;And then maybe set up another appointment with you.;;change
60;high;smoking cessation;23;therapist;Okay.;other;

60;high;smoking cessation;27;therapist;Okay. Yeah, no, all those things are good. I mean, I think you know, the will- picking a quit date has been found to be really effective. And, um, uh, I know you had talked earlier and then we'll end in just a couple minutes, but about, you know, like, the willingness or the readiness and most-- a lot of people, a lot of my clients have shared with me that when they woke up that morning, they truly had no idea that was going to be their last cigarette.;therapist_input;
60;high;smoking cessation;28;client;Oh, really? So they didn't have an exact date, they just decided.;;neutral
60;high;smoking cessation;29;therapist;No. Or- or some of them didn't have an exact date, but m-more importantly, was they-they just didn't know that was the day.;therapist_input;

60;high;smoking cessation;31;therapist;Right, right. It's just like you-you-you-- Some people pick a quit date, like January 1st is still the most popular quit date—;therapist_input;

60;high;smoking cessation;60;client;Oh, that's awesome, to know too.;;neutral
60;high;smoking cessation;61;therapist;Yeah. And, um, the same with the Nicorette gum, because it- nicotine is an appetite suppressant.;therapist_input;

60;high;smoking cessation;65;therapist;If you will.

60;high;smoking cessation;66;client;Yeah, God, I don't think I could.;;sustain
60;high;smoking cessation;67;therapist;Yeah.;other;

Um, you'll do your research, you know, about programs and stuff, I'll give you any information I have and we'll take it from there. But it's sounding like the quit date might be coming up fairly-- like within the next two, three months.;therapist_input;
60;high;smoking cessation;76;client;Okay.;;neutral
60;high;smoking cessation;77;therapist;I, uh, mean that's up to you.;reflection;
60;high;smoking cessation;78;client;Yeah. And I mean and that's-that's a reasonable thing- [crosstalk];;neutral
60;high;smoking cessation;79;therapist;You get to decide.;reflection;
60;high;smoking cessation;80;client;-I don't feel like I'm like you know, it's gonna be-- I think gradually getting my- wrapping my brain around it will help, you know, before I just do, you know.;;change
60;high;smoking cessation;81;therapist;Yeah. Is it appealing the thought of quitting with a group at the same time?;therapist_input;
60;high;smoking cessation;82;client;You know, I always love, um, I've been in other group therapies-;;neutral
60;high;smoking cessation;83;therapist;Uh-huh.;other;

110;high;unidentifiable;0;therapist;today.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;1;client;Well, there's a lot of things that bring me here today, but the one thing that I want to focus on is the fact that I really want my son to grow up in a great environment, and just have, like, more than what I had growing up.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;2;therapist;Okay. So, you want your son to grow up in a great environment and to have more than you had?;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;3;client;Yes.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;4;therapist;Is that right? so that's on your mind right now?;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;5;client;Yes, that's on my mind. I love my son dearly, and I don't complain about the childhood I had, I had a great childhood. I just-- I guess every parent wants the best for their kids-;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;6;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;7;client;and-and I really want the best for him.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;8;therapist;Mm-hmm. Is there anything in particular that's happening right now where this is more of a concern for you than usual?;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;9;client;Yes, um, me and his father, like, we're-- We were engaged and, um, we're just not at that connection anymore. We're focused on what we want to do in life, and that's kind of put a hassle on our relationship.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;10;therapist;What you want to do in life? Can you explain?;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;11;client;Yes, I want to become a social worker. I want to help people. That's just what I love to do, and he, um, is currently driving trucks, and so it kind of like puts a damper on everything on our relationship, and we're just like mainly focusing on our son and-and it's just been hard, like, reconnecting.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;12;therapist;So you feel that your differences in career choices is-is having an impact on your relationship with your son?;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;13;client;Yes, I feel it is, and I just-- I always really wanted like a family, like me and the dad and-and the child.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;14;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;15;client;I-- That's how I feel, that I love my son dearly, but I want to provide him with that, like, we are together, we're doing it together as a team-;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;16;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;17;client;-because now that we're going away from each other it's made things more difficult.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;18;therapist;Mm. Okay, so your boyfriend?;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;19;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;20;therapist;Is he your fiance or your boyfriend?;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;21;client;Um, he was my fiance, but-;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;22;therapist;Okay.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;23;client;we called off our engagement.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;24;therapist;Okay. And he's a truck driver?;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;25;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;26;therapist;Does he drive long distances-;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;27;client;Yes.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;28;therapist;or just local?;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;29;client;He drives long distance.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;30;therapist;And so sometimes he's gone away from home for, what like, days, weeks?;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;31;client;Yeah. Days, and the longest was, like, a week.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;32;therapist;Okay. And so he's a truck driver and you are an aspiring social worker, and you have a son who you want to give a really great life to, and you feel that you and your boyfriend are in different, going in different directions-;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;33;client;Yes.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;34;therapist;-maybe? Is-- Can you elaborate on the part that you're maybe the most concerned about or that's the most on your mind right now?;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;35;client;I'm concerned that when he was just local, we were able to do picnics and-and-and do the whole family thing that I just really love, and even though my parents weren't together, we would still, you know-- They were really civil with each other and we would go to Disneyland, we'd go to the-the fairs, and you know, I feel like it's different.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;36;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;37;client;Even though I'm not saying that we-we probably won't be together ever, there's a possibility that that could happen, but I still want that togetherness than apart.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;38;therapist;Okay, okay. And so that-that realization that you're having right now is, it sounds like, it seems like maybe, just from your nonverbal, that maybe you feel like you need to make some sort of a choice. Is that right?;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;39;client;Yes.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;40;therapist;Yeah? Okay.;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;41;client;I feel like, um, I'm not, like, valued. We're not valued from his perspective. I mean, that's-;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;42;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;43;client;-what I can sense. I can't really make that a final say because he may feel something different.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;44;therapist;Well, you know that he's not physically available-;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;45;client;Yes.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;46;therapist;-to do these things that you want to do-;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;47;client;Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;48;therapist;like go On picnics.;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;49;client;"And so when he is available it's kind of like, I guess where he's at and where I'm at is just like, ""Why is that a problem for you?"" And I'm like, ""It is because I want--""";;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;50;therapist;"He's saying to you, ""why is it a problem?""";reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;51;client;"Yeah, ""why is it a problem?"" He feels like it's always me who wants these things and-- but I-I made it clear that, you know, I want our son to grow up with the togetherness-";;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;52;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;53;client;-especially like how my parents had it, you know.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;54;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;55;client;They weren't the best of friends but they could come together and, you know, it was better together than apart-;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;56;therapist;Yeah.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;57;client;-and so I'm feeling like there's a-a change and I don't know whether to roll with it or just accept it, accept it. And it's all a balance between mind and-and heart and that's the battle.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;58;therapist;So, your heart says you want this great relationship where there's like a true family unit and you can go on picnics and be together but your mind says, what?;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;59;client;Well, my mind says that it's not going that way and you can't make it turn that way, you can't change anybody, they have to change themselves.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;60;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;61;client;And if they wanted to do it then, you know, it would definitely work.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;62;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;63;client;And I feel like I don't wanna subject to just accepting things the way they are, especially if that's a concern for me-;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;64;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;65;client;-as far as dealing with the togetherness, I feel like if I have a problem, I voice it to you and we solve. You know, we'll try to figure out ways so-- I feel like I'm very more like, the collaborating person. Like, we gotta collab together, let's-- you kn;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;66;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;67;client;"""Let's not go over the problem over and over and over.""";;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;68;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;69;client;"""Let's try to think of ways to make it better."" And I notice that not everyone's like me in that sense.";;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;70;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;71;client;"And so, do I wanna eventually hurt myself in the long run? Or, you know, help myself by saying, ""Okay this is just accepting that he's not in that position, so let me just do what's for me in my heart and, you know-";;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;72;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;73;client;"-stabilize myself to be the best parent that I can be.""";;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;74;therapist;Okay, so you know what you want, you're not so sure that your boyfriend wants the same thing. His actions indicate that he doesn't.;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;75;client;Mm-hmm.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;76;therapist;His words indicate that he does or he doesn't? You're not sure? I'm not sure about that part either?;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;77;client;Yeah, I'm not sure about that part either. [chuckles];;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;78;client;Oh, okay, all right.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;79;client;Because I know that dealing with perspectives you can, you know, you can't really tell someone what their, you know, perspective is-;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;80;therapist;Yeah.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;81;client;-but I don't-I don't sense it, I don't feel it and, um, I think that's just what I'm going by and I feel like probably 98% true.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;82;therapist;Mm-hmm. So now you have this information and it's on your mind, is there-- have you given any thought about what you might want to do about it?;question;
110;high;unidentifiable;83;client;And that's where the sickness comes from.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;84;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;85;client;And that's what I'm confused about because, you know, I'm very-- the type of person that, I don't wanna hold things in but yet I don't want to have to keep explaining-;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;86;therapist;Mm-hmm. [chuckles];other;
110;high;unidentifiable;87;client;-to you, you know like, I don't want to keep going on, iterating what I want in this relationship-;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;88;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;89;client;-especially if I'm listening to you.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;90;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;91;client;"You know, I would want you to listen to me. And I understand by like in the position that I'm in, I've always been the receiver and, um, anybody-- so it's hard for people to like receive, you know, from me so, I'm just like-- Lke I was like sitting, um, yesterday I was kinda feeling down and I just never-- I was looking through my phone actually, this is really funny, I was looking through my phone like, ""Who can I talk to?"" Because I never really opened up to anybody.";;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;92;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;93;client;Cause they open up to me and I'm able to listen-;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;94;therapist;Mm-hmm.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;95;client;"-and so I'm like, ""Out of all this, I don't know who I'd-who I'd talk to.""";;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;96;therapist;Oh.;other;
110;high;unidentifiable;97;client;-and open up to—;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;98;therapist;So that's another realization.;reflection;
110;high;unidentifiable;99;client;Yes.;;neutral
110;high;unidentifiable;100;therapist;"It's like, ""Wow,"" it's really, really prevalent for you right now, you realize that you are the caretaker, you are the person who listens to other people but you don't necessarily have someone like that for you and so—";reflection;
